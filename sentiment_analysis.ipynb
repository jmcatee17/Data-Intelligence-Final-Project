         "Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here are some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.  This will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial and earnings reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 13, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website.  I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the course of the past year, the extraordinary and dedicated people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered strong, well-balanced growth, progress in developing our consumer-orientated capabilities and strengthened the many ways in which we deliver value-based care in multiple settings. Each of the five growth pillars we discussed with you at our November investor conference are powerful sources of opportunities on their own within large and expanding addressable markets. Yet what really unlocks the potential value we can provide to those we serve is the connectivity of capabilities across our enterprise.   For example, this year, we expect 4 million people will participate in fully accountable value-based care provided by Optum Health, almost 1.8 million more than we served as we enter 2022. We're achieving this by connecting benefits, care and other services to support our patients. Many of these patients will have a Medicare Advantage plan offered by UnitedHealthcare, or one of the many other payers who are accessing Optum's expertise and capabilities in delivering this kind of comprehensive care. We will serve these patients in clinic settings, in their homes, integrating behavioral care, supported by our data-driven clinical incidents and next best actions, and all coordinated to provide the right care when and where they need it.   Pharmacy is another area in which we are more deeply connecting consumers with our services. We engage 1 million people every day, finding the lowest cost options, managing their specialty drugs, offering vital in-person clinical advice at our community pharmacies, providing complex medication treatments right in their homes, or simplifying access through digital solutions in order to make the process uneventful for them. We believe this connectivity is a path to better outcomes for people and lower costs.   It's also driving growth. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 750 community pharmacies, nearly 200 more than we had at the beginning of 2020. We continue to see the impact these services have at a very local and personal level, helping providers deliver more complete care and better outcomes including medication adherence rates, which are about 90% compared to the 50% U.S. average. Our pharmacists are able to take the time to get to know their patients' treatment plans and support their medication management, collaborating with other care providers.   We're guided in pharmacy by the principle of getting to the lowest cost for patients and clients. A good example, as more biosimilars come to market, we're positioned to offer patients their care providers and payers significantly more choices in how to secure the best prices for the therapies they need. In addition to biosimilars, we're driving affordability and prescription benefits by combining formulary and cash market pricing to ensure consumers will always get the best economics.   Our life-saving drugs program has made very significant progress since our announcements last year. This program offers $0 out-of-pocket cost to consumers for drugs such as insulin and epinephrine. Our goal has been to make this available throughout the U.S. And as of today, we've been approved in 48 states for our fully insured business. Moreover, 1/4 of our self-funded employers have now chosen to add this offering for their employees, and we expect that number to rise.   Getting to this point in such a short period of time was only possible through the work not just of our teams, but of state officials and others in the broader health care community and we're grateful for their support.  Looking to the year ahead, let me focus you on a couple of themes you can expect to hear from us. One is continued scaling of our commitment to American consumers. You should and will have -- who should and will have an increasing influence over their care experience. Through our core innovations, product design, enhanced digital offerings and partnerships such as RVO Health and Walmart, you will see us driving this more broadly across the enterprise, becoming closer to the consumer, helping simplify their experiences and empowering their decision-making with greater transparency speed, convenience and support.   You will also hear how we are amplifying our technology capabilities. 2023 will see the emergence of an enhanced OptumInsight, bringing to life the opportunities that the legacy organizations from Optum and change creates, an acceleration of how technology can be used to health care providers and ultimately patients within the overall health system. We start this year well prepared to deliver upon the objectives we shared with you in late November, and with a deep sense of responsibility to do so on behalf of the people we are privileged to serve.   With that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon. Thank you, Andrew. While the calendar shows we are two weeks into the new year, our team's 2023 started many months ago and, in some cases, years ago. We have been laying the groundwork necessary to execute on our growth strategy and sustain our momentum heading into this year and beyond.   To give you a sense of how this develops, I'll step through some of the work that has been [ longer to way ] to ready our organization to serve even more patients and customers in this new year and provide greater value for consumers across a broad range of initiatives.   Take the many new patients we will serve under value-based care arrangements in 2023, deepening our presence in existing areas and adding new regions. Our team's preparations are extensive. That's because the transition to fully accountable care is not simply a matter of downloading a new app. The preparations include significant investments in clinical training, technology, network coordination and other activities to make certain we are ready to serve. These critical investments help us support both our current year needs and 9establish foundations for the growth into 2024 and beyond.   Our ability to serve people effectively has expanded beyond the four walls of the clinic with the rapid development of our in-home clinical capabilities. These services complement our clinic-based and digital offerings and bring high-quality care access to some of the most challenged and often underserved patients in this country.   For instance, for value-based patients, our in-home services have reduced hospital visits by 15% versus fee-for-service, delivering comparable health outcomes and achieving an NPS of approximately 80%. Within health benefits, you've heard us discuss how our innovation and commercial products is adding new growth opportunities. One of those is Surest, a unique solution to employers and employees who are looking for first dollar coverage and high transparency into quality and cost. The momentum behind Surest is strong and building.  Just two years ago, 1 in 25 national accounts offered Surest as an option to more traditional plans. Thus far in 2023, it is 1 in 9, and we expect it will continue to rise.   Our offerings for seniors are another area in which we plan, invest and build capabilities to provide new and valuable offerings for an extended period. For example, we continue to expand the range of clinical services we provide via our HouseCalls initiative. In 2023, we will increase the types of vaccinations offered, expand testing services and deploy even more real-time resources to address social determinants of health. Seniors place high value on being able to get care in their home. It comes with an NPS of 75 and is helping to drive improving retention levels as we head into 2023.   In addition, our advocacy service solutions help members achieve better health. Our solutions led to a 42% increase in closing gaps in care, up to 15% lower ER visits and an over 10% increase in clinical program enrollment compared to customers who utilize standard offerings.    Turning to health technology, let me offer a few early observations on our progress and long-term growth opportunities we see in this area. With the completed change health care combination, we are accelerating our investments to bring this vision of a more intelligent and simpler health system to market as rapidly as possible. We will continue to innovate in and deliver the software, data analytics, technology-enabled services, revenue cycle management and advisory services our customers expect. And we are executing on the synergies of this combination with most of the financial benefit coming from complementary growth.   OptumInsight is uniquely positioned to offer integrated, end-to-end technology analytics and services across the entire health care value chain. Along these lines, we recently reached 2 new comprehensive health system partnerships, with Northern Light Health in Maine and with Owensboro Health in Kentucky. The services we provide typically feature a full breadth of our advanced solutions, including information technology, revenue cycle management, analytics and supply chain tools. The key here is that our comprehensive technology solutions are resonating in the market, and we expect to see increasing momentum across all of OptumInsight as we invest in and finalize our integration activities.   With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex. Thank you, Dirk. The investments and innovations Andrew and Dirk described and that we shared with you in November, speak to a company that has tremendous growth potential as we head into '23 and well beyond. The opportunities to serve people more deeply are tangible and accelerating, building upon a foundation of strong growth in recent years, including our 2022 performance. Revenue in '22 of $324 billion grew by more than $36 billion or 13% over the prior year, with well-balanced double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.34 grew 19% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, growth of 17%. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flow from operations in '22 was $26.2 billion or 1.3x net income. We returned $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and deployed over $20 billion in growth capital to expand our capabilities for years to come.   Turning to the performance of our businesses. OptumHealth's revenues grew by 32% in '22 to $71 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 1 million. Revenue per consumer grew by 29%, driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we are able to offer.  Consistent with our comments in November, OptumHealth is off to a strong start in '23 and will organically grow to serve an additional 750,000 value-based patients this year. OptumInsights revenues grew 20% to $14.6 billion in '22. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $30 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion over last year. As Dirk noted, we are advancing our investments to more rapidly unlock the positive impact OptumInsight can have for care providers and patients. We expect to make a significant portion of these important investments in the first half of the year.   OptumRx revenues grew 9%, approaching $100 billion for the year, driven by continued strong sales and the expansion of our pharmacy services businesses. Both customer retention and new customer wins were among the highest OptumRx has ever delivered, laying a strong foundation for continued market-leading growth.  At UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of nearly $250 billion grew 12%. Our strong 2023 Medicare Advantage member outlook is consistent with the objectives we shared with you in November. We expect to serve up to 900,000 more people in '23 across our individual, group and dual special needs offerings, our 8th consecutive year of above-market growth. This consistent performance underscores the product innovation, benefit stability and high-value seniors have come to rely on from us.   Our Medicaid growth outlook for '23 incorporates an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations early in the second quarter. Our objective is to ensure that people will have continuous access to benefits. And when all redetermination activities are eventually completed, we expect to serve even more people than we do today across our state-based commercial and exchange-based offerings. Within our commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1 million additional people in 2023. Our new and innovative products continue to gain momentum with employers and their employees, which will lead to increasing growth in this market over the next several years. In sum, while this year is just getting started, the early performance we are seeing across our businesses further validates our confidence in the 2023 growth and performance objectives we shared with you just 6 weeks ago.   Now I'll turn it back to Andrew. Thanks, John. As we head into 2023, we're determined to build upon the momentum we've just described this morning, further advancing our mission and delivering sustainable earnings growth of 13% to 16% over the long term.   And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Happy new year. The company seems to be taking a lot of momentum across the board into '23. I wonder when you step back and look at the swing factors that say would push the company towards the higher end of the range that you've offered in EPS or towards the lower end, what are some of the biggest swing factors in your mind in potential positives or challenges? A.J., thanks so much, and happy new year to you as well. I appreciate the question. Yes. So first off, we do feel that we're bringing a ton of momentum into 2023. We feel across the board last year, very strong performances. Most of our businesses closed out the year, actually a little ahead of where we were anticipating even when we were at the investor conference. So strong from that perspective. As we look into this year, I think real standout for me maybe call out just 2 or 3 points. One is just the membership roles and just the scale of growth in our membership. If you look at UHC, performance during '22, you heard us talk about that just now, we're anticipating, frankly, another 1 million plus. I wouldn't be at all surprised if we didn't exceed '22  numbers by the time we get to the end of '23. That is a huge plus and signals a tremendous amount of engagement from the marketplace in our product set across all lines of business, whether that's in the government books of business in the MA platform, our determination to make sure that we look after folks in Medicaid as they go through redetermination cycles and, of course, in our commercial books where you've seen tremendously strong growth. So that's really an area which I think is building for us a lot of confidence as we go forward. And then you go across to Optum, and let me just call out record selling seasons coming through from our OptumRx platform. That's building a tremendous amount of pipeline growth for us within our business over the next several years. OptumHealth, of course, really rapid growth of value-based fully capitated lives. You'll see by the end of '23, we'll be looking after -- well, more than double the number of folks we were looking after at the end of '21. That's an extraordinary expansion, and we expect that to continue to grow hard. OptumInsight, this year will be an emergence of a new OptumInsight. That's a business where we know we can do better. We've known that for a long time. We've been itching to get going on the integration of change in OptumInsight, which we've now been able to do. We really leaned into that in the fourth quarter. You'll see that flow through very rapidly in the first couple of quarters of this year. That's going to give us a whole new cycle of product innovation. We expect that to be a big source of lift as we go forward, backed up by an increasing momentum of being able to sign up these very large health system partnerships. You've seen us do two since the investor conference in November in addition to the ones we already have. I remind you, these are very large scale, very sticky, multiyear relationships, really substantial sources of energy for the organization. So that really drives all of our momentum. I think where we land in the ranges we've given you is all about our ability to execute and making sure that our organization is focused on every single day, making sure we get every transaction right. We look after every patient in the right way. We make sure that we're looking after every consumer approach that we receive in the right way. And so execution is going to be what determines where we come out. The raw material in terms of the momentum for the company is just extraordinary as we look into 2023.  A.J., I appreciate the question. Next question, operator, please. The next question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Great. I was wondering if maybe you could just comment on the RADV expectations for February 1. We just had our conference this week, and there was a lot of talk about this and just what managed care is generally expecting out of that ruling. Yes. I mean, we're not going to get into a ton of speculation because obviously, it's very, very potentially imminent. And so not sure there's tons of value there.  But I would like to ask Tim Noel looks after our M&R business to maybe share some of his perspective on that. Tim? Great. Thanks for the question, Lisa. We talked about this a bit at the investor conference and don't have a lot of new information to share this morning, but let me revisit a couple of the key elements that we discussed a couple of weeks ago. So first, risk adjustment is really critical to providing broad and equitable access inside the Medicare Advantage program. Also a really important part of ensuring there's no disincentives for caring for the most vulnerable. We also continue to remain very supportive of additional transparency. And here, that takes the form of more timely and consistent reviews. And a few of the key elements that we're thinking about with respect to these audits is it's very important for CMS to include a fee-for-service adjuster to make sure that we're comparing original Medicare and Medicare Advantage on the same basis. And also, very important that we don't conduct these audits on decades in arrears. That comes with some challenges, of course.   That said, without the final rule set, as Andrew alluded to, hard to get really narrow and specific, but we feel really good about how our results validated. Some of our sample sets were above, some of our sample sets were below. But likely more specifics to discuss at next quarter's call. Tim, thanks so much. And Lisa, thanks for the question. I mean I think as you just, again, just maybe step up a little bit in the broader position, obviously the whole MA program is unbelievably successful and popular program for seniors across the U.S. And of course, the biggest proof of that is the number of folks who every single year volunteer to sign up to be part of this program. And we're seeing another record year of enrollment coming through as we speak.  It's super important that any changes, whether it's in this particular circumstance or any other circumstance, it's super important that folks are thoughtful about collateral consequences, making sure that what is really impressive program in terms of quality of care, reassurance provided to seniors, ability to deliver good value for the senior, good value for society, making sure that any changes are made thoughtfully and holistically is what we would be hoping to see. And obviously, we look forward to working with the administration when and if any further updates come forth. With that, Lisa, thanks so much for the question. The next question is from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. I was wondering if you could speak to the progression of earnings when you add physicians or large physician groups in OptumCare and how that changes over time. I'm specifically looking for sort of margin ranges as you first get started in the first year. When you break even, how long that takes? And then how long it takes to get to the ultimate margins?  And I'm curious if the scale that you've got now, half of this book is new in the last three years, does scale accelerate some of that opportunity? Josh, listen, thanks so much for the question. It's a really -- that's a big question. Let me just give a few thoughts towards that. So one of the key capabilities you need to be in value-based care at scale is patients. Patients because it takes 3 or 5 years of getting to know medical practices before they become part of our network and as we go through our expansion. Patient then in terms of how you go through the process of building the capabilities and skills within the clinical practices to move from fee-for-service to value-based care. And of course, that patient size is reflected in how long it takes to go through this from an economic and financial perspective. And that's why as we see this rapid development now, it's kind of OptumCare, value-based care is kind of an overnight success that took 15 years to build. And that's -- it's really a truth. And we're seeing that scale now come to life and all credit to the teams who are doing that.   In terms of what helps here, I think it's really building a muscle within your organization to continuously test, learn, correct. Test, learn, correct in terms of how we work. This is a very -- so very -- it's a somewhat delicate system because what you're dealing with, obviously, highly professional clinical decision makers on the front line who are absolutely, ultimately responsible for every decision they make in front of every patient. But you're also trying to make sure they have the right information to be able to learn from the whole system, the information we know about those folks and what's likely to happen, what could happen, what might be the best practice. And how can we get the whole of the system to operate at a higher level. Those sorts of pieces of progress, those areas where we relentlessly invested, give us opportunities to improve the clinical care. If we can improve the clinical care, the economics follow. So within this whole model, getting the clinical care right, getting people in the right facilities, making sure people don't spend too long in care facilities when it's unnecessary, making sure that illness is delayed, deferred because they're treated well that prevention is the priority, that's what drives all of the economics.   What we're seeing, Josh, is that over the last 3 or 4 years, we are indeed being able to bring our more recent cohorts to a better economic position more quickly. That's allowing us then to continue to invest more aggressively in bringing new patients into the system. And that -- it's really that mechanism, which you're seeing come to life at the moment. Hopefully, that helps a little bit. We'll take the next question from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Wanted to touch on cost trend. MLR was in line with your expectations for the quarter. But wanted to hear -- there's been questions about the impact of respiratory in the quarter. There's even been some discussion around a pickup in just overall utilization in December. So would love some comments on those to it, maybe just a little on how trend looked between the different businesses, commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Yes. Justin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Brian Thompson to respond to that, please. Yes. Thanks, Justin, for that question. Throughout the pandemic, we've been making these references to baselines, et cetera. I think, now being three years into this pandemic, I'd like to just ground an anchor more to our expectations as COVID has waned. And what I'm most encouraged by is that the fourth quarter played out as we had expected. And what we had set out inside our pricing trends are lining up really nicely as we look forward to 2023.   To your comments around the flu, as I had suggested at our investor conference, we certainly saw that spike. We have now seen that start to wane for, I think, five consecutive weeks here as we're moving forward. So to put it out like we had expected, really not a meaningful impact as I'm looking forward versus what we've planned for.   So what I'm most encouraged by is we're sort of out of that zone of the unknowns around comparing to baselines, et cetera, and really managing a book of business with greater predictability back to sort of the expectations that we had well pre-pandemic and encouraged about how all of those elements, including flu, are lining up as we look forward. Thanks so much, Brian. And Justin, thanks for the question. We'll take our next question from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the employer segment? And what I'm interested in is what was pricing like in 2023. If you think of the 6% commercial trend that used to be your pre-pandemic sort of levels, what was that like? And for those employer customers, how are they kind of waiting the need to get employees in the war for talent versus focus on maybe higher premium costs and how they're trying to control that? Lance, thanks so much. Let me ask Brian to kick off on that. Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll hand it off to Dan [indiscernible]. I'll start with the conversation around trends. As you well know, we used to share trend information back in the day, and stopped doing so simply because it became less instructive as we were pacing through this COVID environment. What I can share, and I think once we get to this zone of consistency, we'll return to those metrics, we're certainly encouraged by what we're seeing on the utilization front. I think we are seeing some durable shifts. We've seen it with respect to ER moving into urgent and in-patient to outpatient.   But on the flip side, as we all know, in these labor markets, we're seeing stronger unit costs. And as we all know, unit costs still comprise the majority of the overall trend. And as I had suggested earlier in the year, we did have a higher trend planning for 2023 than 2022. But in reality, that was really a function of the first half of 2022.   And again, I want to give that thought and belief that we are largely back to normal levels. And I think once we pace through 2023, we'll get to that zone where we can share those pricing trends. So with that, maybe a little bit more on the competitive dynamic, Dan. Yes. Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the question, Lance. The competitive dynamics in the commercial market remain the same as they've been, always competitive. We continue to price to our forward trend, and we have continued to do that.   As Brian indicated, there has been some modifications to that, but all within the range of what we've expected and all within the range of how we've priced. So we don't see any material deviations at all from what we've expected in our plan. And we'll take our next question from the line of David Windley with Jefferies. In Optum Health as you have added or about to add behavioral and home, more substantial home care opportunities and have talked about those in the context of value-based care. I'm wondering what influence those have on the trajectory of revenue per member served that's already rising at a pretty rapid clip due to the full cap that you're transitioning lives into. So the home and behavioral adds to that. Yes. So I'm going to ask Dr. Wyatt Decker to make a couple of comments in a second on that. But maybe just before he does, and I think we don't particularly break out what's driving the elements of that kind of consumer served number. But you can imagine that the move to value-based care is a big driver of that.   Now one of the pieces within the home platform, just to pick out 1 of the 2 areas you called out, David, is, of course, within there, you have a substantial amount of D-SNP population, right? So that particular part of the business helps us do a much better job of looking -- giving a much better end-to-end wraparound care for complex folks often found in the D-SNP population. And of course, they represent a different type of revenue profile compared to more of a community patient. So I just make that point.   So within the home piece, it kind of a derivative phenomenon that home creates a capability, which allows us to serve D-SNP folks better. That, of course, is going to be an accelerator to the metric you were focused on.  And maybe ask Wyatt to go a little deeper though, around how you're bringing behavioral along as well as home please? Yes. Well, thank you, David, for the question. And it's very timely. We view home health as one of the new frontiers of providing value-based health care because of the convenience it provides and the ability to access people, like dual special needs patients that often have very difficult leaving their home to get care. So you will see us both developing if you will, the platform of home care increasingly in a comprehensive fashion, as well as integrating home care with our clinic-based care model. So it really creates two growth vehicles for us, if that makes sense. And similarly, with behavioral, as we've seen during the pandemic, the need for behavioral care is immense in the U.S. market. And our ability to embed behavioral health care services within our primary care and value-based care offerings has been differentiated and will continue to grow, as well as our utilization of virtual behavioral care solutions in both the home and clinic environments. And so we're pretty excited about how this is coming together, and we're creating a differentiated offering that helps accelerate value-based care growth and provide that comprehensive care that people made. The next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen. Just looking for a couple of numbers. One, just going back to respiratory. Our recollection was maybe 4Q for you guys was about 30 basis points of MLR from respiratory. I know Brian said not meaningfully higher. So I'm assuming that means there is another 15 or 20 bps or something from respiratory this quarter?   And then just secondly, on the investment gain, about $400 million above the Street, about a couple of hundred million above the '23 guidance run rate. So just wondering, was there a realized gain in that quarter that's kind of above recurring or how we should think about that number? Let me ask John Rex to respond. Gary, go back in order here. So just in terms of be very similar with Brian Thompson's commentary in terms of what we were seeing in the quarter and I think forward. So those -- that incidence was modestly elevated in the 4Q, but I'd call it modestly elevated. But very much in line with what we would have expected. And when we were in front of you back at the end of November in terms of flu and respiratory.  Let's put those two together in terms of just combining that whole view. So elevated, when you take it into materiality in terms of the $50 billion of medical costs in the quarter, I wouldn't call it immensely material, though, in that element. But very, very consistent. In terms of investment income, probably wouldn't be very similar to what we reported 4Q a year ago in terms of the absolute level of investment income in there. I wouldn't -- just kind of like last year, probably wouldn't use that as my run rate stepping out into next year though. So we're still comfortable with how we established and guided for 2023 from that perspective also. So very consistent with that 4Q of last year, too. The next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Just interested if you could summarize your key M&A priorities for 2023, and whether there's any sort of shift at all in sort of the key trends that we've seen over the last few years, which have been a big focus on adding the clinical capabilities and the scale at both OptumHealth and OptumInsight. Should we think about that continuing to be the core area of focus or any other additional elements that are worth considering? Thanks so much, Scott. Before I ask John Rex to make a couple of comments on this, I'll maybe just make a few introductory notions. I wouldn't go into a ton of detail about where we're looking, but I would continue to say we fully anticipate continuing to deploy our capital effectively into the marketplace. You know that a hallmark of this company has been its ability to effectively and efficiently utilizes capital to supplement its organic growth, and that's been a big part of the success of the organization. We'll continue to do that. We have a substantial number of transactions in process as we speak. As you well know, we're obviously in the process now of bringing to life the Change, OptumInsight integration, which is super important for us.  As we look forward, it's a very interesting marketplace. I mean I would say that John will probably confirm this, I think what we see the pipeline of opportunities we see is probably bigger, deeper, more diverse than we've ever seen.  That's been a trend that kind of picked up probably early last year, certainly continued. We'd expect to see this year to be a pretty interesting year for us.  And it's -- you know our five growth pillars. You wouldn't be at all surprised to expect us to obviously align our M&A capital investment around our growth pillars. Beyond that, I'm not sure it would be necessarily wise for us to go too much more detail. But certainly, John, I'd love you to give a bit more perspective on how you're seeing the landscape and the environment. Absolutely. Scott, yes, so I'd start with just echoing what Andrew mentioned there, the way we approach this very much aligned with our five growth pillars and how we evaluate, how we look for opportunities, I should say, and where we think we should be pursuing investments and relationships.   I'd point out that these are certainly very long-lived in terms of the investments that we make, in terms of relational investments we make, in terms of understanding markets, particularly as we've heard us talk about before within the care delivery businesses and such as value-based care that these are on. Most of the markets that we want to address are aren't established the way that we would like them to be established, so it's very greenfield in terms of our approach to M&A as we look at marketplaces and bringing together the capabilities that we would pursue. The environment itself that echo what Andrew previewed there, certainly a strong environment in terms of opportunity sets that we are seeing in the broad marketplace, in terms of the types of capabilities that are there, how they might fit within this enterprise and the potential.   I think you would expect us to see like where we've been focused. Certainly, over the last number of years, you've seen us do a lot of development as it relates to components of value-based care. And you know we define that very broadly now in terms of how we think about capabilities within value-based care to bring in new capabilities also and across all the other elements. But overall characterize the environment as strong and the opportunities is among some of the most interesting, I think, that we have seen as a company. Yes. I'd agree with that completely, John. And I certainly, over the next several years, see this part of the agenda being a key part of our continued support of our long-term growth goals, and you should expect to see us be -- continue to be active in the space. We'll take our next question from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. I wanted to follow up on the home component of the value-based care opportunity. Wondering if you'd say potentially you're further along in the penetration with the home model inside the UHC book than other payers? Any color there would be great. And then, any sense of how the 4 million fully accountable lives break out by clinic versus home model with the primary care setting, or also how the 750,000 member growth breaks out for 2023 would be great. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me just reiterate how important we see the development of the home model, the home care platform, and we've seen that grow very substantially over the last couple of years in particular.   Super important though, to recognize that it kind of -- so of course, sometimes folks can be essentially managed within just the home environment or the home care platform, and that certainly happens sometimes. But of course, what always happens, what very often happens is the clinic environment, the home environment are connected together, which is really what we're building here.   So it's not super instructive, I think, to think about folks who are just kind of clinic nominated or home nominated. That can happen. But not really, I think, necessarily the right way to look at it. I wouldn't look at it that way. I'd see -- I really think about it the way we've built the home capabilities as a substantial extension of what we're able to do in the clinical space.   And it speaks to the reality of care. People -- a lot -- not everything happens in the 20 minutes you're in the clinic, right? A ton of things happen when you're at home, and making sure that we've got care capabilities there, especially for folks who find it difficult to get out of the home or for whatever reason, find it difficult to engage with the system. That's a super important part of the environment. What I'd say is that, that is resonating super strongly, not just with UnitedHealthcare, but with other payers as well. And there's no doubt that this side of the agenda has caught the imagination of other payers, and we're delighted to see the continued extension of the multi-payer dynamic of OptumHealth and Optum more generally. And this is one of the drivers of that. In fact, during Q4, our external growth rate -- revenue growth rate was analogous to our internal growth, or i.e. Optum was growing just as quickly with non-UHC payers as it was with UHC. And that's a super important signal for the strength of the company. So important area, you'll continue to hear more about home as we go forward. But I would look at it more as a strengthening as a whole rather than a kind of separate stream in which we would be thinking about it that way. Hopefully, that helps a little bit, Stephen. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. The advance rate notice for '24 will be out in the coming weeks. It's clearly been well noted that the past few years have kind of been above the historical trend, and know that at some point we could see some moderation. I'd just be curious what your expectations are around that and how you view its relative importance in the context of your overall outlook for the MA market. Nathan, yes, as you rightly say, obviously, we're getting close to when we would likely hear the rate notification. And obviously, we don't know what that's going to be. I think where we would sit is -- we think MA is an incredibly important program for seniors. I think it's been demonstrated now repeatedly the value that delivers to the individuals, the value it delivers to society. And of course, the way in which seniors are essentially voting to become part of this program just signals how effective it is.   We believe that one of the key elements of that effectiveness that we certainly focused on is our ability to deliver stable benefits year in, year out. So I mean bottom line for us is we hope year in, year out, that the rate notice essentially facilitates that and it allows us to continue to deliver that stability. And we look forward to seeing what that will be, and we'll work with that once it's communicated to us. Not much more we can say on that, to be honest, until we obviously get the rate notice. So thanks for the question. Next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. On OptumRx, your near-term OptumRx targets do imply passing on the savings from biosimilars, but can you detail some of the other levers you have here to drive the strength you're anticipating? How should we rank those drivers across pharmacy services, versus biosimilar benefits over the next, let's say, 12 to 18 months? Great question, Erin. Before I ask Heather to give you a few more details, I think we're super pleased with the progress we've made, particularly on the biosimilar innovation that's coming this year in the next few weeks. And the work that's been done within OptumRx to deliver a contracting strategy, which ensures that everybody who wants to use a HUMIRA molecule, whether that's the brand or whether it's a biosimilar, gets access to lower cost right out of the gate has been a super important innovation in terms of our contracting strategy.  So without folks having to be shifted from drugs or dislocated in the marketplace, we found a way to bring lower cost to everybody in that environment. And I really want to give credit to Heather and her team for the work that she's done to lead on all of that. As you rightly say, we're passing those benefits directly back to the payers and the folks themselves.  And with that, Heather, why don't you pick up and describe what else is driving the Rx growth this year. Sure. So first, let me give you just another sense of maybe next phase when you think biosimilar and then let's hit the strength of the earnings for us in '23.  So as Andrew said, we intended to set up the biosimilar strategy to allow the most value to pull through in year 1 that we can to clients, and we're proud of that. But this is a multiyear strategy, and the markets dynamic will continue to watch it. What's important here is creating a marketplace for competition of the originator with a biosimilar in the specific unique environment with HUMIRA and so many manufacturers coming to market. But over a period of maybe, say, the next 18 months with different attributes, our strategy allows them to compete based on their clinical criteria and product attributes, how the manufacturer supports the product and then, obviously, the economics and the pricing. So that's the goal. We'll see that play out over the years. And the goal was to provide choice, not a lot of disruption and be able to extract value without restriction or exclusion. So we'll watch that play out. But when I think about the earnings and the strength of the position we're in or what we hoped to be by the end of '23, think of it as some of the stories you've heard us building and what we've been talking about for the last couple of years, and that's strengthen our pharmacy services.  I'll give you an example. Yes, the community pharmacies are growing. They're expanding quickly. But our specialty pharmacies, our frontier therapies where we serve some of the more rare disease and orphan drugs are growing as quickly. And in many of those are getting scale. So for instance, the community pharmacies are scaling to the point where we're allowed -- we have central fill supporting because we have the volume of scripts going to those community pharmacies.   And we're getting better with negotiations, we're able to negotiate harder on some of our procurement in those businesses. But also look at the PBM. You heard strong selling season again. We hope to have another strong selling season. The pricing is dynamic.  We moved quickly with our pricing, with our product attributes. Our product adoption is up 40% year-over-year in our PBM products.  And then we've got some return on some of the investments we made in the last year or two, Optum Frontier Therapies, our partnership with RVO. So that, I think, is when you look towards the next year, focus on those areas and look for us to drive earnings growth in those particular areas. Heather, well said. And again, you've seen a real transformation of the OptumRx platform. If you look at 5 years ago, about 1/3 of the revenues in that business came from non-PBM pharmacy services. Now it's at half. As a tremendous shift on the business' scale, really is significant.  And I'd say one of the key themes, which is driving a lot of that is a relentless shift was the consumer in the way in which that business is orientated and building its product. Real focus on delivering the best possible deal for consumers, making sure they get the lowest net cost. And then you'll see through, as Heather just mentioned, partnerships like RVO Health, you'll see us to continue to innovate the way in which we engage with consumers to make that much more modern, much more as U.S. consumers should get and should expect. The next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. So regarding the acuity level of the elevated flu and respiratory costs in the fourth quarter, is there any sense for just how much of the elevated cost for, hate to call it, triple-demic, let's just call it that, I guess, for the quarter, how much of that was related to the hospital inpatient setting in particular? And then from your data, was there any sense that there may have been any slightly lower elective procedures or traditional non-COVID and non-flu-related care in the fourth quarter in light of the elevated fluid and respiratory cost and utilization? Steven, thanks so much for asking that. Listen, I think -- listen, of course, it was Q4. There was a bit more flu and [indiscernible]. But really, I'd say immaterial in the scheme, in the grand -- in the way I'd say in the grand scheme of the health care costs of the U.S., almost not noticeable. I mean, almost nothing to see.  And I think I wouldn't -- much as I think there was a lot of anticipation around what could be coming in this notion of different viruses all come, somehow creating this, I think you said triple pandemic, really not there. And the little elevation we saw was somewhat within the ranges of what you typically would expect in a normal Q4 early flu season, which, as Brian mentioned earlier, looks like it's -- we've seen the last five  weeks coming down. That's pretty much it, yes.  So I really wouldn't guide you to characterize this as a big deal within the overall mix of the total health care costs that we're dealing with. It really isn't. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for redeterminations that you talked a bit about, how you see that as a membership opportunity, but some more focus on the MLR implications. I guess, if you think about the potentially significant change in the membership of the Medicaid program and the implications for the risk pool there, how are you thinking about potential margin compression and how quickly rates might be able to reflect that, if it does play out? Kevin, thanks so much. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who looks after our Medicaid business to talk to that. And maybe Tim, as you do that, you could also maybe just allude a little bit on the degree of visibility you have for your book of business as you roll into 2023. That might also be helpful. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Kevin, for the question. So certainly, a number of factors in play as we look ahead, certainly, the change in membership that we'll see as redeterminations resume. And then also acuity utilization, all of the factors really as things return to normal.  So at this point, from where we look, we've got visibility at around 75% of our revenue for the year. And states, as they set that revenue, have taken all of those factors into account when setting their rates, and that revenue is in line with our expectations and consistent with the outlook that we shared in November. So we're appreciative of the balanced rational view that our states have taken as they've looked ahead, knowing that we've got many factors coming forward.  Maybe one last thing, just as we look ahead, the redetermination process will be extended. We know it will take 10 to 12 months depending on the state. And that will give us opportunities to provide data, feedback and insights to our customers, work with them to adjust as things develop. So really no changes from what we communicated in November and with a little bit more certainty now in terms of our revenue. Right. Thank you, Tim. I appreciate that, Kevin. Thanks for the question. Operator, we just have time for one last question, if we could go ahead, please. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. I wanted to come back to the specialty drug and pharmacy initiatives. And I guess, can you talk about what percent of these drugs are going through the mail channel versus the retail channel now? Kind of how do you expect the share to shift away from retail to mail? And then I'd tack on kind of how should we think about what the earnings power of the shifts can look like as you capture more of the specialty drugs in owned channels versus third-party channels? George, thanks so much for the question. Let me hand straight to Heather, please. Sure, great question. As we continue to see the pipeline in specialty drugs, I hope you can feel the urgency around us driving. And you can see it in our growth, but also in our patient care and our clinical program. So our Optum Frontier Therapies, I think, is actually a good model. I know it serves only sort of rare disease and orphan drug, but we talked about the investor conference. It's got a comprehensive clinical model wrapping around it that supports not just the patients, the caregivers, the prescriber, the family, but also helps pharma to deliver the best service in those drugs. That is the model we're using to inform how we serve clients and how we serve patients in our specialty business as well. So think about that holistic patient advocacy, patient support, caregiver support, prescriber support, all while investing in automation. So even in our pharmacy, in our specialty pharmacy today, our automation is up. We're actually seeing over 30% higher self-service in the specialty pharmacy. That's not just mail and maintenance, that's specialty. So we're investing in the automation. For those that have simple transactions and want to interact with us with these, but those that need more comprehensive care with complex conditions that need the value of our 24/7 pharmacist support, our team is there to help them. So we will always continue to work with our retail partners. We are -- we've got a very strong network of that. But we want to be able to serve our consumers and our clients with best-in-class specialty service. Thanks, Heather. And George, thank you for the question. Listen, we come to the end of the call, I hope very much you leave the call with a sense of our optimism and focus on continued growth for the year ahead.  We remain intent on expanding our ability to help improve healthcare at the system and individual levels and executing with excellence for all those we serve. We look forward to sharing our progress on this journey with you again in April. And in the meantime, thank you so much for your attention this morning. We appreciate it. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back.  Starting on Page 1. The firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57, on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had 2 significant items in Corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment securities loss.  Touching on a few highlights. Combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year, with growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. We ended the year ranked at #1 for global IB fees with a wallet share of 8%, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company.  On Page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $8.4 billion or 72% driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower Auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up $382 million or 7% year-on-year.  Expenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm's macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case as well as loan growth in card services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty.  Looking at the full year results on Page 3. The firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%. On the balance sheet and capital on Page 4, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA.  RWA declined approximately $20 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business, which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in card services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached 1 quarter early. So given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.  Now let's go to our businesses, starting on Page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data.  Combined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year. E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat.  Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize, with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of this year.  Now moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-on-year. You'll notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates.  Deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships. Client investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows, where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customers. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower production revenue.   Moving to Card Services & Auto. Revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher card services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20%, and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And then Auto originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%. Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by Auto lease depreciation from lower volumes.  In terms of credit performance this quarter. Credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800 million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year.  Next, the CIB on Page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions, resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity.  In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook. Also note that it will be a difficult compare against last year's first quarter.  Moving to Markets. Revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12% as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in rates and currencies in emerging markets, while securitized products continue to be challenged by the market environment Equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year.  Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56%, and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels.  Expenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full year basis, expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation.  Moving to the Commercial Bank on Page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year. Deposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of nonoperating deposits. Loans were up 14% year-on-year and 3% sequentially.  C&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity.  Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on Page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pretax margin of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins and lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management and performance and placement fees linked to this year's market declines.  Expenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisor teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across equities and Fixed Income, and $47 billion for the full year.  And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by the rising rate environment, resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives.  Turning to Corporate on Page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the 2 significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year.  With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on Page 10, while I take a sip of water. Okay. We expect total NII to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023. Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late December, the hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the year should be a net tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumers.  In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall Card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances given modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale.  But it's very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed funds could deviate from forwards, balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different, and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and may be quite different from what this outlook assumes.  And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year. That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect sequential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII. As the guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates. But remember, this is offset in Markets NIR.   Now turning to expenses on Page 11. We expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers. We expect increases from labor inflation, which, while it seems to be abating on a forward-looking basis, is effectively in the run rate for 2023. An additional labor-related driver is the annualization of 2022 headcount growth as well as our plans for a modest headcount increase in the year, all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments.  And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it's a more modest increase than last year. The themes remain consistent, and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May.  Of course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while volume and revenue-related expense was ultimately a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market dependent, as always.  Moving to credit on Page 12. On the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the company across wholesale, Card and the rest of consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook, for Card net charge-off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this at our recent conference, and our outlook hasn't really changed. So to recap that story, the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future charge-offs. And it is currently around 80% of pre-pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of the year, with the associated charge-offs following about 6 months later. As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the historically low rate of 147 basis points in 2022, but still well below fully normalized levels.  So let's turn to Page 13 for a brief wrap-up before going to Q&A. We're very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTCE and record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my discussion of the outlook, I've emphasized the uncertainty in many of the key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performance. So as we look forward, we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near term, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through-the-cycle target of 17% ROTCE.  And with that, operator, let's open up the line for Q&A. [ Our first question ] is coming from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about the NII outlook, Slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide. As you mentioned, it looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? Maybe you could give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes. Sure, John. I mean I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that relatively small changes in deposit rate and paid for the company on average, as you well know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII.  And also that there's, as we've already talked about, a meaningful -- the outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says. And the drivers within that are the usual drivers in wholesale. We would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition, especially of the nonoperating type balances. And you're going to see some internal migration there out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing over time.  In Consumer, CDs are flowing right now, and we're seeing good new CD production. We've got a 4% CD in the market as of this morning. And so continued CD production and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it is -- well, of course, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect, across the company, modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT in the rate cycle and so on. So we've got the best guesses for all of those in the outlook. And of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another, and we'll just run the business this year. Okay. And on buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have? And any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks? Yes, sure. So sort of in the mode of like helping you guys out to put a number in the model, if you sort of look at the way we're seeing things, obviously, we've got another GSIB start coming next year. So say, 13.5% target. And the sort of using your estimates, organic capital generation, minus dividends, et cetera, and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion of buybacks for this year for 2023.  But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have better uses for the money, those will come first, and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion. And also noting that we are potentially going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter or maybe in the second quarter. And while that will be an NPR, it will only cover part of the surface area and it won't be final, so it's unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short-term decision-making. There will be some information content of that release that could shape our decisions as well. The next question is coming from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning. Appreciate that there is a significant amount of uncertainty in this year's NII forecast in particular. But to follow up with John's question, I'm wondering if you could give us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you're expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit beta.  I think the feedback I'm getting very early from investors is that they appreciate the headwinds that's occurring for NII this year. At the same time, you have been consistently beating what seems like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion number in the fourth quarter. So that's why I think the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their own expectations are versus that. Thanks, Erika. So look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we're trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year.  I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely. And that's just a level of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we'll be faced with as a company are -- respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with the strategy, which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits, as I said.  Jamie, on... Erika, thank you. I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider $74 billion conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in e-bills, money market funds. And of course, banks are competing for the cap of money now. And banks are all in different places. So some banks started competing heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less.  But if you look at prior -- and forget what happened in 2016. I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had queued -- these 0 rates. We've never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CD, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people are competing for it, and we're going to have to change saving rates. Now we can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen.  And I just also want to point out that even at $74 billion, we're earning quite good returns. And that's not -- and we've always pointed out to you that sometimes we're over earning and sometimes are under earning. But I would say, okay, this time we're over earning on NII this quarter. We're maybe over earning on credit. We maybe under earning in something else. So these are still very good numbers, and we're going to wait and see and we'll report to you, but I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is. And my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let's zoom out for a second here. To your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession. And I'm going to reask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day, even with the headwind in NII and the headwind on the provision? Yes, we can. But a lot of factors could turn that, but yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession, which I think even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company, which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns, and we can still grow.  And 17% is -- remember, 17% is very good if you compound -- some growth is 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I also want to point, we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point. And Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So as you know and as we discussed a lot, like through the pandemic in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist central case forecast, which is you correctly say is a mild recession, through the way we weighed the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective. So we just want to be clear about. The next question is coming from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I guess maybe, Jeremy, just following up on the credit assumptions underlying. If you could give us a sense of what's assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year, be it in terms of the unemployment rate and your outlook around, just a lot of chatter around commercial real estate, the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop. Are you concerned about that? Are you seeing pain points in CRE customers given what's happening with cap rates? And then just the overall backdrop today. Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multifamily commercial term lending business is really quite different from the classic office type business. Our office portfolio is very small, Class A, best developers, best locations. So the vast majority of the loan balances in commercial real estate are that sort of affordable multifamily housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business.  And so yes, so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So yes, as I said, like the central case economic forecast has a mild recession, and if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect a slightly more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment that's notably higher than that.  So I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the trajectory that we've talked about in the presentation, they're definitely -- can capture something more than a very mild soft lending. But of course, it wouldn't be appropriate to reflect a full-blown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%. Noted. And I guess just as a follow-up on you've managed RWA growth pretty well when you look at like loan growth year-over-year versus RWA, stayed relatively flat. As we think about just managing capital, how should we think about the evolution of RWA? Are there still opportunities to optimize that going into whatever the Fed comes out with on Basel? Yes. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We're continuing to work very hard, and it's a big area of focus. Some of that is reflected in this quarter's numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items, particularly in market risk RWA. And yes, but we should be clear that although we've said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material economic headwind for the company, they're also not 0. There are real consequences due to the choices that we're making as a result of this capital environment.  And in a Basel III outcome, that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective. There will be additional consequences to that. We obviously are hoping that's not the case and believe that it's not appropriate, but we'll see what happens. The next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. I'm curious, I want to talk levered loans for a second. You've done a good job avoiding some of these -- put on these loans for the like the better half of the last half year. So good call on your part. Things have gotten a lot cheaper. However, bank balance sheets, not yours, are still kind of mucked up with a lot of the back book. I'm curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough. Do you consider yourself back in? And how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up to have available funding from the big banks? Yes. A couple of things there, Glenn. So short answer is we're absolutely open for business there. Terms are better, pricing is better. We have the resources needed. We're fully, fully there. No overhang and no issue.  Also, I think there's a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang. We're not convinced that, that's true. We think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forward and the system has the capacity to handle the risks. So I recognize your point. I think it's an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the perspective of bank's ability to finance activity. Interesting. So maybe a bit [ lasting ], more so. Okay. Maybe, Jamie, while we have you. In the last annual letter, you talked about low competitive moats and intense competition from all angles, not just fintech. And I was just trying to think out loud. Is that better or worse, that competitive landscape in a much higher rate backdrop? Maybe I'll just leave it at that for you to see where you go with it. I think it's the same. You have the Apples, who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmart starting theirs. And obviously, higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fintech world and maybe even help some folks. So we expect tough competition going forward. The next question is coming from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Jeremy, you mentioned in your payments business that if you took out the equity investment write-downs, the growth was over 50%. Can you share with us on the equity write-downs -- obviously, private equity is going through some challenging times. And I'm assuming that... It was a gain last year. It wasn't a write-down this year. I got it. Okay. I thought there was a write-down there. Okay. Let me make that clear. Sorry about that. Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Can you -- sticking just with private equity for a moment, can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity markets to JPMorgan? Is there -- when you think about it from your loan book, or is it really just an equity investments? And maybe expand upon that. Sorry, do you want me to take that? Yes, this is a couple of things. So Jamie is right. The headwind year-on-year is primarily a function of the fact that this is an investment that just because of the measurement alternative accounting standard, we were forced to mark up previously. This is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives. So anyway, it's fine.  The point is there is a small write-down this quarter. And the important point there is that the core business performing exceptionally well, both because of higher rates, but also because of the strategy that Takis talked a lot over at Investor Day paying off across fees and value-added services and so on and so forth. And I guess throughout your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space? Did I hear that correctly? That's correct, Jeremy. And just in terms of any lending, obviously, so many of these companies have seen their valuations come down considerably. Is there any elevated risk lending to some of these companies considering the struggles they're having? Yes. I mean I think that's a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company. Our exposures to the sort of non-bank financial sector are probably defined. And of course, as -- we thought a little bit about what normalized wholesale charge-offs could look like through the cycle. They're obviously higher than effectively 0, which is what we have now. But we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the books. Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter. Two questions to that. First, the Shared National Credit exam results are always released in February. Does the reserve buildup takes some of that into account? And second, how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case, the quantitative part of the decision-making for building up the reserve. Yes. I mean I'll give you that answer, but I'm oversimplifying a lot. I would say that... Over simplify. Yes, yes, I know. I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change, for all intents and purposes, quarter-on-quarter. I think that's the best way to think about that, Gerard. And then shared national -- yes, go ahead. The National Shared Credit thing will not affect our results materially. The next question is coming from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the RWAs in advance of all the points we've made already about the pending capital regime. How do we -- can you help us understand what type of effects that has, if any, on parts of the income statement, whether it's NII or the trading business? Yes. So if I just take that one. Just assume we're going to have modest growth in RWA. And in every single businesses, mortgages, loans, derivatives, how we hedge CVA and stuff like that, we take access to manage RWA. Do not -- it does not really affect the business that much. It might one day, but it doesn't affect it today. And so we don't build in somehow we lose a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  And there -- and the biggest opportunity down the road will be a reopening in the securitization markets. And they're still very tight. And I think one day, they will reopen. Okay. And then on the -- one follow-up, just coming back to the reserving process. Can you just help us understand relative to the 5% peak in 3Q that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average in the 3.9 average baseline, just where does this fourth quarter reserve get you to? And does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarter still stand in terms of scenario analysis on potential builds ahead of this mild recession? Can I just make it real simple? The base case, okay, is where it hits almost that 5% unemployment. Then you probability weight other scenarios. That's why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn't change the probabilities in our weighting. But of course, it got worse and the base case got worse. That's all it is, which still is a good benchmark, you'll keep in mind, is if we got to a relative adverse case, all that, a 6% unemployment, we -- and then once you get there, you assume the average weighting, you have wins. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more.  When the base case itself deteriorates, we're moving closer to relative adverse, that's all it is. These are all probabilities and possibilities and hypothetical numbers. And if I were you, I'd just look at charge-offs, like actual results. And so -- and we break this out, but it's hard to describe, and every bank does it slightly differently, and every bank has a slightly different base case and slightly different weighting of adverse cases, et cetera. And so we're just trying to make it as simple as possible. Yes, I hear you. The challenge this time is that we're going to have the income statement effect way ahead of that charge-off. So we're all trying to just fit for that. But I appreciate that. Thanks, Jamie. And once the -- any base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, you'd be adding to $6 billion of reserves before you have charge-offs. Exactly. Right. Ken, maybe just out of interest. Implied in your question might be a little bit, to what extent does this quarter's build sort of is a down payment on the $6 billion? And the answer to that question is much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven by loan growth, but in some of it, as Jamie says, is driven by the flow-through of the downward provision in the central case. You could say, subject to the caveat that this is a little bit or not science, that there's some down payment on that $6 billion. The next question is coming from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. I wanted to understand a little bit about how you're thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked already about how it's hard to predict NII. Obviously, markets has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about delivering operating leverage, where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested in so you really can't touch? And where there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker rev line, you can still deliver positive operating leverage? Sure. So I mean, as we -- as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our 3 categories. And in some sense, the category that you're addressing is the volume and revenue-related expense, which we highlight because it should pretty symmetrically respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage.  So for example, in this year's ultimate outcome, and the number that we want on printing for 2022, the year-on-year change in volume and revenue-related expense, still refining the numbers, we'll probably show you more at the Investor Day, but it's probably close to $1 billion. In other words, year-on-year decline. Whereas next year, we're assuming something more like flat. So while the sort of year-on-year dollar change in the outlook, sort of '21 to '22, '22 to '23 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually.  And so for example, if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that we're budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop in the volume and [ revenue-related ] expense number that's in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage.  For the rest of it, we're always generating efficiency. And we've worked just as hard at that, whether the revenue environment is good or bad. And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so broadly, our investment plans really should be that sensitive to short-term changes in the environment.  Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the Card business, in particular, the math of what we expect the NPV of those things to be in the cycle may change in a downturn. And that could produce lower investment, all else equal. But the core strategic investments that we're making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of both the environment in... Okay. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan stock has been around the capital charges, the capital march, and will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years? As you deliver on the positive operating leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital obviously and still hit those IRR and ROTCE targets on incremental investments.  Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you're expecting to generate? And maybe that's an unfair question today, and it's a better question for Investor Day, but that's kind of the debate that's out there on the stock. I got it. I mean it's a fair question. It's a good question. I'm not going to answer it super specifically. And Jamie may have some views there, too. But let me just quickly say, we've kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company's ability to generate 17% in the cycle. And that's incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of '24.  The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is, of course, impossible to answer right now. But I would remind you that it's not just denominator expansion, unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy, which goes into the numerator, too. It's not what we want, but that is a possible outcome. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. I recognize you're evolving your business model and you're spending money to make more money and that your track record last decade was strong there. But as it relates to the Frank acquisition that's been in the news, I'm just wondering what that says about the financial discipline for the 15 deals that you pursued, the $7 billion of investing each year and the 1/5 increase in expenses over 3 years to your guide of $81 billion in 2023. So it's really a question about financial discipline. And I know you can't go in details on the Frank deal. And look, you earn the purchase price in 2 days, okay? So I get that. And if there's fraud, there's only -- you can't do anything about fraud, but still, it's diverse management resources and attention.  So maybe just in the specifics as it relates to the acquisition strategy, like who sources them? Who negotiates them? Who does the due diligence? Who runs it? And ultimately, who's accountable for all these 15 different deals? And when you have investments going across business lines, which is a strength of you guys, but who's ultimately accountable when these investments don't go the way you want to?  And Jamie, you recognized, a couple of years ago at Investor Day, you said, \"Look, sometimes you're going to waste money as you're innovating and you're growing.\" But ultimately, who's accountable when investment doesn't go right, like the Frank deal or another deal or some of the other $81 billion that you expect to spend this year? Obviously, Mike, that's a very good question, which we're always concerned at. We've always talked about complacency and all things like that. So obviously, when you're getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to make -- have errors. And we don't want our company to be terrified of errors that we don't do anything and that the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy, which is stasis and [ death ]. So you have to be very careful when you make an error like you cripple the firm.  We are very disciplined, and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see it in our leverage lending book, you see it in the success of our investments, you see it in the quality of our products and services, you see it in our -- in all these things. And it's no different for an acquisition.  There are -- so the acquisitions are done by the businesses but it's also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So the business does it, the centralized team does it. We've been doing it for 20 years, it's not like we just started doing something like that. And obviously, there are always lessons learned.  And at one point, we'll tell you the lessons learned here when this thing is out of litigation. But we're quite comfortable. And the people who are responsible are the people in the business. So they -- that business did the acquisition, they are responsible, they report back. And we expect people, when they talk to all of us, is the good, the bad, the ugly. We're never looking for how great everything was. And obviously, this thing in one way or another, it was a huge mistake. Let me follow up on that. So that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth, such as in the Payments business, which I know is a focus that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So as you invest more in Payments, which is -- can be a 20 or 30 PE business, which could be great if you got there, who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? Sometimes, when you aggregate the data, it's consumer, it's the investment bank, it could be asset management, it could be commercial, it could be everything in the Payments. Who's responsible for those? So just to be clarified. So I would say that Marianne and Jen, when it comes to credit, debit, checks and all the consumer-related stuff; and Takis, which I think you saw in the presentation about payments at Investor Day, reporting to Daniel, and that is on the wholesale payments, merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff. And those are direct responsibilities. It's quite clear, this is an area that cuts across the company. So it's a payments working group that just spends time on that.  That working group has not done an acquisition, okay? And if they make -- if they want to invest, which there are cases, by the way, which you -- and you'll see more this year, we decided jointly and all the way up to Daniel and me. And then last follow-up to my first start, the general comment. I mean this is the third year in a row of about $5 billion of expense growth, and you have Slide 11 there. But -- I mean, that's a lot of certain front-loaded expenses for less certain back-ended benefits. How is your comfort level that you're going to see those back-ended benefits relative to the past? Totally. And we tried to show you guys at Investor Day, every branch we open, for every bank that we hire, for every tech thing we do, we're pretty comfortable. There are certain things that's more like infrastructure, like getting to the cloud, stuff like that, which you can't identify all of that. But we're pretty comfortable that we -- if they weren't working, we change them.  So we ask ourselves that question every day with adding wealth managers or branches or certain things, so -- and marketing is half of that -- not quite half but half that number. That's a very specific -- for the most part, very specific dollar in, how many dollars out. It's not a guess, and we're pretty accurate at that kind of stuff. And again, if we -- if there's $1 billion that we were spending that didn't give us the return, we'd cut the $1 billion. Next question is coming from the line of Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. So I wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for trading in the Investment Banking businesses. Just Jeremy, given the strong pipelines you cited, I was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what you're hearing from corporate clients, especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined, when you would expect to see some inflection in Investment Banking activity. And similar question on the trading side. You're facing difficult comps in the coming year. We still have QT, rate volatility proxy still elevated. Do you anticipate a significant moderation in trading activity or not? Sure. Thanks, Steve. So let's do banking first. So I think the thing that's interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so significant, obviously, from very elevated levels. But even relative to just 2019, 2022 was a relatively weak year.  And as we look into 2023, it's possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in [ 2022 ]. That could conceivably make you pessimistic about the Investment Banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it's not as if we're super optimistic. But it's important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things change in 2022, specifically with respect to rates as that affects the debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and DCM as well.  And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuations in the open market. So I think there's a chance that, that actually winds up helping in 2023 in the Investment Banking world. Of course, we don't know. But those are some of the things that we're thinking about.  Similarly, on the Markets side, obviously, markets had another very strong year, better than we'd expected since the numbers were so strong coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw. And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continuing markets.  As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious, and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, it's not like the volatility is going away. And Markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And 4.5%, 5% rate environment is probably one where there's more trading opportunities than the 0% rate environment.  So of course, we don't know. We'll see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. It's -- the numbers are really very strong in Markets, but we'll see, we'll see what happens. That's really helpful color. And just for my follow-up on finalization of Basel III. Sorry, Jeremy, I couldn't help myself here. But in [ Bar's ] December speech, you strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers. You also alluded in your comments or in response to one of the questions that the finalization of Basel III can potentially be very punitive.  Given the absence of the proposal, I was really just hoping you could speak to how your scenario planning for the eventual finalization and any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation. I think the one issue or area of confusion is that one of the biggest sources of RWA inflation is op risk, which can't really be mitigated. So what are the actions that you can take to really offset some of those potential headwinds? Yes. So Steve, I'd love to get into detail here, but I just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. And the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases, I mean, you studied this issue closely, it's just to point out that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing, it's a very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, that just like doesn't make sense to us.  So we just want to say that. But yes, Jamie, please. Just, look, you guys know that the operators' capital, the trading book, the CCAR, G-SIFI, all those moving parts, let's just see what they are. We'll deal with them when we get there. And then we'll figure out what we have to modify in our business and stuff like that. We don't think it's necessary to increase capital ratio. We're quite clear on that.  One of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our total loss-absorbing capacity. So we have now almost $500 billion. I mean really, like at one point, when is $500 billion of that, $1 trillion liquidity, all those thing's enough. And so -- but let's just see what it is. They're going to work it through their international laws, their international requirements. We're hoping that America is the same as international. That would be nice. G-SIFI is supposed to be corrected. We'll see if that happens. So let's just see. We don't have to guess. And if the number's too high, we're going to tell you what we're going to do about it. Just a minor expansion on that, just to expand a bit on Jamie's point, that -- it's important to be clear. There will be time to adjust. Like there's a long road from the NPR to -- so to sort of supports Jamie's point, let's see what it is and then we'll... The next question is coming from the line of Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. How do you guys think of the managing of the securities book, given the outlook of lower deposit? Obviously, the yield curve is quite inverted depending on what part you're looking at or most part, frankly. And at the same time, the securities book is cash flowing a lot less than it was a couple of years ago just given the rate environment. Yes. So remember, the securities book is an outcome of investing, but basically excess deposits. And you have like $2.4 trillion deposits and $1 trillion of loans and things like that. So -- and we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things. And so -- and then when you say the size of it, we forecast -- which I'm not going to give you the numbers, we forecast every quarter, what we're going to buy, what we're going to sell, how much is coming in, how much we need for liquidity, and we adjust it all the time based upon deposits coming down and loans and stuff like that.  Obviously, what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today. And you see JPMorgan's loss in ACM loan book as a percentage is much lower than most other people. We're kind of conservative there, too. I guess a bigger picture question. We've seen such a drop in really 5- to 10-year part of the curve and even further out. And banks aren't really buying, as said, they're selling. And I guess I was wondering if you had thoughts on who's buying and what's driving the rates so much lower than most people thought they should be at. Yes, we do. But we should really get the answer, of course, to get that. We look at what everybody is doing, pension plans, governments. We look at every part of the curve. We look at what other banks are doing. I think I mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different positions. Some may have to sell securities to finance their loan books. We obviously don't.  So people are in a different position. And as Jeremy pointed out, it's very important. That yield curve will not be the same 6 months from now than is today. While we use that to kind of look forward, it's not actually our forecast. We know it will be wrong. And with the investment portfolio, we'd be invested where there are opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there was a 60 OAS spread. We sold -- one of the reasons we take securities losses, that gives you $10-plus billion you can reinvest it when you think of more attractive securities. The final question is coming from the line of Andrew Lim from Societe Generale. So the first one on credit quality, thanks for giving us commentary on the shape of NCOs, I guess, specifically for credit cards topping out at the end of this year. Could you give us a bit more color on how reserve builds should shape out this year, I guess, with respect to CECL? I'm guessing that it should top out quite soon. That's my first question, Just assuming all your macro assumptions are unchanged and -- all the macro assumptions are unchanged... Andrew, well, I think we've talked about CECL like quite a bit, and I think there's some decent color there in terms of Jamie's $6 billion over a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We're definitely not going to get into the business of giving you an outlook for sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance. But it's appropriate today and it will evolve as a function of the environment. Sure. Okay. Let's drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So if I heard you correctly, I think you're still talking about sequential increases in NII, so I guess, looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe even 2Q. So I guess we're hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop off as, say, deposit cost increase and maybe we get a few Fed fund rate cuts as well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it? Yes, no. So let me uncontroversially say no there, Andrew, just really avoid some doubts. So my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which you are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that in a world where we're exiting the fourth quarter run rate at [ 81 ], and we're telling our ADX markets or whatever, we're telling you 74 for the full year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We're simply saying don't project those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense? Right. Got you. Yes. No, no, no, sure. Absolutely, that makes sense. That's great. We have no additional questions in queue. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Barnum. That's it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you all soon. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time."

         "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines December Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I will be your coordinator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Matthew, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our December quarter and full-year 2022 earnings call. Joining us from Atlanta today, our CEO, Ed Bastian; our President, Glen Hauenstein; our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta's performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet.  After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta's SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. You can find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.   And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ed. Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.  Earlier, Delta reported our full-year results, including our December quarter earnings per share of $1.48 on record revenue that was 8% above 2019 levels. We generated a 12% operating margin, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating margins, pointing to the strength of our recovery. I want to sincerely thank the 90,000-strong Delta team for their outstanding work in delivering these results and serving our customers during a very busy holiday travel season.  In my opinion, 2022 was the most difficult operational year in our history and was capped off by severe winter storms over the holidays. I am grateful to our employees for their great work to recover the operation, while keeping our customers and each other safe. They are the reason our brand and customer loyalty is at the top of the industry.  Our December quarter earnings per share and margins exceeded guidance, marking a strong close to a year where we made significant progress regarding restoration of our financial foundation. For the full year, we reported earnings of $3.20 per share on $46 billion of revenue. We delivered pretax income of $2.7 billion, an improvement of more than $6 billion over 2021. Delta's profitability led the industry. And in our nearly 100-year history, 2022 was our seventh-highest result, even with a $1 billion loss in the first quarter. We are pleased to report positive free cash flow for the year, which funded $6 billion of capital invested back into the business. And we repaid close to $5 billion in gross debt. Sharing our success is a long-standing pillar of Delta's culture, and I'm proud to announce that we'll be paying our employees $550 million in well-earned profit-sharing coming Valentine's Day. 2022 came in ahead of our plan on revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating strong execution in the first year of the 3-year plan we laid out at the 2021 Capital Markets Day. I'm incredibly proud of the team for rebuilding the world's best-performing airline. And importantly, we're not just building back, we're continuing to improve and extend our competitive advantages.  Delta's brand continued to strengthen in 2022, with record performance from our loyalty and co-brand card programs and customer satisfaction scores consistently perform above pre-pandemic levels. Through the year, we've hired and trained 25,000 new employees, now representing over 1/4 of the total company. Our team showed their operating talent and resilience as we retained our #1 position in completion factor and on-time arrivals amongst our peer set, despite having so many new team members.  The Delta brand is centered on our safe, reliable and exceptional service. And our operational excellence was recognized by Cirium last week, which named us, yet again, the most on-time airline in North America. We fortified our international partnerships in 2022, positioning us for profitable international growth in the years ahead. As detailed last month, expanding our international margins to domestic levels is an important opportunity for Delta in the years to come.  We've invested in the customer experience at every stage of the travel journey, from the continued refresh of our fleet with next-generation far more fuel-efficient aircraft to generational airport rebuilds and technology investments that are providing our employees better tools and our customers a more seamless experience. And we continue to attract and partner with leading brands to grow our SkyMiles ecosystem and further enable customers to use their SkyMiles during travel and beyond.   Heading into 2023, our momentum continues. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas just last week, we unveiled the next phase in our vision to connect the Sky. Starting February 1, Delta will be the first major U.S. airline to provide fast, free, unlimited WiFi to all through its free SkyMiles account. This will be available on nearly 80% of our U.S. system to start and growing every week. By the end of next year, we expect to deliver this service seamlessly throughout the rest of our international and regional fleets.  And we debuted Delta Sync, which will create personalized experiences and engagement opportunities on the free WiFi portal. We're partnering with great brands like T-Mobile and Paramount+ as well as building on our long-standing relationship with American Express to bring to life our vision of a more connected and personalized travel experience. As a trusted consumer brand, Delta continues to differentiate the premium flying experience, building loyalty and supporting our ambition to transcend the industry. Moving to our outlook. At our investor event last month, we provided full-year 2023 guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion. We're affirming that guidance today and introducing our March quarter outlook, which Glen and Dan will provide in detail. For the March quarter, we expect to deliver a 4% to 6% operating margin and improve our pretax income by more than $1 billion compared to the same period last year. Importantly, we are embedding the assumed impact of all labor cost increases throughout our guidance metrics. We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with our pilots, but out of respect for the process, we will not be discussing the details of the agreement on today's call.  As I outlined last month, I've never seen a more constructive backdrop for the industry. Demand remains strong as passengers return to the skies and industry returns to the long-term trend to GDP, all while supply constraints continue. I believe our industry will see tens of billions of dollars of incremental demand in the next few years coming out of the pandemic.  As the industry leader with a proven strategy and strong execution track record, Delta is well-positioned to build on our momentum in the new year. We're confident in our ability to deliver significant improvement in earnings and free cash flow in 2023, consistent with the plan we laid out last month, and we are on track to deliver our 2024 targets of more than $7 of earnings per share and $4 billion of free cash flow. As always, we remain mindful of the macroeconomic trends and have demonstrated that we have the tools to effectively manage a changing economic climate.  In closing, Delta delivered in 2022, outperforming our plan and leading the industry operationally and financially. We are uniquely positioned to grow earnings and cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. The power of our premium brand continues to grow. And with the very best people in the industry, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for Delta and our customers.  Thank you again. With that, I'll turn it over to Glen. Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I couldn't be prouder of what the Delta people accomplished throughout 2022, and I want to congratulate our teams on their much deserved profit-sharing payout they'll be receiving next month.  For the full year, we generated revenue of $46 billion, a $19 billion improvement year-over-year. We delivered record December quarter and full-year unit revenues, sustaining our revenue premium to the industry of more than 110%. For the 12th consecutive year, Delta was named the #1 corporate airline in Business Travel News survey, as we continue to invest in our network and product offerings.  And through the year, we made significant progress on our long-term commercial strategy to deepen our network advantages, expand premium revenues, grow our loyalty ecosystem and further diversify our revenues.  Starting with our network strategy, we focused on solidifying our positions in coastal gateways, while protecting our core hub shares. We secured the leading positions in both Boston and Los Angeles, while increasing local market share in our core hubs.  Premium let all year with paid load factors higher than 2019 and yield growth outpacing Main Cabin, while basic economy made up less than 5% of revenue, half of the 2019 levels. We expanded our Delta Premium Select rollout during the year. Customer response has been positive and the cabin performed better than our initial expectations. Our rollout continues in 2023, and we will have this product on 84% of our international wide-body fleet by this summer. Our loyalty program continued to exceed our expectations with record SkyMiles acquisitions in 2022, 42% higher than 2019. As Ed noted, we're partnering with leading companies to expand our loyalty ecosystem, increasing the value of our program for customers and deepening customer engagement with Delta.  With an expanding ecosystem and free, fast WiFi, we expect continued growth in our loyalty base. Our partnership with American Express delivered record results, with full-year remuneration of $5.5 billion, ahead of our initial target and positioning us to deliver over $6.5 billion in 2023 and over $7 billion in 2024. Cargo revenue was a record in 2022, and we expect to grow cargo revenues in '23 as increased capacity offsets the cargo yield environment. With strong execution across our business lines, a record 55% of revenue was generated by premium products and diverse revenue streams. We're confident in our path to exceed 60% by 2024. While not without challenges, 2022 was a strong year for Delta, and we exited the year with momentum.  During the December quarter, we generated revenue of $12.3 billion, 8% higher than 2019, on 9% less capacity. We saw revenue recapture at the end of December that offset the impact of weather disruptions in our system around Christmas. Fourth quarter unit revenues were 19% higher than 2019, with strength driven by consumer demand throughout the quarter. Corporate travel demand was steady through the quarter, with corporate domestic sales 80% recovered to 2019 levels. We expect March quarter revenue to be up 14% to 17% higher versus 2019. On capacity approaching full restoration, we expect March quarter unit revenues will be up 15% to 17% compared to 2019, including a 2-point impact from higher stage. Based on how we're deploying our network, our stage length is expected to be up 5 points compared to 2019, resulting in a higher restoration of ASMs seats. This is a temporary dynamic that is unique to Delta among major carriers. Stage will begin to normalize relative to 2019 and relative to the industry as we rebuild our core hubs later this year.   For 2023, we expect to grow revenue 15% to 20% year-over-year as we fully restore our network and further diversify our revenue streams. Consumer demand remains healthy, with advanced bookings significantly ahead on both yield and load factor for each month of the March quarter compared to 2019. And in our recent corporate survey, results were positive with 96% of respondents expecting to travel as much or more in 1Q than 4Q, led by financial services.  In the new year, bookings reflect the survey optimism and are accelerating. International revenue continues to be led by the transatlantic. We are seeing robust demand across our expanded footprint in Europe and expect the spring and summer to set new record revenues. Latin America is performing very well, led by Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America, with a recovery in Deep South America now accelerating. And we are pleased with the early results from the launch of the LATAM JV, and I'm excited about the opportunities for us in 2023 and beyond. In the Pacific, we expected record first quarter profits in both Australia and Korea as our multiyear international transformation delivers on anticipated results. Japan is also building momentum, and we expect a very strong summer there. And lastly, with China, indicating its reopening, we expect to rebuild capacity in line with demand starting later this year. In closing, we delivered on our key commercial priorities in 2022, supporting a significant improvement in our revenue, while strengthening our competitive advantages. We have started the new year with great momentum and are well-positioned to extend our leadership position in the years ahead.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about the financials. Thank you, Glen. In 2022, we made significant progress restoring our financial foundation. We delivered earnings of $3.20 per share, with pretax income of $2.7 billion, ahead of our plan. Operating margins of 7.8% was driven by 3 quarters of double-digit margins. We improved profitability and a strong advanced bookings. We generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow, enabling continued investment in our people, our fleet, our partners and technology.  After gross CapEx of $6 billion, we generated $244 million of free cash flow. We ended the year with liquidity of $9.4 billion and adjusted net debt of $22.3 billion. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 5x, and our after-tax return on invested capital was 8.4%.  We finished the year strong, reporting a $1.4 billion operating profit on a margin of 11.6% for the December quarter. Our nonfuel costs were 13.4% higher than 2019, in line with guidance, excluding a 1-point impact from the severe winter weather in late December.  Now moving to guidance. As Ed mentioned, we are including all expected labor rate increases in our guidance metrics, including nonfuel CASM. As it relates to our pilots, if they vote to ratify the proposed agreement by March 1, pay rates would be retroactive to January 1. This results in a 3-point impact on our nonfuel unit costs for the year and in each of the quarters.  Including this in the full year guidance we gave last month, brings our 2023 non-fuel unit decline to 2% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Delivering a competitive cost structure is a key financial priority. Delta has led the industry an investment in our people and our customers, and this is embedded in our outlook, as is a full reset of regional costs and inflation. As we move through the year, scale and efficiency will drive a decline in 2023 nonfuel CASM versus 2022. While approaching 2019 capacity provides scale benefits, we are still bearing the cost to fully restore our network to the peak summer levels, with a continued emphasis on operational reliability during this ramp-up. We expect to complete our rebuild by the second half, with the majority of our flex fleet reactivated and training levels for our pilots reverting to historical levels. This will allow a significant shift of resources from training to production, giving us the confidence in our ability to deliver a fully restored network during the peak summer period, while enabling our operating teams to drive efficiency in the back half of the year.  One unique item within the year is the pacing of our core maintenance as we prepare to step up the network for summer flying with the first half year-over-year higher than -- and then lower in the second half of the year. While these dynamics impacting early part of the year, we expect 1Q nonfuel unit cost to increase 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis.  We expect the year-over-year unit cost to progressively improve through 2023 as we complete our rebuild and elevated maintenance activity, while driving efficiency across our operating groups. This cadence is consistent with our full year outlook for nonfuel unit cost to decline 2% to 4% year-over-year. With our outlook for revenue, we expect the March quarter operating margins to be 4% to 6% and earnings of $0.15 to $0.40 per share. For the full year, we are regulating our outlook for earnings of $5 to $6 per share and operating margins of 10% to 12%, delivering a 2- to 4-point expansion of margins, including over 1-point impact from higher profit sharing. We expect the full year free cash flow to be more than $2 billion, with gross CapEx of $5.5 billion. In 2023, nonoperating expense is expected to be $470 million higher year-over-year. This results from noncash pension expense increasing over $550 million year-over-year due to broad market declines, more than offsetting the reduction in interest expense from repaying debt. We plan to pay cash for our $2.4 billion in debt maturities, while opportunistically reducing debt with excess liquidity. So we'll bring our leverage to 3 to 3.5x target for 2023 and remaining on track for 2024 adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to be 2x to 3x. Returning to investment-grade metrics by 2024, while continuing to reinvest in the business remains our focus for capital allocation. In closing, I want to thank -- add my thanks to the Delta team and people for their hard work this year. We outperformed the first year of our 3-year plan, and we entered 2023 on track to generate a significant improvement in both earnings and cash flow. We remain confident in delivering on our 2024 target of $7 of earnings per share and generating over $4 billion of free cash flow. With that, I'll turn it over back to Julie for our Q&A. Thanks, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to queue up for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. So maybe I'll start with a question on the capacity bottlenecks that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Ed. So I know Delta itself has made a lot of progress in hiring and getting through a large wave of training, but there are other constraints outside of the airline industry's control with aircraft delivery slower than planned and aviation infrastructure still fairly strapped at airports and the FAA. Now I know the answer will be different for Delta than some of your peers who are further behind in their pilot hiring. But how do you think about the time line to remove some of these bottlenecks across the industry that aren't directly in airlines' control? And I guess really what I'm asking is, do you expect there to be continued tension between supply and demand over the medium term? Just how do you think about those rolling off? Thanks, Catie, and welcome back. Yes, I think you summed it up well. And I mentioned at the Capital Markets Day last month that while we -- at Delta, and I think the industry broadly provides you, our capacity expectations, I think expectations have quotation marks around them. And they do feel still a little bit more aspirational than -- because there are a number of things that are outside of our control.  We're doing our very best to get our people in place. The hiring is strong. We have the team assembled. We need to get them through, principally our pilots through the training, the limited training devices and school house that we have available to us. We expect by the summer that we will be in position to have not just get through most of that bottleneck, but then the large resource drain that it takes with respect to all of the training that are existing team has to do to train our new employees, whether that's pilots or flight attendants, mechanics, the airports, reservations. It doesn't matter where in the system you sit. That's hard to see. I can appreciate that if you're sitting in your chair, but it's very meaningful here on the airline. And then by summer, we hope, at Delta, that we'll be able to be back 100%. I also use the term fragile last month when speaking about the aviation system as we continue to return to the skies. And I think we've seen, just in the last few weeks, a couple of illustrations of that fragility.  So we're going to continue to do our best to make sure we don't fly in excess of our capabilities so that we can deliver a great product for our customers and provide all the tools and support for our employees. That's great. So helpful, Ed. And if I could maybe just for my follow-up, Glen, I know 75% of this year's growth by your core hubs. Can you help us think about RASM performance at your core hubs versus the rest of your network or even better since we know it's lower cost capacity? Can you help us think about the margin differential of adding capacity in core hubs versus competitive coastal hubs? Sure. I think we outlined that at the Investor Day and core hub is about 10 points higher than coastal hubs, and 10 points in margin and about 20 points in terms of RASM.  And I think as we continue to build our core hubs out, we will see -- that's one of the things we're counting on is acceleration of profitability in those core hubs and driving efficiency through getting them back to scale. As we mentioned in our Investor Day, we are already at scale in our coastal cities. That was our priority just because we thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity during the pandemic. And so that was our priority to ensure that we came out in a good position there. I think we're very happy with the positions we've established there, and now it's back to the core where we think it's actually easier lifting. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Ed, you said in your prepared remarks that you've never seen a more constructive industry backdrop. Black Swan event aside, what do you see are probably the biggest risks or things to watch out for the industry in 2023? Is it your previous response on kind of infrastructure and things that's outside of your control? Or kind of what are you looking at? Well, thanks, Ravi. I -- that's right. I think the most important thing that Delta we can do is to continue to restore confidence back to the traveling public. We know the traveling -- the public wants to travel in outsized amounts that we see continuing, and we have to do our very best not to disappoint them as they return to the skies. I think 2022 was very difficult. In that regard, demand clearly exceeded our ability to supply it for lots of ways, including in the service levels with the exceptional degree of service that we want to provide our customers. And I think we all in the industry owe it to our customers to make sure we don't fly in excess of our capabilities. So I think that's the single biggest thing that we all need to pay attention to. And so I wouldn't call it a black swan risk other than just trying to stay within our capability. Understood. And maybe as a follow-up, maybe for Glen. Can you just unpack your thoughts on corporate in the near term, a little bit more? I think that's obviously one of the big focus areas for investors right now.  You said 96% of corporate in your survey say that they're going to be kind of flat to up in the near term, but obviously, macro is really choppy. We saw some of the hotel data kind of, coming into January, take a bit of a step down. What are you seeing in terms of your booking curve? Kind of any signs at all on cracks and corporate demand given where macro is? We've had our highest post-pandemic days in terms of corporate booking over the last week or 10 days. So we see a very strong post-holiday demand set. We're in kind of a strange period right now because you over '19. This is an MLK weekend, and MLK weekend was next weekend. So I think once we get past MLK, we'll give you a better view, but we're counting on it to stay in that roughly 80%.  That's not -- the survey would indicate that it's better than that. So I think that's -- if it does materialize better than that, that's upside for our forward-looking forecasts. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Glen, if I look at the RASM guide for Q1, down about 6% just in absolute terms from Q4. So that's worse than normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality. Any color on that? And then when do we really start to see this hub tailwinds show up in RASM? Right. Well, quarter-over-quarter, we had a 2-point increase in domestic stage. So -- and that, again, is unique to Delta, and we think that's about 1 point of pressure from the 19 down to the 16.  There's another international mix, length of haul changing internationally as well. So that's another point.   And so then we're thinking about this as really being sequentially about 1 point difference to get from a 91% restoration all the way up to 99% restoration. So for core same-store store sales, we're actually seeing first quarter being stronger than fourth quarter.  And with that sequential improvement from February being better than January and March being better than February, so I think we're sitting in a pretty exciting place right now as we look at how '23 is starting.  The rebuild of the core, we wish we could do it sooner. Again, I think our priority has been to make sure that we can sustain industry-leading operations. And so that's going to work throughout the year. I think when we talked about it at the Investor Day, we didn't really give you color that this is not a first quarter event.  While there's some rebuild domestically in the core, the major rebuilds, we expect, for example, Atlanta, which was about 85% last year in terms of seats to be close to 95% by summer and then 100% by fall with Minneapolis, close to Atlanta and then Detroit a little bit behind.  So we're working on that. That's our priority, and we will get there, we believe, by fall, but it really doesn't impact significantly the first quarter's quarter. Okay. And then just for Dan, just help bridge us from CASM up 3% to 4% in Q1 to down 2% to 4% for the year? You mentioned maintenance. How much does that hurt Q1? How much has that then helped the back half? Any color here? Yes, certainly. There's two pieces in there, maintenance being one. It's about a 2-point headwind in the first quarter and first half, and it's driven by engine induction levels and scope of work related to that.  As you get into the back half of the year, that's a 2-point to 3-point benefit year-over-year. So a 5-point progression from beginning to end. And then the second piece of that is related to the completion of our rebuild and those rebuild costs stepping down. Most of our rebuild, over 85% of that cost is in the first half of the year. You don't have that in the back half of the year.  And as Glen just talked about, one of the enablers that efficiency is as we restore the core hubs, these low-cost subs, low [ CP, ] most cost competitive as we put that capacity and that drives efficiency of our assets and our workforce.  That is 5 points. So the 5 points related to that and the 5 points related to maintenance is 10-point progression as you go through the year from the beginning to the end, and that drives that continuous cadence improvement as you go through the quarters. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. First, I wanted to maybe ask about just profitability levels. You finished the year with 8% margins and are guiding to Q1 with 4% to 6%. And given the full year guide, how do we think about margin progression throughout the year? It will -- part of it is tied to the cost progression. And as you see that progression being up. And I said to you get about a 10-point improvement in cost from beginning to end, that will drive your expansion of margins throughout the year as you progress, along with what then Glen talked about, which was the commercial rebuild related to the core. So you'll see progression.  Certainly, year-over-year, the improvement versus the comp that we're coming off drives some material improvement here in the first quarter, over $1 billion pretax, a big part of the step-up in earnings year-over-year, but you'll also see improvement as we go through the year. That's helpful. And then just maybe one follow-up related to that, just margin progression. I think, Ed, you mentioned high-margin Pacific routes opening up, I think it was Australia and Korea, what are 1 to 2 items we should watch for as we see that international recovery help margin momentum? Our international recovery is well underway. And if you think about Europe, it will actually be bigger in the transatlantic this year than we were in '19 by about 8 points in terms of seats. Early advanced bookings for that are incredibly strong. So we're very pleased with how that's developing.   And so what's really left to reopen is China. And that's -- we're not going to get ahead of ourselves in terms of capacity to China. We're going to be very mindful to see how demand warrants and how this opens up, but that's the big question mark, I think, in terms of international demand for 2023 that we don't know yet. I think the others we're very confident that we have a good path forward that will get us back to '19 or bigger at better margins. And I think as we talked about at Investor Day, the multiyear progression on international, the structural elements here, right, the next-generation fleet that we're at, reconfiguration of more premium seats with DPS, better cargo capability, stronger partner network, all those are systematic drivers not only in this year but really on a multiyear basis. And if you go back in our history, not to go into too much detail, but we had a multiyear restructure of our Asia capacity and that has been a drag on earnings for many years leading up to the pandemic. And now as we come out of that, we feel like our restructuring is really done in earnest. And so we should see really good improvements in specific profitability moving forward. Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Glen, it's been a while since we visited the topic of domestic and international RASM premiums. We know what those metrics were pre-COVID. There's obviously been quite a bit of international upheaval since then, a bit of domestic change. And of course, the premium market at least is stronger than what I was anticipating in 2019. How should we think about the magnitude of Delta's RASM premiums going forward and any related timing? Yes. I think right now, we're sitting probably at a low point relative to the industry given our stage length and the way we rebuilt the airline. And I would expect to gain a couple -- 2 to 3 points domestically back as we get towards the back half of the year on how we rebuild the airline.  So that's how I view it. I'm pleased with at a macro level or at an individual flight level. I'm pleased with where we are. When you add it all up, the sum total looks like we're taking a step backwards, but I think it's really the way we've done it rather than a structural look away from Delta or anything that we're losing customers. So I think we're in a good spot for that. Okay. And second for Dan, as we think about the order book, particularly on the wide-body side, considering the OEM backlogs that -- Catie, welcome back, by the way, I mentioned in her question. How should we be thinking about the cadence of CapEx in the coming years?  We tend to model you on a normalized basis, but one of your competitors is on a CapEx holiday, another right now is on a CapEx vendor. I'm just trying to assess whether 2024 represents a potential peak in cash flow in light of future aircraft needs. I think it's steady as it goes. We've been very consistent, very deliberate, very disciplined related to CapEx. We certainly had this period where this past year in 2022, there was some catch-up in there. We're continuing to do that here in 2023 for what was deferred for a couple of years. But I think as you exit 2024, you're normalized now. At the same time, we're getting bigger as an airline and growing from that perspective. But I think it's a good foundation for us as it relates to where we're stepping off in 2024. Yes, Jamie, this is Ed. I'd agree with Dan's comments. Don't forget, we are exclusively taking Airbus equipment over the last couple of years, the next couple of years pretty much, and we'll be back with the MAX starting in '25.   So we did not have any supply interruption of any note over the last couple of years through the pandemic this year or the years going forward. So there's a consistency, and I'm confident you're going to see a -- you're not going to see any jumps or any significant declines. We're ensuring that we're staying rated within our sweet spot here on the fleet. Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Maybe just start with Glen on transatlantic. Typically, this is a pretty quiet time of the year, but it appears the industry sort of doing less seasonal shaping or kind of deseasonalizing transatlantic, which probably makes sense in light of rebuild for the summer. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in Transatlantic, less about this summer and more about getting from here to there? Right. Well, there's not a lot of room between here and there. We're seeing really robust bookings for March and beyond. So it's really -- if I look at how we view the transatlantic, there's April through October peak spring, March is getting to be a peak month these days. So that leaves you really the non-holiday weeks in November and the non-holiday weeks in January and February as really your low periods.  And so how we've shaped it this year is we've had a bigger transatlantic in 2019. We had some operational issues in Amsterdam. Excluding those, we were very pleased with the results in the off-peak season, and it's setting up really well because I think one of the things that you forget about building up for the summer is the first few weeks for the high point of sale U.S. travel are always throwaway weeks because you've got a significant amount of outbound traffic and very light inbound traffic.  So getting those out of the way earlier in the season and really allowing the summer peak to be even more robust than it has been before is, I think, how we're shaping. So I don't know if I answered your question, but I'd say we really like what we saw. There are things we're going to do differently next year. There are learnings from this year that we can improve on. So we're excited about those learnings. And then really excited about the summer peak season to Europe. We think this is going to be a record breaker. And then just on fuel, maybe this is Ed or Dan. You own a refinery. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for jet fuel? And I'm not asking for guidance, we can obviously see that. But just with respect to the unusually high crack spreads and refining margins, which week-to-week look like we're going to get relief, and then that relief sort of goes away. Obviously, you have a hedge in that regard, but I wondered if you could talk kind of intermediate term about when the -- when we see sort of refining margin relief? Yes. No, you saw it, yes, constrained markets throughout 2022, stayed elevated certainly was disrupted significantly in the second quarter, particularly -- we don't anticipate it being at those levels for the current year, giving back. But I would say for the next 12 to 18 months, I think you're at least in a period where you're structurally constrained.  The global flows for both oil and refined products have changed. Things that used to revert both gasoline, diesel and jet coming out of Europe into the U.S. aren't taking place. Utilization of refineries are high, and you get disruptions. You've seen it as the winter storms came through in December and incredibly low temperatures, refineries were impacted and you're seeing the rippling effect here in January and the unusual nature, even in the last 7 to 10 days, where the physical market is short. Jet, many times throughout 2022, it was diesel. And you see a spike. And then the -- as the refineries get the utilization back up and optimize you get a balancing, but they're still tight, and we expect them to stay elevated. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Glen, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the corporate demand side on the -- across the international entities? And just as you get to the summer, I realized it's early days, but where you expect kind of capacity be restored across these entities? Yes. I think we talked a little bit about that in the previous question. We expect the transatlantic to be about 108% restored to 2019 levels. So it will be bigger than 2019. Most of that is engaged as we bring in the newer, more efficient fleets. So we have some exciting departures.  We haven't loaded our entire summer schedule yet. That will be announced over the next 8 to 10 days. There are a few more things we need to put back in. And then in the Pacific, absent of China, we are more than rebuilt in Australia. We're more than rebuilt in Korea, and we are about 75% rebuilt in Japan. We expect to be somewhere between 75% and 100% rebuilt in Japan.  If we do or don't receive slot waivers -- if we do receive slot waivers, we're probably sitting at 75%. If we don't, we'll go back to 100%. And then China is the big question mark, as I mentioned earlier. We just don't know what's going to go on there with demand. So we're not going to get ahead of that and publish a China schedule for the summer that we don't know if we can fly and we don't know if the demand will be there. So we'll let demand drive what we're going to -- we're going to fly in China.  And then last but not least, in Latin, we are very close to fully restoring Latin right now with Deep South really starting to turn on with our partners at LATAM and getting some really, really positive early results on that. So I think other than China, we are fully restored internationally, and we see international restoration where countries are open, and that's very similar to domestic at about 80%. I appreciate that. And just kind of a quick follow-up. Just on the kind of change fees and the revenue that you're seeing here, the dropping of the change fees, what kind of an impact is that having as you kind of think about the network or the revenue? And will it be different once things are fully restored versus where it is today? Yes. Change fees accounted for almost $1 billion of revenue in the pre-pandemic world. And we were on a path, even absent of the pandemic to change, change fees. They have become onerous, people didn't like them and trying to give customers what they want -- we're on a path to a different approach that got accelerated. And I think we're very happy with where we are today, giving customers choice in how they want to fly.  And I'd say we're counting on about half of that $1 billion to be replaced by people who want flexible, fully refundable at time of purchase, which is an option that they're choosing as opposed to being imposed on that. And the rest of that is then coming from a higher share of total customer base and upsells more than covering to produce the record revenues that we expect this year. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Just on the question that Scott talked about the bridge on the cost side. I don't think you mentioned gauge or asset utilization improving throughout there. Can you just provide some color around where you expect those 2 metrics to kind of be meaningful tailwinds as you move throughout the year? The reason why I asked is that there's a lot of changes on the regional side. I would think that, that would be a pretty big tailwind from you? Yes, the mainline asset utilization increases about -- mid-single digit, about 5% as we progress through the year. So we get the benefit associated with that. And as we talked about at Investor Day, we continue to get the benefit associated with age. Just related to regional flying, as you know, we have about 1/3 of our regional flight -- flying that has not been flown today. And that's also one of the disparities between seat restoration and capacity restoration. We're not expecting a significant increase of that until the end of '23 and into '24. So we're going to be carrying that... We're carrying that underutilization regional network absolutely in our run rate. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then on the AmEx targets, I'm a little surprised that those aren't being revised up from 6.5%, from 5.5%, I mean that's basically mirroring the capacity growth year-over-year. I would just think that there would be some outperformance just given the fact that, that portfolio has grown a fair bit.   Can you just talk about like what you need to see to push those targets up? Or did you just see a lot of pull forward in consumer spend that kind of inflated the 2022 number? Just trying to unpack that a little bit. Well, we're pretty excited about hitting a $6.5 billion number. Hopefully, there's upside to that. I think we -- it's January. We don't want to commit to that. But -- we're ahead of our long-term goals for that, and we continue to find ways to accelerate our long-term goals.  And I think next year or maybe even in June, we're going to give you what's beyond the $7 billion because our first market was how do you get the $7 billion? And when we said that, I think it was a daunting task for us. It was a daunting task for the team. We're there, right? And I think the question really for us, and I was investor, okay, you're at the $7 billion, what's next? And that's what we've got to be working on showing you that we're not done here. Yes. And the other thing, Conor, is that it's not driven by capacity, as you can appreciate, it's driven by the spend on the portfolio. So that's a pretty sizable increase in portfolio spend as well. Your next question is coming from Helane Becker from Cowen. Sort of a question about tech ops. Pre-pandemic, you guys were building that business out. It was going to be a more than $1 billion revenue business at some point. How are you thinking about that coming out of the pandemic and into sort of the middle part of this decade into the end? Or is that something that is another focus or is that being supplanted by the other revenues that you're talking about? Helane, this is Ed. We are incredibly excited about your question and the MRO. And in fact, we made great progress during the pandemic to continue to accelerate that vision when we sign a deal to acquire the LEAP as part of the MAX deal. So we now have basically all the new engine technologies on our platform with exclusive arrangements and opportunities for third-party work that will extend over the next 20 years. Obviously, in the short term, our focus is on -- to every extent we have labor, and we have supply challenges focusing on the Delta metal and continuing to get the airline itself back up and running. So the MRO has taken a little bit of a backseat over the short term. But we continue to make the investments where we've got the commitments from all of our partners on the engine side. And this is something you're going to hear a fair bit about in June when we look at the strategic discussion that we're looking to create. Right in June. Okay. That's going to be really helpful. And then, Ed, can I please ask you in June, if you will also update us on your diversity and inclusion targets. We talked a lot about that pre-pandemic. And then during the pandemic, you've obviously hired 25,000 new people. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks. Can you also, at some point, update us on how that's going? And whether you're meeting your own internal goals? You don't have to share those with us, but if you can share with us how it's coming along. That might be helpful. We will certainly do that, and that was already in the plan, Helane, to go through that in June. The good news is that we are making great progress and we will share our targets because we share them publicly. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. First question for Glen. I guess, based on my math, it seems like you're assuming PRASM could start to decline sort of in the high single digits year-over-year as you move through 2023 to kind of get to your 15% to 20% revenue outlook. What drives that assumption, particularly given kind of the RASM benefit you should have from your mid-continent growth strategy? I think when we look at the progression through the quarter, we had some very extenuating circumstances last second quarter and early third quarter with fuel running up over $120 a barrel. And as we think about how we do fuel recapture on the way up, we also -- as inflation cools down and as fuel comes down, we're not going to keep all of that.  We're going to keep as much of it as we can. And we're not anticipating that big mobile and fuel, which is driving the sequential decrease. So we'll see how it actually rolls out and hopefully it's better than that, but that's how we're thinking about how the year progresses in terms of absolute unit revenues. That makes sense. And then I just ask you kind of strategically here, Glen. As you've seen the revenue environment continue to show this strength pretty much since kind of almost a year ago, are you seeing any changes in behavior from any of your competitors that may show that they're acting differently today than they would have pre-pandemic? Yes. We don't really talk about how our competitors behave. I think what we've seen is we've seen a very big shift in how and why people travel, and trying to stay ahead of that in our own planning and make sure that we are capturing where people want to go and what products they want to buy. And that's really our continued focus. And it's been a very interesting journey. And as you look at individual market levels, we're very different sizes than we were pre-pandemic based on where our customers want us to take in these days. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Glen, just a quick question, sort of following up on Conor's on loyalty. It feels like with the free WiFi, this is going to be a banner year for SkyMiles. I think last year $8.5 million. How do we think about the conversion of number of SkyMiles to ultimately those who uptake on the credit card? I think this last year, it was like an 8:1 ratio. Is that kind of what it's been historically? Yes, I think that's about right. That's one of the -- we see the more engaged the customers with Delta, the higher their satisfaction is. And so that's really part of that ecosystem that we're really trying to grow. SkyMiles is an entry point. Of course, as everybody knows, it's free. And now they have an incentive to do that because there's an immediate benefit to join because you get the free WiFi.  And so how do we translate that ultimately into more loyal customers who eventually will wind up getting some of our other products? And that's really what our flywheel is right now and how we're going to continue to press forward in terms of loyalty. Great. Very good. And then just second question on Dan, you talked about non-ops, the $470 million headwind, obviously, noncash pension expense, maybe there's some other items. How do we think about through the year? Is that ratably? Is it lumpy? And what tax rate should we be using on March quarter, full year? Yes, 1.3 for the year. The first quarter, think of it being closer to -- if it was ratable, it would be about [ 330 ] a quarter. First quarter will be a little bit higher. We think about it as [ 360 ] to [ 365 ] associated with it. And tax rate continues to be consistent, right, in that 24% to 24.5%. We'll now go to our final analyst question. Certainly, your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Keep it to one as well. Dan, can you talk about your normal amortization this year, which I think is about $2.5 billion relative to the $2 billion of free cash flow that you guys are anticipating? And what are your options here, especially in a higher interest rate environment? How does that change your capital priorities in any way? Yes, we have normal maturities at 2.4. We had 1.8 this past year, and we ended up retiring $4.5 billion of debt. Ken and the team were opportunistic in regards to debt that we can take out that we think is higher cost and has good economic payback associated with it.  And given our liquidity position, as we progress through this year, we'll continue to look at those options. There are certainly a number out there that are targets for us, but we'll either do it through how we've done it with -- through tenders, but also just as you go open market repurchases and being smart and going after the higher cost debt. That's a priority. We want to drive down that nonop interest line over time. And the team is good at it. They've done it, did it for a decade, they'll continue to do it. And I guess, Dan, how does a higher interest rate environment here change your capital priorities, if at all? About changing it, I think it does -- when it may change in regards to how you look at some of your debt, some of them that are off of LIBOR and floating have become more attractive to retire in certain situations. So -- but we're continuing to be focused on -- as you know, it's reinvesting back in the business, but also this path to deleveraging. So continuing to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce debt and drive down those leverage ratios. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes, our Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, to start the media questions. Thank you, Julie. Matt, if you don't mind, could we reiterate for the members of the media, the practice for getting in the call queue? And in addition to thanking each of them for their time this morning, just to remind everyone around one question and one follow-up so we can get through as many of these as we could, please. Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Claire Bushey from Financial Times. I was wondering, what needs, in your opinion, to happen at the FAA so that what happened on Wednesday doesn't happen again? Claire, it's Ed. I missed the first part of your question. Your question is what? What does the FAA need to do in order to ensure there's no repeat of Wednesday? Correct. Well, if you saw my comments this morning on CNBC, I think it's very clear that there has to be a call to action amongst our political leaders, the Congress and the White House, to fund and properly provide the FAA the resources they need to do the job.  We've long talked about the need for modernization of our air traffic control systems. I think this is a crystal clear example of the challenge the FAA has faced when you have aging systems that aren't as resilient as they need to be. You have tools and technologies that are somewhat outdated and staffing levels, not where they need to be.  So FAA I know is doing the very best they can with what they have, but we need to stand behind the FAA and we need to take them off the kind of year-by-year funding that seems like they go through that's caught up in political negotiations and realize the importance of having a strong aviation infrastructure and the importance of that to our economy as well as our public. Your next question is coming from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. I guess sort of a related question. But I guess curious, how much do you think that the infrastructure and aerospace issues are likely to be a constraint on growth for the industry overall, whether it vulnerability of technical systems and lack of redundancy or just controller staffing or what have you? How impactable do you expect that to be going forward? Well, it's a current constraint on our ability to grow as an industry. You see the length of flight times they're taking to complete missions. You see the -- some of the challenges the air traffic control -- controllers have when you get into congested space in the Northeast or down in Florida.  There's been a lot -- it's just even during the pandemic itself some real challenges that we've experienced. So there's no question that the investment in a modernized air traffic control system will drive a tremendous amount of efficiencies as well as growth, which will mean better service for the American public. And I guess, can you talk a little bit about sort of what sort of systems or backup or its own redundancy Delta has, like if there was another outage of the NOTAM system like we saw earlier this week? Is that something that Delta can kind of deal with or workaround? Or is that something you need to have? Or yes, there's anything you can share on that? The NOTAM system that went down is an essential system, and no airline would fly without having that capability. Interestingly, at Delta, we had and have a long -- a fairly old backup technology that does see that. And we were able to keep some of the NOTAM information flowing to Delta. So we probably had a little better opportunity to fly during this stoppage as compared to anyone else, but out of deference to the FAA and making certain that we gave them the ability to make the decisions, we didn't utilize that backup system. But -- it's an important part of our resiliency and redundancy. Your next question is coming from Kelly Yamanouchi from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. I just wanted to see if I could get you to talk a little bit more about your comments about business bookings remaining steady. It seems like the 80% recovered level in the December quarter is what you had been saying previous to that. And I wanted to see if you've got any sort of an outlook beyond the March quarter that gives you confidence that, that corporate recovery is not going to stall at some level? We do those corporate surveys, and that's why we do them to see what our corporate partners are thinking about in terms of future travel. And it was actually the last one we did, which is for future travel, was the best survey we've had since pre-pandemic in terms of their enthusiasm that more people would be flying in future months than we're flying in current or past months.  As I said in the call, we're not counting on that in our current revenue forecast because sometimes that doesn't come to fruition, but there's a sense of optimism from this pent-up demand for business travel that we see could potentially offset any weakness in the general economy. And we're taking a very cautious look, but -- and we're counting on it being stable and not growing dramatically. But it looks like people think it will grow. Mary, this is Ed. I -- you see in the -- in our country, a lot of businesses struggling to get their employees back into the office. And I think this is tied to that. As companies return and employees return to office, you're going to see another step up, in my opinion, of return to more normal trends, including improved business travel.  You think of a lot of the big accounts we serve are consultancies, legal firms, accounting firms, it's tough for them to get out on the road if they don't have the offices open of their clients and their customers. So I think that's the -- a little bit of the choppiness that Glen was referring to because that companies are intending to open and have had some -- there's been some stalls going on there. But I do think as we progress over the course of the year, you're going to see more and more of business being done like it used to be done than ever before. Okay. And if I can just follow up. I understand about your survey, but are there bookings that you can see at this point beyond the March quarter that gives you any idea of whether that weakness will continue?  And then when you said you're counting on that corporate demand being stable, but not growing dramatically, that's a change, though, from what you had been seeing, is that correct? You had been seeing growth, but now you're seeing it more stable? Clearly, in the early parts of the pandemic recovery, we saw some accelerated growth. I think we've been pretty consistent at the past couple of quarters, saying we see some stability in the booking curve at about 80% of revenue. So as you know, business travel usually has the shortest advanced purchase windows and is mostly close in. So we would not have any further visibility beyond the next 60 to 90 days that would be of any significant help in charting that water. Your next question is coming from Edward Russell from Skift. I wonder if you could comment on if Delta [ Soni ] benefit from Southwest Airlines operational issues in December? Was there an uptick in bookings people buying less [indiscernible]? Any color would be great. Sure. As you know, we had our own weather operations during the peak Christmas holiday travel period. And we saw after that, when we were fully recovered and Southwest was still not back in full swing.  We had an uptick in our bookings. That's trended in highly competitive with Southwest markets a little bit into January, but we think that will resolve itself over the next 6 to 12 months. Thank you, Edward. Matt, we have time for one final question, if we could, please. Certainly. The last question is coming from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. When you talk about getting back to full pre-pandemic capacity in your major hubs, are you talking about seats or flight numbers? And then what percent of your gauge up, let's say, in Atlanta? What will it be up this summer? And how do you think about managing crowds as you increase gauge and bring your flight numbers back up to where they were or beyond? Right. We will probably not, for the next couple of years, see the flight numbers we did in 2019. And we will get seat capacity restoration to 100%, which means that gauge will go up significantly. When you look at our fleet evolution, that was always our plan was to continue to grow not by additional departures but by larger airplanes, more efficiency, less fuel burn, better products and services. And so that's really what we're intending on doing. The pandemic accelerated that. And so you've got our average gauge up by double digits right now. That's partly because we keep taking larger airplanes but partly because the regional fleets are less restored. And we think that will normalize out over the next 18 months, but we will probably not, for the foreseeable future, get back to the flight levels, although we will match or exceed by the end of the year at the historic levels in terms of seat capacity. Any -- with the higher gauge, do you end up with more crowded banks in terms of number of passengers? Or is that a swag by having less flights... No, I think -- that's why we've done these generational builds across our network is that we knew that bigger gauge was coming, we needed to accommodate it. And even for example, here in Atlanta, we've worked closely with the city to reconfigure the deconcourse to be wider than any of the other concourses to accommodate that increased gauge. So we've got short-, medium- and long-term plans to accommodate those gauges. A lot of that was in our generational builds across the network, and we don't think that it's going to be more crowded than it was in '19 or feel more crowded. Thank you, Robert. Matt, that will wrap our call for today. We're grateful for everyone's time and participation. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today."

         "Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America earnings announcement. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call will be recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for joining the call to review the fourth quarter results. I know it's a busy day with lots of banks reporting and we appreciate your interest. I trust everybody has had a chance to review our earnings release documents. They're available, including the earnings presentation that we'll be referring to during the call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website. I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments and then ask Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover some other elements of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and SEC filings available on our website. Information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to U.S. GAAP, can also be found in our earnings materials that are available on the website. So with that, take it away, Brian. Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I am starting on Slide 2 of the earnings presentation. During the fourth quarter of 2022, our team once again delivered responsible growth for our shareholders. We reported $7.1 billion of net income after tax or $0.85 per diluted share. We grew revenue 11% year-over-year and delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage. And again, we delivered a strong 16% return on tangible common equity. If you move to Slide 3, we list the highlights of the quarter, which have been pretty consistent throughout the year. We drove good organic customer activity and saw significant increases in net interest income, which all helped drive operating leverage. Revenue increased year-over-year 11%. It was led by a 29% improvement in net interest income, coupled with a strong 27% growth in sales and trading results by Jimmy DeMare and the team. This growth will exceed the impacts of lower investment banking fees and the impact of bond and equity market valuations on asset management fees in our wealth management business. The positive contributions of NII and sales and trading were also enough to overcome a decline in service charges driven by the fully implemented changes in NSF and overdraft fees in our consumer business. Importantly, we improved our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by 25 basis in quarter 4 to 11.2%, and we achieved that without changing our business strategies. We're well above our both -- our current 10.4% minimum CET1 requirement and above the requirement that we'll have beginning next year in January of 10.9%. We added to our buffer of both growing loans and reducing outstanding shares in the quarter. On a year-over-year comparative basis, both net income and EPS are up modestly with strong operating leverage more than offsetting higher provision expense. The higher provision expense is driven primarily by reserve builds this quarter, a result of loan growth in our portfolios and also our conservative waiting in our reserve setting methodology, which I'll touch on later. Last year, we had large reserve releases. Net charge-offs increased this quarter, but asset quality remains strong. Charge-offs are well above both the beginning of the pandemic as well as longer-term historical levels. And again, I'll touch on this in a few pages. All that being said, the simple way to think about it is pretax, pre-provision income, which neutralizes these reserve actions, grew 23% year-over-year. Let's turn to Slide 4. Slide 4 shows the year-over-year annualized results. And quarter 4 results were a nice finish to a successful year in which we produced $27.5 billion in net income on 7% revenue growth and a 4% operating leverage. While the year was strong, full year earnings declined as a result of loan loss reserve actions. For the full year of 2022, again, we built about $370 million reserves. And by contrast, last year, in '21, we released $6.8 billion of reserves. Isolating those changes, again, you'll see that PPNR grew a strong 14% over 2021. As I said earlier, the themes were characterized by good organic customer activity, strong NII and always helped by years of responsible growth. Slide 5 highlights some of the attributes of organic growth for the quarter and the year. This, plus the slides that we include each earnings materials in our appendix, would show digital trends and organic growth highlights across all the businesses. Our investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for our customers and our teammates as well as renovating our facilities have allowed us to continue to enhance the customer experience to record high levels and fuel organic growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we added 195,000 net new checking accounts, bringing the total for the year to more than 1 million. This is twice the rate of addition that we had in 2019 in periods before the pandemic. This net growth has led to 10% increase in our customer checking accounts since the pandemic while keeping that 92% of our accounts are primary checking accounts of the household, and the average opening balance, not the average balance, but the average opening balance of these new accounts is over $5,000. We also produced more than 1 million new credit cards, the sixth consecutive quarter of doing that, bringing us back to levels that we generate pre-pandemic. Credit quality, you can see on Appendix Slides 28, for consumer remains very high in new originations. Verified digital users grew to 56 million with 73% of our consumer households fully digitally active. We have more than 1 billion log-ins to our digital platforms each month, and that's been going on for some time now. Digital sales are also growing, and they now represent half of our sales in the consumer business. Erica, our virtual digital system, is now handling 145 million interactions this past quarter and has passed 1 billion interactions since its introduction just a few years ago. This saves a lot of work for our team. When you move to the GWIM business, the wealth management business, our advisers grew by 800 in the second half of the year. Our team added 28,000 net new households across Merrill and the Private Bank in 2022. We experienced solid net flows despite the turbulence of markets. By the way, during 2022, our average Merrill household opened with balances of $1.6 million to get very high-quality account openings. On flows, when confined across all our investment platforms in our consumer wealth management business, we saw $125 billion of net client flows this year. Additionally, we continue to see increased activity around both investments in our GWIM business and our banking products. Diversified bank element added a strong differentiator for us as a company. It also supports the healthy pretax margin. This helped the GWIM business deliver strong operating leverage for the year, and they grew net revenue and net income to records.  In our Global Banking business, we saw solid loan production and growing use of our digital platform throughout the year and added new clients to our portfolio. As you well know, the overall investment banking fee pool was down. However, we continue to deepen and expand client relationships with our build-out of commercial bankers. Our global treasury services business also grew revenue 38% year-over-year as a result of both rates as well as fees for service on cash management. In Global Markets, we had our highest fourth quarter sales and trading performance on record, growing 27% from last year ex-DVA. This was led by a strong performance in our macro FICC businesses, where we made continuous investments in the past 18 months. Equities had a record quarter 4 performance as well. Let's move to Slide 6 and talk about operating leverage. As I've said to you for many years, one of the primary goals of this company, which is an important part of our shareholder return model, has been to drive operating leverage. Those efforts, including investments made for the future, coupled with revenue growth, produced 18 straight quarters of operating leverage, as you can see, leading up to the pandemic. Beginning last year, in the third quarter of '21 -- 2021, I told you that we now started achieving operating leverage and got back on streak, 6 M or 6 quarters of operating leverage despite all the things that are going on out there, and the team continues to drive towards that for 2023. So I thought I'd spend a few minutes on a discussion of topics that's been important to, as we've talked about, investors over the last couple of months, deposits and credit. So let's go to Slide 7. First, on deposits. There are several factors impacting deposits as our industry works through and the economy works through an impressive period, a surge in deposits from the pandemic-related stimulus, the impact of monetary -- unprecedented monetary easing, impact of high inflation and then the reversal of that with unprecedented pace and size of rate hikes and monetary tightening. But on a year-on-year basis, average deposits of $1.93 trillion are down 5%. This reflects the market trends, and in fact, it reflects high tax payments to the governments in quarter 2 2022. In addition, as we move forward through 2022, customers with excess cash, investment-oriented cash, saw yield as rates increase for money market funds, direct treasuries and other products. It's probably more relevant to discuss the more near-term trends. Comparing third quarter of '22 to fourth quarter of '22, average deposits were down 1.9%. Noninterest-bearing deposits are down 8%, while interest-bearing deposits are up 2%. The mix shift is especially pronounced in treasury services in the Global Banking business. Corporate treasurers manage $500 billion of deposits they have with us. The impact of their activities has a change in the mix. On the personal side, you can see the checking account balances floating down a little bit from core expenses and spending while more affluent customers put money into higher-yielding deposits in the market. We do manage all these products differentially. And the discussion of deposits by business segment you can see on Slide 8, and we'll talk through that. So this breaks down our deposits in a more near-term trend. In the upper left, you can see the full year across -- for the whole company going across the page in the upper left-hand chart. We also put in the rate hikes that you can see. On the chart, you can see the heavy tax payment outflows in the second quarter. Then we saw the acceleration of rate hikes and deposits to move to products seeking yield in certain customer segments. But in large part, what you've seen over the course of the quarter 4 has been stabilization and more normal client activity. Simply put, we ended quarter 4 of '22 with $1.93 trillion in deposits, roughly the overall level as we ended in quarter 3 ending deposit balances. So let's look at those differentiated by business. In consumer, looking at the upper right chart, we show the difference between the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts to somewhat higher-yielding nonchecking accounts, money market and saving accounts and a limited portion of CDs. Across the quarter, we saw a $24 billion decline in total, down 2%. We have seen small declines in customers' continued higher levels of spending, pay down debt and also move money to the brokerage accounts even in this business. Higher wages have offset this. While we saw a decline in quarter 4 deposits in consumer, correspondingly, we also saw brokerage levels of consumer investments increased $11 billion, capturing a good portion of those deposits. In general, think of these consumer deposits as being very sticky of $1 trillion. That stickiness, along with net checking account growth, reflect the recognition and the value proposition of a relationship transactional account with our company. It also has -- it reflects industry-leading digital capabilities we offer and the convenience of a nationwide franchise. It also reflects that the customers in our mass market segments have fewer excess cash investment style cash balances. 56% of the $1 trillion in consumer deposits remain in low and no interest checking accounts. And because of all that, overall rate paid in this segment remains low at 6 basis points. In wealth management, which you can see at the bottom left of the chart, more than $300 billion of deposits became more stable across the fourth quarter. They also -- here, you also witnessed a shift to higher-yielding preferred deposits, as you can see on the labels, from lower-yielding transaction deposits as these customers have more excess cash and move them to seek higher yields. Early in the quarter, we saw modest declines in balances, but November's rate hikes began to slow and the probability of future rate hikes became less. People had moved their money, and we saw an uptick in balances as we move through the quarter. This reflects the seasonal inflows that happened in the fourth quarter for wealth management clients. At the bottom right chart, you can see the most dynamic part of this equation. Our Global Banking deposit movement moves across $500 billion in customer deposits. The shift here is what drives the mix total for the company. It's pretty typical with the exception that it happened very quickly in quarter 4 driven by the pace of rate hikes. In a rising rate environment, where a company's operational funds are more expensive, we anticipate these changes, particularly in the high liquidity environments as clients use both cash inventory yield, pay down debt or manage their cash for investment yield. We have seen the mix of Global Banking interest-bearing deposits move from 35% last quarter to 45% in quarter 4. And obviously, we're paying higher rates on those deposits to retain them. Customer pricing here is customer -- on a customer-to-customer basis based on the depth of relationship, the product usage and many other factors. So overall deposit rates paid as a percent of Fed funds increases are still very favorable to last cycle, even as rates are rising much faster than last cycle. I would note, [ belt ] to the last cycle, that the Fed increases have been rapid and we'd expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through the end of the interest rate cycle. So just remember, while we're paying more for deposits, we also get that on our asset side. That is simply why the NII, net interest income, is up 29% from quarter 4 2022 versus quarter 4 2021. Now let's move to the second topic I want to touch on specifically, which is credit. And this begins on Slide 9. First, it is an intellectible truth that our asset quality of our customers remains very healthy. On the other hand, it's impossible to gainsay that the net charge-offs are moving to prepandemic levels. So in the fourth quarter, we saw net charge-offs of $689 million increased $169 million from quarter 3. The increase was driven by both higher commercial and credit card losses. As these charts show, they're still very low in the overall context. In commercial, we had a few of older company-specific loans but not related or not predictive of any broad trends in the portfolio. These were already reserved for in prior periods, and based on our methodologies, went through charge-off in quarter 4. Credit card charge-offs increased in quarter 4 as a result of the flow-through of modest increase in last quarter's late-stage delinquencies. This should continue as we transition off the historic lows in delinquencies to still very low prepandemic levels. Provision expense was $1.1 billion in quarter 4. In addition to higher charge-off, provision included roughly $400 million reserve build. This was higher than quarter 3, reflecting good credit card and other loan growth combined with the reserve setting scenario. So let's just stop on the reserve setting scenario. Our scenario -- our baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession. That's the base case of the economic assumptions in the blue chip and other methods we use. But we also add to that a downside scenario. And what this results in is 95% of our reserve methodologies weighted towards a recessionary environment in 2023. That includes higher expectations of inflation leading to depressed GDP and higher unemployment expectations. This scenario is more conservative than last quarter's scenario. Now to be clear, just to give you a sense of how that scenario plays out, it contemplates a rapid rise in unemployment to peak at 5.5% early this year in 2023 and remain at 5% or above all the way through the end of '24, obviously, much more conservative than the economic estimates that are out there. We included again the updated slides in the appendix on Pages 36 and 37 to highlight differences in our credit portfolios between pre-financial pre-pandemic and current status. We also, again, gave you the new origination statistics for consumer credit on Page 28. The work the team has done on responsible growth continues to show strong results. From an outsider's view, you don't have to look any further in the Fed stress test results. We've had the lowest net charge-offs for peer banks in 10 of the last 11 stress tests. On Slides 10 to 12, we included some longer-term perspective. We showed long-term trends for commercial net charge-offs, total consumer charge-off rates, and more specifically, credit card charge-off rates. This compares those ratios to pre-financial crisis, during the recovery after the financial crisis, pre-pandemic and then through the pandemic. So that gives you a long-term perspective, which I think keeps in context the idea that we're moving off the bottom in credit cost towards a level which is normalizing to pre-pandemic, but that level is very low in the grand context of banking. So before I move it to Alastair, I want to just update a few comments on our consumer behavior. Consumer deposit balances continue to show strong liquidity with the lower cohorts of our consumers continue to hold several multiples of balance that they have as the pandemic began. These balances are drifting down, but they still have plenty of cushion left. And while their spending remains healthy, we continue to see the pace of that year-over-year growth slow. In the aggregate, in 2022, our consumer spent $4.2 trillion, which outpaced 2021 by 10%. You can see that on Slide 35. Two things to note on that consumer spending pace. There continues to be a slowdown. Year-over-year growth percentage earlier this -- earlier in 2022 were 14% year-over-year. They've now moved to 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So what does this spend mean? Well, that level of growth in year-over-year spending is consistent with the low inflation, 2% growth economy, we saw pre-pandemic. They're also moving from services to -- from goods to service and experience and spend more money on travel vacations and eating out and things like that. That is a good for unemployment, but continues to maintain service side inflation pressure. With that, let me pass the mic over to Alastair to go through the rest of the quarter. Alastair? Okay. Thanks, Brian. And let me start with the balance sheet, and I'll use Slide 13 for this. During the quarter, our balance sheet declined $23 billion to $3.05 trillion driven by modestly lower Global Markets balances. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting the decrease in deposits and securities levels. And that $868 billion, it still remains $300 billion above our prepandemic levels. Shareholders' equity increased $3.7 billion from the third quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital we distributed to shareholders and roughly $700 million in redemption of some preferred securities. We paid out $1.8 in common dividends. And we bought back $1 billion of shares, which was $600 million above those issued for employees in the quarter. AOCI was little changed in the quarter as a small benefit from lower mortgage rates was more than offset by a change in our annual pension revaluation. With regard to regulatory capital, our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.9% versus our minimum requirement of 5%. And that obviously leaves capacity for balance sheet growth, and our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 14 and talk about CET1, where, as you can see, our capital remains strong as our CET1 level improved to $180 billion and our CET1 ratio improved 25 basis points to 11.2%. That means in the past 2 quarters, we've improved our CET1 ratio by 74 basis points as we've added to our management buffer on top of both our current and 2024 requirements. So we can walk through the drivers of the CET1 ratio this quarter, and you can see earnings net of preferred dividends generated 43 basis points, common dividends used 11 basis points, and gross share repurchases used 6 basis points. And while the balance sheet was down, loan growth drove a modest increase in RWA using 3 basis points of CET1. So we were able to support our loan growth and return capital and add to our capital buffer in the same quarter. Let's spend a minute on the loan growth by focusing on average loans on Slide 15. And here, you can see average loans grew 10% year-over-year, driven by credit card and commercial loan improvement. On a more near-term linked-quarter basis, loans grew at a slower 2% annualized pace just driven by credit card. The credit card growth reflects increased marketing, enhanced offers and reopening of our financial centers, delivering higher levels of account openings. Mortgage balances were up modestly year-over-year, and linked quarter were driven by slower prepayments. Commercial growth reflects a good balance of Global Markets lending as well as commercial real estate and to a lesser degree, custom lending in our Private Bank and Merrill businesses. Turning to Slide 16 and net interest income. On a GAAP, non-FTE basis, NII in Q4 was $14.7 billion, and the FTE NII number was $14.8 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $3.3 billion from Q4 of '21 or 29% driven by a few notable components. First, nearly $3.6 billion of the year-over-year improvement in NII was driven by interest rates. Year-over-year, the average Fed funds rates has increased 359 basis points, driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets. Relative to that Fed funds move, the rate paid on our total deposits increased 59 basis points to 62. And focusing just on interest-bearing deposit rates paid, the increase is 91. So even while Fed funds rates have increased 140 basis points more than the last cycle, at this point, our cumulative pass-through percentage rates still remain lower in this cycle. That includes an increase in the pass-through rates in the past 90 days due to the unprecedented period of rate hikes. Included in the rate benefit was $1 billion improvement in the quarterly securities premium amortization. Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased 345 basis points from the fourth quarter of '21, which has driven down refinancing of mortgage assets and therefore, slowed the recognition of premium amortization expense recognized in our securities portfolio. The second contributor is loan growth net of securities paydowns, and that's added nearly $400 million to the year-over-year improvement. And lastly, partially offsetting the banking book NII growth just described was higher funding costs for our Global Markets inventory. Now that is passed on to clients through our noninterest market-making line, so it's revenue neutral to both sales and trading and to total revenue. And as you can see in our material, Global Markets NII is down $660 million year-over-year. Okay. Turning to a linked quarter discussion. NII is up $933 million from the third quarter driven largely by interest rates. That $933 million increase included a $372 million decline in our Global Markets NII. The net interest yield was 2.22%, and that improved 55 basis points from the fourth quarter of '21. Nearly 30% of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter with the primary driver being the benefit from higher interest rates, which includes a 13 basis point benefit from lower premium amortization. As you will note, excluding Global Markets, our net interest yield was up 89 basis points to 2.81%. Looking forward, I would make a couple of comments. As I do every quarter, let me provide the important caveats regarding our NII guidance. Our caveats include assumptions that interest rates in the forward curve materialize, and we anticipate card loans will decline seasonally from holiday spend paydowns. And otherwise, we expect modest loan growth. We expect a seasonal decline in Global Banking deposits and that the other deposit mix shifts experienced in Q4 may continue into the first quarter in the face of more rate hikes. We also expect the funding cost for Global Markets to continue to increase based on higher rates. And as noted, the impact of that is recognized and offset in noninterest income, so it's revenue neutral. So starting with the fourth quarter NII of $14.8 billion. And assuming a decline of roughly $300 million of Global Markets NII in Q1, which would be similar to the fourth quarter decline, that would get us to a Q1 number around $14.5 billion. In addition, we have to factor in 2 less days of interest, which is about $250 million. So that would lower our starting point to $14.25 billion. We believe the core banking book will continue to show the benefit of rates and other elements and can offset most of the day count. So we're expecting Q1 NII to be somewhere around $14.4 billion. Beyond Q1, with increases in rates slowing and if balances continue their recent stabilization trends, expect less variability in NII for the balance of 2023. Okay. Let's turn to expense, and we'll use Slide 17 for the discussion. Q4 expenses were $15.5 billion, and they were up $240 million from Q3, driven by an increase in our people and technology costs. In addition, we also saw higher costs from our continued return to work and travel and cost of client engagement. We've seen pent-up demand for our teams gathering back together in person to drive collaboration and to spend more time with our clients. Inflationary pressures continued, but our operational excellence improvements as well as the benefits of a more digitized customer base helped offset those pressures. Our headcount this quarter increased by 3,600 from Q3. And as we faced increased attrition in 2022, our teams were quite successful in their hiring efforts to continue to support customers. As the attrition slowed in the fall, our accelerated pace of hiring outpaced attrition, leaving us with growth in our headcount. As we look forward to next quarter, I would just remind everyone that Q1 typically includes $400 million to $500 million in seasonally elevated payroll taxes. And Q1 will also be the first quarter to include the costs of the late October announcement by regulators of higher FDIC insurance costs. And as a result of holding the leadership share in U.S. retail deposits, that will add $125 million to each of our quarterly costs or a total of $500 million for the year. We expect these things will put expenses around $16 billion in the first quarter before expectations that they should trend back down again over the course of 2023. On asset quality, we highlight credit quality metrics on Slide 18 for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. And since Brian already covered much of the topics on asset quality, I'm going to move to a discussion of our line of business results, starting with consumer on Slide 19. Brian noted the earlier organic growth across checking accounts, card accounts, and investments were strong again this quarter, and that's as a result of many years of retooling and continuous investments in the business. So let me offer some highlights. At this point, we have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among the most important products for consumers, and we're the leading digital bank with convenient capabilities for consumer and small business clients. We also have a leading online consumer investment platform and a great small business platform offering for our clients. And importantly, when you combine all these capabilities with improved service, at this point, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs. And we produced another strong quarter of results in Consumer Banking that resulted in $12.5 billion in net income in 2022. For the quarter, Consumer Banking earned $3.6 billion on good organic growth and delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continue to invest for the future. Note that our top line grew 21%, while expense grew 8%. The earnings impact of 21% year-over-year revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in provision expense, and that provision increase reflects reserve builds this period compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net charge-offs increased as a result of the card charge-offs that Brian noted earlier. While this quarter's reported earnings were up 15% year-over-year, pretax, pre-provision income grew an even stronger 36% year-over-year. So that highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of the reserve actions. Revenue improvement reflects the fuller value of our deposit base as well as deepening with our deposit relationships. I'd note the growth also includes a decline in service charges of $335 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by the end of Q2 of this year. And as a result of those policy changes, we continue to benefit from the better overall customer satisfaction and the corresponding lower attrition and the lower costs associated with fewer customer complaint calls, obviously, as a result of fewer fees. The 8% increase in expenses reflects business investments for growth, including people and technology, along with costs related to reopening the business to fuller capacity. And remember, much of the company's minimum wage hikes and quarter 2 increased salary and wage moves impacts Consumer Banking the most of our lines of business and therefore, impacts most the year-over-year comparisons. We also continued our investment in financial centers. For the year, we opened 58 and we renovated 784 more. And against all of that, both digital banking and operational excellence helped us to pay for investments, and that allowed us to improve the efficiency ratio to 47%, an impressive 600 basis point improvement over the year ago period. Before moving away from Consumer Banking, I want to note some differences that highlight just how much more effectively and efficiently this business is running since even just before the pandemic. It's easy to lose sight of how well this business is operating from an already strong position in 2019. And you can see some of the stats on Slide 17 in the appendix. We can best summarize by noting we've got $318 billion more in deposits; 10% more checking customers, 92% of whom are primary; 28% more investment accounts. And absent the card divestitures, we've increased the amount of new card accounts by 4%, and our payment volumes are 36% higher. We're servicing those customers with 387 fewer financial centers because of our digital capabilities, and it's allowed us to need 10% fewer people to run the business. Our combined credit and debit spend was up 35%. Digital sales increased 77%, and we sent and received 3x the number of Zelle transactions. All of this allowed us to run the business with fewer employees and lower our cost of deposits ratio below 120 basis points. Moving to Slide 20. Wealth management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion on good revenue and 29% profit margin. This led to full year records for both revenue and net income of $21.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. This was an especially good result given the nearly unprecedented negative returns of both the equity and the bond markets at the same time this year. The volatility and generally lower market levels put pressure on certain revenues in this business again in Q4, but what helps differentiate Merrill and the Private Bank is a strong banking business at scale with $324 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So despite a 14% decline in asset under management and brokerage fees year-over-year, we saw revenues hold flat with the fourth quarter of '21. Our talented group of wealth advisers, coupled with powerful digital capabilities, generated 8,500 net new households in Merrill in the fourth quarter, while the Private Bank gained an impressive 550 net new high net worth relationships in the quarter. Both were up nicely from net household generation in 2021. We added $20 billion of loans in this business since Q4 of '21, growing 10% and marking the 51st consecutive quarter of average loan growth in the business despite securities-based lending reductions related to the current market environment. That's consistent and sustained performance by the teams. Our expenses declined 1%, driven by lower revenue-related incentives, partially offset by investments in our business. Moving to Global Banking on Slide 21. And you can see the business earned $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter on record revenues of $6.4 billion, pretty remarkable given the decline in investment banking fees during this year. Lower investment banking fees, higher credit costs and a modest increase in expenses were mostly offset by stronger NII and other fees. So overall, revenue grew 9%, reflecting the value of our Global Transaction Service business to our clients and our associated revenue growth, while investment banking fees declined a little more than 50%. The company's overall investment banking fees were $1.1 billion in Q4, declining $1.3 billion year-over-year in a continued tough market. Still, we increased our ranking in overall fees for the full year 2022 to #3 as we've continued to invest in the business. The $612 million increase in provision expense reflected a modest reserve build of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to a $435 million release in the year ago period, and pretax, pre-provision income grew 13% year-over-year. Expense increased 4% year-over-year, and that was driven by strategic investments in the business. including hiring and technology. Switching to Global Markets on Slide 22. And as we usually do, I'll talk about the segment results, excluding DVA. You can see our fourth quarter record results were a very strong finish to a good year. The continued themes of inflation, geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe continue to drive volatility in both bond and equity markets and repositioning from our clients. And as a result, it was another quarter that favored macro trading, while our credit trading businesses improved also. Spreads fared better than the prior year. Our fourth quarter net income of $650 million reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue partially offset by lower shares of investment banking revenue. And it's worth noting that this net income excludes $193 million of DVA losses this quarter as a result of our own credit spread movements. Reported net income was $504 million. Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $3.7 billion to revenue, and that improved 27%. That's a new fourth quarter record for this business, besting the previous one by 21%. And at $16.5 billion in sales and trading for the year, it marked the best in more than a decade. FICC improved 49%, while equities was up 1% compared to the quarter a year ago. And the FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products, while credit products also improved from a weaker Q4 '21 environment. We've been investing continuously over the past year in our macro businesses. We've identified those as opportunities for us. And again, we've been rewarded for that this quarter. Year-over-year expense increased about 10% primarily driven by investments in the business. Finally, on Slide 23, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $689 million, and that was consistent with the year ago period. For the quarter, the effective tax rate was approximately 10%, benefiting from ESG investment tax credits and certain discrete tax benefits. Excluding those discrete items, our tax rate would have been 12.5%. And further adjusting for the tax credits, it would have been 25%. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 11%, and we would not expect 2023 to be a lot different. So with that, we'll stop here, and we'll open it up, please, for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Need a little more help, you gave a lot, but I need a little more help on NII for 2023. You walked us to the $14.4 billion on starting point on the quarter, and your words were less variability in NII for the rest of '23. So I guess my question is you got a lot of loan growth. You have a few more rate hikes hopefully coming through, and I understand the opposite -- the flip side of that is deposit migration, some outflows and betas. But could you fill in those blanks because I think -- I won't speak for everybody else. I know I am -- we're still expecting some growth in NII for the calendar year. So maybe you could talk through some of those pieces and maybe the outflow in Global Banking, noninterest-bearing as a big piece of it. Glenn, I'll start with just -- just by way of context, obviously, we're coming off a period with historic inflows for pandemic deposits. And now in Q4, we're beginning to see the impact of quantitative tightening and a number of sharp rate rises. So that obviously creates some uncertainty. We don't necessarily have a playbook for that. We just got to see how actual balances perform, and we've got to see how the rotation and the rate paid develop. So it's dynamic. It's evolving, and we manage and we forecast that weekly. So when we lay out for you the actuals on Page 7 and 8 of the earnings presentation, we're trying to show you what we're seeing in real time around balances and mix. So what we've said with respect to this quarter coming up is we got to adjust for the day count as we would every year. That's timing, and we'll get that back, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. And then we highlighted the Global Markets NII impact. It's always been there. The last couple of quarters, it's been around $300 million. It is revenue neutral to shareholders as we point out because we pass that along to clients and we capture elsewhere in sales and trading, but it does obviously impact the NII. That's why we're highlighting it. But as it relates to the forecast, look, we feel like the modest balance declines are kind of in there. That may continue. And this continued rotation from some of the noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. We got some pricing and rate pressure. So that's in the back of our mind, too. And the only final thing I'll just say is we're reluctant to go a whole lot further out. Last year, we declined to give a full year guide. This year, we feel that way in particular because it's just a much more sensitive environment when we're modeling when interest rates are at 5% than when they were at 50 basis points, so for all those reasons. Now I will say this as the final point. We just got to -- I think we got to stay patient because we got to see how rates and balances and rotation shake out. And as rates return to more normal and as customer behavior -- and you can sort of see it, it's behaving maybe a little more normally, then we should be able to resume our upward path over time. But we've got to see how this shakes out, and that's why we don't want to go out beyond Q1 at this stage. Fair enough. I feel bad for all of us. Maybe a quick one on credit. Good to see charge-offs down given everything that's going on in the world. But can you talk through the big -- the $1.6 billion sequential pickup in criticized book from last quarter, what's driving that and how you feel about reserves against that? Yes. So you're aware, the main driver there is commercial real estate. And it's specifically -- around about $1 billion of it is office. Obviously, there's a significant amount of change going on in office. And what we've chosen to do is as rates are rising here, we're pushing that through the models. And just with the debt service coverage it comes down, we pushed through the downgrade. So we've chosen to do that. The performance is still okay. So we're not concerned with the performance, but we're just making sure we're being tight on the modeling there. It is obviously a portfolio where -- I think you know this. We're pretty focused on making originations into office buildings that are leased up, generally at 55% LTV at origination, and 75% of that book is Class A office building. So we're not alarmed there. We're just following our own process with respect to making sure we're current on the debt service coverage. Just remember that we're talking about office with very high-quality underwriting characteristics, all A class, et cetera. And so we just have a conservative rating process, frankly. And it's well viewed out there and well looked at by many people. But remember, office is $14 billion to $15 billion of the total portfolio. So we feel very comfortable where we are. And then obviously, we built reserves against the portfolios across the board that are strong and reflect, as I said earlier, basically a mild recession in the base case and the worst recession in the adverse case that we wait 40%. We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Alastair, on the loan loss reserving, and Brian just talked about the adverse case being about 40%. Can you guys share with us how much of the reserve building is what might be referred to as management overlay relative to what the models are specifically dictating on reserve building? Don't disclose that. But you might assume that there's a fair amount -- 3 components to this: one is what the models say; two is basically uncertain -- in precision and other things we overlay and then a judgmental, and you might think that there's a fair amount of that right now with the uncertainty. But -- so the model piece of that would be a portion of it. Very good, Brian. And then when you look at your deposit behavior of the consumer the past cycles, is there any material differences in the way they're moving money around or not moving money around from their checking accounts or low-yielding savings accounts? I think -- when you look at the higher-end consumer, not really. They move to -- when the rate in the market yields money market funds, we move them to it, and it's part of what we do. In that sort of investment cash, Gerard, as we call it, moves, the checking accounts don't move. The difference, frankly, is that there was a lot of stimulus that was in addition to the earnings power of our consumers. So we've never had that in history, but -- and so that amount of stimulus, the question is, will they spend it down or will they keep storing it up? And they've been spending it down very modestly across sort of medium income households or so and the general consumer business. Give you an example, the cohort that was $2,000 to $5,000 in average balances pre-pandemic had $3,400. They're still sitting at $12,800, but they peaked early in '22 at $13,400. So they're drifting down, but it's still multiples. The big question was, will they end up spending that down? If they're employed, probably not. But if they're -- if unemployment rate changes -- and our models assume the unemployment rate changes. So I think we're at 6 basis points now in total consumer rate paid. The rate structure is very high and we are 11 basis points, it was where we got to. We have very low CD volumes, and things have a fair amount of money markets. But most of it's checking. That's why we showed you the differential in checking. So is it different yet probably in the mass consumer business just because they are sitting on more cash and may use that cash in certain scenarios, but the rest of the behavior is largely the same, including in the corporate business where people can have less balances and the effective credit rate generates a bigger number to cover their fees, so they tend to pull the balances out. Just quickly, Brian, just when you look at the high net worth in corporate, did that move from 0% to 3% Fed funds, for example, versus 3% to where we are today at 4.5%. Is most of that completed where the people that were going to move the money have already moved it in those 2 categories? Well, I mean, I can't say definitively, but you've seen -- that's what we showed you on those pages where we showed a stable -- that the account balances are relatively stable in wealth management in the fourth quarter, $300-odd billion and $300-odd billion. Basically, they're flat if you looked across the last several weeks. So there's always a little bit of migration to the preferred deposit, which is a market for higher-yielding sort of money market account. But the big shift in that was, frankly, in the second quarter of '22, when I think we had $50 billion-odd numbers of tax payments, which was a lot higher than in past years due to -- if you think about the '21 dynamic and capital gains and other things that went through. So what we're seeing is the last 4 or 5 weeks, we're seeing relatively -- stable in deposit balances. Quarter end 3, quarter end 4, basically flat, a little bit of movement among the categories. But in that business, frankly, a fairly sort of stable place right now. And so I think this long answer, realize the sort of answer, if they move the money, they kind of already moved it. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. I guess, Alastair, I guess, no good deed goes unpunished. I mean NII did grow 21% for the year 2022. It did grow 7% linked quarter and the fourth quarter, up $900 million. But 6 weeks after you gave guidance last quarter, you lowered that guidance by $300 million. And it just raised some questions about the quality of your modeling or if you had your arms completely around the asset liability management. So what happened to cause you to change that guidance, albeit in the context of still some of the best NII growth you guys have seen in many years? Yes. So Mike, if I go back to 6 months ago, quarter 2 earnings, what we said at the time was we thought over the course of the next 6 months, NII might go up by $1.8 billion, $1.85 billion. In actual fact, it's gone up $2.25 billion. So that's the actuals. Remember, we're forecasting as best we can any given time, up $2.25 billion. Q3 was more favorable than I think we had thought, and Q4 was less favorable. And the Q4 was less favorable in large part because the balances behaved just a little bit differently, and the rate paid behaved just a little bit differently. And the mix or rotation, if you like, that behaved a little differently. It kind of makes sense because Q4 is where QT kind of kicked in. So look, we don't have a great deal of precedent. It's obviously a historic period. It's difficult to forecast quarter-to-quarter, and it's -- our models are just a lot more sensitive right now. So I think we're going to try and share with you what we know when we know it, but it's just a more difficult environment at this point to predict looking forward. It is. It's like the first half of your round of golf, you played well, you should have just stopped after then, I guess. But I guess, as we look -- so in other words, that $400 million extra that you got, you're kind of giving back here from the fourth to the first quarter. So $14.4 billion NII guide. If you annualize that, that would be still 9% NII growth in 2023. Is that a fair starting point? Can you give us not big confidence, but a little confidence given that deposits have stabilized, the day count cards are seasonally lower. So again, if you analyze that, that's 9% NII growth. And then, Brian, still on expenses, any change there? Are you going to keep it to just like 1.5% growth? On the first thing, Mike, you -- it was something I was going to pick up on earlier to the first question. You picked up -- going to the point. We will have growth in NII year-over-year in the range you talked about if you take the $14.4 billion. As Alastair said, we expect it to sort of be less variability and annualize that, compare that to '22 of 9% as you said. So you're exactly right. So that's good growth. And I think you'll see, as you move through the year '23, leave aside the economic scenario playing out. But you'll see -- you'll move from where we are today, which is uncertainty about where the balances will finally settle in and the plateauing of those balances to where you get back to normalized growth and normalized loan growth, et cetera. So you've got it right. There'll be nice NII growth year-over-year. On expenses, if you look at your guys' estimates for us, 62.5, which is what we sort of said earlier this -- in the fourth quarter, we're comfortable with that. That's what the average of the Street analysts are -- and that -- but that takes a lot of good management to get there, and we'll continue to work on it, letting the headcount drift back down and continuing to invest in things that provide efficiencies. So you've got -- and key to that is the 6 quarters of operating leverage and the idea of continuing that going. And then the last part of the income -- or the EPS is simply your excess capital, which you highlighted. It seems like you're well above your CET1 ratio. So what does that mean for the pace of buybacks and your desire to buy back stock at this price? So we've always said that the first desire is always to support business growth, and that's what we've been doing. We then -- we're well above our minimums. We're on a path to close out the requirements for next year. And so we bought back a chunk of shares this quarter. You expect that to start to increase, neutralizing employee issuances and then going above that each quarter now because we -- 11.2-something percent -- we were close to 11.4% target. So we're back in the game. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Alastair, I know we're asking you to predict a lot of things here. Just thinking about the credit and the pace of normalization, do you have any sense of where charge-offs kind of might start out the year? And what kind of pace of normalization, if we look at the charge-off ratio that moved up a little bit this quarter, what might that look like for 2023? Yes. So we're not going to look too far into the future, John. But if you look at our 90 days past due in the credit card data that we show you every quarter, that tends to give you a pretty good leading indicator of what's coming down next quarter. So you can see the 90 days past due have picked up just a little bit. 30 days past due have picked up just a little bit. We're still well below where we were pre-pandemic, but that would tell you on the consumer side, it looks like it's drifting just a little higher. So that's number one. Number two, with respect to commercial, this quarter was a little unusual. We had 3 deals that we ended up having to charge off. Not correlated in any way. They're in totally different businesses, and they've been hanging around for a while, but it was -- 2 of them are fully reserved. So that didn't come as a surprise. But I think because the commercial stuff was so close to 0, it immediately looks like a pop in any given number. That's part of the reason why we showed those graphs of what charge-offs have looked like over time in the earnings materials. But the commercial portfolio continues to look very strong. Okay. And you touched on this a little bit on Brian's comments, but just on loan growth, what are you guys thinking about for this year? And what's the perspective of where you closed the spigots a little bit in the third quarter as you managed RWA? You kind of said those were opening up in the fourth, but we didn't really see it translate to robust loan growth. Just kind of that dynamic between what you're looking to do and what you're seeing on demand for loan growth outlook. Yes. So we said we're wide open for business in the fourth quarter, and that remains the case. Brian covered the capital point. We had to do what we had to do in the third quarter. We did it. We've added 75 basis points of capital in the last 2 quarters, puts us in a great place. So mainly what you're seeing in Q4 is just it was a slower environment for loan growth. A year ago, we were talking about the fact we anticipated that loan growth might be high single digits, and we grew 10. This year, we feel like it's going to be mid-single digits, it's going to be slower. And it's going to be led by commercial, it will be led by card, but things like securities-based lending, that's just quieter. We've got balances being paid down there. Mortgage is quiet through this year. And then in our base case, you look at the economic blue-chip consensus, you can see the forecast is for a recession. So it will be a quieter loan growth year this year, I suspect, but we're open for business to support our clients. We'll go next to Erika Najarian with UBS. I just had one compound clarifying question. The first is, Brian, did you, in response to Mike's questions on NII, bless $57.6 billion in NII for '23, right? He was saying $14.4 billion times 4% or 9% NII growth. You seem to be going with it. I just wanted to confirm that. I think there's a bit of confusion given that you guys were saying you don't want to go beyond the first quarter. And the second question is also for you, Brian. I think that you've done an unbelievable job at transforming the company. And I think the one thing that remains is that the investor base still thinks you as mostly a bank to invest in when rates are going up, right? And clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty over the NII outlook. But could you sort of give us what we should be potentially excited about that you can control with regards to the revenue trajectory from here? And also you spent so much time on deposits. I'm just kind of confused on the message in terms of deposit declines from here because you laid out this case that you have this very resilient deposit base, and it seems like a lot of attrition has already happened. So that -- sorry, that was actually 3 questions in one. I apologize, but that's it. I think I'll put all those questions together in one answer. If you go to the page that's in the report where we sort of say, look at the difference between the consumer business in '19 and now. And it's something to be excited about because we have -- during a period of time where we were completely shut down in branches, like 2,000 opened back up. We actually went down from 4,300 branches to 3,900 branches. We built out in a lot of new cities. We still have work. We have 10% more checking accounts. The customer favorability is an all-time high. Our small business part of that business is the biggest in the country and growing. And you look at that, and that provides a great anchor, which provides a great stable deposit base. We showed you on the slide where we showed that base. It also provides a lot of very low-cost deposits. And as rates rise and materialize that. And then if you think what happened last cycle, for a year when rates did not move up, we continue to grow deposits in the consumer business in the mid-single digits, which just is infinite leverage. And so that's something to be excited about from not only a customer side, where we're digitized and Zelle usage is going up. Erica usage is going up, Erica, meaning our Erica, not you, Erika. But the -- and the balance of the consumer investments, opened up 7% more accounts in a year where investment world was choppy. And then you pair that into the wealth management business, same thing, one of the biggest deposit franchise in the country. Biggest -- 3-point-something trillion, high $3 trillion of assets, growing net households at the fastest rate it's grown in a long, long time, maybe history, growing advisers. Those are things to get excited. That's the organic growth engine in the company. You got to put that against the backdrop of a plateauing of NII, which is basically what Alastair said, sort of think about less variability around the $14.4 billion starting number, which Mike analyzed and did math. And so he did the math and made it out, but that provides us a good base of which to drive forward. And so you really got to get through the economic uncertainty, and then all those things will start to bear. Meanwhile, the trading business, which we invested in a couple of years ago now is at its best fourth quarter ever, and Jimmy and the team are doing a good shape. And so I -- we just feel good about the overall franchise, more customers, more of each customer, and then that provides a big stable base, which as rate increases slow down, the marginal impact of it will slow down until we see the good core loan and deposit growth, which you saw after rate -- the last rate rising increase stopped and produced the 20 quarters of operating leverage -- and things like that. So that's pretty good to be excited about. Biggest bank growing its franchise [indiscernible] growing solid economy in the world at a faster rate than anybody else is pretty interesting. Just to clarify, Brian, you mentioned the plateauing of NII and then, hopefully, all the investments in the business will drive growth from there. Is that still possible if we have continued rate cuts through 2024? The scenario of rate cuts and rate rises, we basically use blue chip. So I'm not sure. It depends on what's causing that. So if it's a normalization of the rate curve back to say, 3% on the front end, 4.5% at the back end or something like that. That's different than what you saw when they had to cut rates for the pandemic or after the financial crisis and left in there for years to get the engine of the United States economy restarted. What's different this time, frankly, and that's what we're talking about the consumer data is even with strong rise in interest rates, a less tight labor market and inflation and what people are being told to worry about, you're actually seeing consumer spending consistent with a good 2% growth environment, a low inflation environment, which is good because the consumer is being appropriately conservative right now. Erika, the other thing I'd just say is you think about why we've got a slowdown in some of our fee-based businesses right now, it's because rates have risen so quickly, and that's created a lot of volatility and it's created -- the asset management business, it's had a sell-off in bonds and stocks. So we're poised now in a lower base where we can grow from here. Same thing, if you look at our net income, we've really outrun a pretty historic decline in investment banking fees. So we got a diversified set of businesses where as some normalcy returns, we can see some pickup in those fee lines as well. We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. I wanted to follow up, Alastair. You had about $800 million of incremental interest income from the securities book. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand, how much of that was attributed to the continued benefit from the swap portfolio? And also then how would you expect that to impact your outlook for the $14.4 billion in the first quarter guide? Yes. So most of the increase in securities portfolio, we're not really reinvesting in there at this point as the securities portfolio started declining. We're using the money that's throwing off to put it into loans. That's always our first preferred place. So you're picking up on the right thing. It's mainly the treasuries that are in there. They're swapped to floating. That way, we don't have any capital impact from rising rates. And so you're going to see the securities yield just continue to pick up, number one, based off of the treasuries swap to floating as floating rates go higher; and number two, as the securities come due, there'll be fewer and fewer of them at lower rates. And so you're going to see the pickup over time. And just as a follow-up, what's our best benchmark rate to kind of watch that trajectory for how we can understand that helper from that swap portfolio? Normally, it's SOFR, secured overnight financing rate. Okay. Great. Second quick one, just on capital. You had 20 basis points increase in your CET1. You did $1 billion or so of the buyback. Just wondering how you're thinking about capital return with the bar package of rules still ahead of us going forward. Well, I think Brian said the right things. The strategy hasn't changed. We've got to, number one, support our clients; we're going to, number two, invest in our growth. Then we plan to just sustain and grow our dividend and over time, we'll balance building capital and buying back shares. I think the difficult part with Basel III endgame right now is we don't have the rules. So we got to wait, I think, until we see those. They'll go through a comment period. At that point, we'll offer much more perspective. But I'll say the obvious, banks have got plenty of capital. We were asked to take 90 basis points more in June. There's a lot of procyclicality already in things like the stress test and stress capital buffer and in CECL. And I think, look, we've shown our ability to perform and build capital, in this case, 75 basis points in 2 quarters. So we'll deal with whatever the ultimate rules come out with. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Have you guys thought about how to better insulate yourself against potentially lower rates? And not just kind of a little bit of a decline, but if we get something unusual and rates drop a lot. I know it's easier for some of the smaller banks to do it, but we have seen some regional banks essentially kind of lock in a corridor of the NIM so that kind of medium term, it's more about growing the balance sheet versus the rate moves up and down. And clearly, with your deposit rates low, if we do get Fed cuts, there's just not as much leverage to bring down those rates. Yes. So I don't know that we've thought about it in terms of like a corridor of NIM, but we definitely think about balancing earnings and capital and liquidity through the cycle. So I don't see us making significant changes to our core. We're trying to make sure that we operate and deliver in all rate environments. That can be high or 2 years ago, it can be 0 rate environment. So the changes -- you can start to see our changes at the margin. You can see we're taking securities out and replacing them with loans, and you can see everything restriking higher. So we've got a smaller, more efficient balance sheet. We, at the margin may consider fixing some rates here depending on how things develop over the quarter. But it's -- we've had a pretty, I'd say, good strategy that's allowed us to drive net interest yields. You can see those on Page 16. They're up 46% over the course of the past year and drive the NII. That's up $3.3 billion year-over-year. So we feel like we struck that balance. That's what responsible growth means to us. And at the margin, we'll probably still maintain a little bit of asset sensitivity. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. Great. Two questions. One, just a little more color on the loan growth outlook. I heard you on expecting that loan growth will be slowing as you go through the year. And I just wanted to get an understanding of -- is that more just demand slowing base effects? Or is there also anything in there from you on proactive credit decisioning as normalization comes through the rest of the year? That's a couple of things. If you look in the fourth quarter, you can see the cards come up, which seasonal, and that's going to come down, and that's one of the things that -- people tend to pay those down. The usage of those cards frankly, are still at low levels. The pay rate, the way to think about that, still in the 30s. So that's sort of one thing that's been kind of consistent through the pandemic. The customers are paying down the card balances. And you expect at some point, those will get back to more normalized paydown rate in the mid-20s. The second is line usage, frankly, has also come back down. It's not gotten ever back to where it was pre-pandemic, and it moved up and it dropped by 100 or so basis points, which across a lot of lines, is a fair amount of loans. So that you saw. And so how corporates manage their borrowing and cash and demand cycle seems to be flattening out a little bit. Then obviously, acquisitions and things are way slowed down, so there wasn't much activity there. So I think you put it together, then you have -- in the securities-based business, customers took down leverage, paid off a fair amount of loans in the wealth management business, even though they've grown, I think, for 50-some quarters in a row now or something like that in loan balances. This happens -- mortgages, obviously, are low. So -- but what we think is as the rate environment settles in, you'll see that normalize and that we'll get -- we'll be back on the mid-single digits. We just won't have the 10% loan growth year-over-year because that is faster than economy and faster than we do. We have not changed credit underwriting standards. And you can see that in the consistency of the origination standards back in pages the appendix where we show sort of our cards and home equity and things like that. It's just the demand side is a little soft because people are reading the same headlines we're all reading about, a recession is coming and what should -- and they should be careful. Okay. Got it. And then on the expense side, I know we talked a lot about the NII and the puts and takes as you go through the year that you're looking for. What about stability on the expense line to manage through any worse-than-expected outcomes on the NII? What kind of levers do you think you have to pull there, Brian? Well, we always have -- the variable compensation stuff will drop because -- assuming that the reason why rates are going -- being cut is because economic activity is worse than people thought. And then you have the general just efficiency movements in the house that we've been pretty good at. And then you have to remember, we try to get people to go off of nominal expense to operating leverage. And so we have 6 quarters of operating leverage. As NII growth slows down, we have to manage a company to produce operating leverage. And so we'd expect that fees might stabilize and absorb the $1 billion downdraft in quarterly investment banking fees and start to work up from there and other types of things. So I think we feel very good about the ability to find ways to manage expenses, always have. We slowed down hiring as we came into the fourth quarter, not because we're -- because frankly, we were -- we've gotten our hiring to match the Great Resignation earlier in the year, and it was sort of overachieving. So we slowed that down, and that will allow us to get back in line and start to bring the headcount back down to where we want it to be. But those are, frankly, positions that are relatively -- that have a relatively high movement rate, and only because of the nature of the job. So we feel good about -- between variable rate compensation -- between continuing to reduce headcount for efficiency and frankly, just activity levels. In a down scenario, we'll be able to pull the expenses down. But yes, meanwhile, we're going to invest $3.7 billion in technology development in '23 versus $3.4 billion in '22. We continue to add bankers. We added 800 wealth management advisers in the second half of last year. We're -- our training program for those across wealth -- all our wealth management businesses and other training programs. We continue to hire young talented people. So we're trying to maintain that balance of continuing to invest in the growth and opening in new cities. We're averaging -- these branches we're opening are extremely successful when you look at the size of them relative to anybody else's opening practice. And so why would you just stop that? And yet the total number of branches comes down because we're managing the expense side. So we're paying for this stuff as we go. But -- and so you could slow some of that down and get leverage out of it. But the question would be, as we're in that scenario, is that the right decision for long-term value creation? We'll go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. A couple of clarifications on the same NII question. I just want to understand, in your assumption about staying at $14.4 billion through the year on a quarterly basis. Are you assuming deposits to continue growing or shrinking? Number one, are you expecting further rotation out of noninterest-bearing to interest bearing? And do you expect the $14.4 billion number even if there are rate cuts towards the end of the year. Is that number doable even with -- what is it that you're assuming? Is it even with rate cuts? So Vivek, we just said less -- there'd be less variability around that number due to the fact the market stuff has gone to 0. That has no impact on it that you saw over the last few quarters have impact. So less variability. All the things you cited are the reasons why we tend to say you have to be careful about saying what's going to happen in the fourth quarter '23 with great clarity. What we did say is at this level, with less variability, you'll have nice growth over this year than next year. But I think everything you point out, whether it's rates going up faster than people think because inflation doesn't go or come down because people think that they've done a good job and they want to get behind the economy. We base our modeling on the blue chip economic assumptions out there and then looking at our balances and stuff. And so I think that's a reluctance. So all your points are great points, and they're all reasons why we are reluctant to say, I can tell you to the 3 decimal places what it's going to be 3 quarters out because it can move around on you. And to Mike's earlier point, we grew $1.2 billion and $900 million in linked quarter, and somehow people thought that wasn't good enough because there's math that could have -- would have gotten you different. So stay tuned and we'll tell you what we know when we know it. And -- but it's good organic customer growth, 1 million net new checking accounts starting at $5,000 balances, growth in wealth management and loans and deposits. These are things that stick with you and will be good no matter what the scenario. Another -- a different question slightly. You gave the $2,000 to $5,000 deposit cohort, Brian, in terms of where they are in the deposit balances. In the past, you've also given a cohort below that, like $1,000 type cohort. Where does -- how is that doing? Can you give any numbers on that? It's similar. It's -- they're all moving down very slightly, that average balance. So that same group of customers taken out, I'd say -- so it's in the same sort of -- different sizing, but it's the same thing. I don't have it right in front of me, but we'll -- I'll have Lee get it to you. But I don't -- but it's moving down slightly. The interesting part of that, Vivek, obviously, is in the highest average balances. You actually have seen them down from pre-pandemic, which means you saw them reposition that in the market. So going to your earlier question, we may have seen a lot of that already take place. But think of them as being down slightly quarter-over-quarter in that cohort. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the program back over to Brian Moynihan for any additional or closing remarks. Thank all of you. Good quarter to finish 2022, and thank you to our teammates for producing it. We continue to grow earnings year-over-year. We have good organic growth and operating leverage for the sixth straight quarter. Those will continue in 2023. The asset quality in the company continues to remain at historic lows relative to any normalized time period in the company's history, including the strong credit performance we had just leading into the pandemic. So our job is now to drive what we can control, which is the organic growth of the franchise, the investments that we make are bearing fruit and also to keep the expenses in good control, and we plan to do that in 2023. Thank you, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."

         "Welcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today with our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, who will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.  I'd also like to come that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP final measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.  I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth quarter results, and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for 2023 before we take your questions. Let me start with fourth quarter highlights. Our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns.  Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both, our commercial and consumer portfolios. And charge-offs have continued to increase but credit quality remains strong.  Our capital levels also remained very strong. And our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well above our required minimum plus buffers. We also continue to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our broad reaching agreement with the CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have been outstanding for several years.  Over the past 3 years, we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement. And many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have more to do, we've made significant progress, and we will continue to prioritize our work here. In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off the great market positions we have.  We are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work. At the same time, we invest in our future. And as I look back at '22, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, early payday making eligible direct deposits available up to 2 days early, extra day grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. And in the fourth quarter, we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds.  Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout has been smooth and though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, our account with no overdraft fees.  We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We continue to improve our credit card offerings including launching 2 new cards, Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. Our new products helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, while we continued to maintain strong credit profiles. We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses, to provide a more comprehensive, relevant and integrated offering for our clients.  We continue to enhance our partnership within our commercial business to bring corporate and investment banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market clients. Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience, which has improved customer satisfaction. In 2022, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. We launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for customers to invest with the streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investments and total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago.  We completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized, convenient and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year. Last month, we announced Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs.  Over the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramps up in group product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code. We're implementing a cloud-native operating model that allows us to innovate faster.  We've also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end to end. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital transformation. We also continue to evaluate our existing businesses. As we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a more focused home lending business, aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals and families and minority communities.  This includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio. I'm saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis, and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability, returns and serving minority communities, not volume or market share.  The mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us, but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or services -- servicers in the industry to do this effectively. Across all of our businesses, we must evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved. And while it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing us will actually -- this will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term.  Changing gears now, I'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social and governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns to shareholders, and we provide many examples on Slide 2 of our presentation. So let me just highlight 2 examples here. We published our first diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our DE&I initiatives. We'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE&I into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, which [ will be ] joining Wells Fargo in 2023 to lead our home lending business and was named the company's new Head of diverse segments, representation and inclusion in the fourth quarter.  We've commissioned an external third-party racial equity audit, and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year. 2022 is a turning point in the economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal.  We are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing and demands for goods and services, but at this point, the impact of consumers and businesses has been manageable. And though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially -- I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward.  Our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels. While we're not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one, and we are stronger company than 1 and 2 years ago. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher. We're better managed, and our capital position is strong. So we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict.  We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements. 2 years ago, we shared a path to higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in the second half of '22 impacted our results, our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns.  In a moment, Mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute. While we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control and infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary.  I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Thank you, Charlie. And good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 summarize how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion or $0.67 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included $3.3 billion or $0.70 per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters, including litigation, regulatory and customer remediation.  $1 billion of impairment of equity securities or $749 million after noncontrolling interest, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business, primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector. Both, slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations.  It's important to note that even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above the amount of the initial investment. $353 million of severance expense, primarily in home lending. While we've reduced headcount in this business throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week.  These reductions were partially offset by $510 million of discrete tax benefits related to interest and overpayments in prior years. We highlight capital on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the benefit from our fourth quarter earnings, the annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching contribution and an increase from AOCI.  Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. While we have not repurchased any common stock since the first quarter of 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of this year.  Turning to credit quality on Slide 7. Credit performance remained strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time, as the federal needs to take actions to combat high inflation.  Credit performance remains wrong across our commercial businesses with only 6 base points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased $88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio but remained slightly below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Nonperforming assets increased 1% from the third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased $397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a less favorable economic environment. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards.  Let me highlight trends in 2 of our portfolios. The size of our auto portfolios declined for 3 consecutive quarters and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago which reflected credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates.  Of note, our new vehicle originations surpassed used vehicles in the fourth quarter, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth.  Turning to the commercial real estate office portfolio. The office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being disciplined in our underwriting standards with both, outstanding balances and [indiscernible] down compared to a year ago.  On Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and $3.1 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio.  I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago, 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we saw declines in each of our business. Lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash in higher-yielding alternatives, particularly in wealth and investment management and continued consumer spending.  As expected, our average deposit cost increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs are up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time.  As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to continue. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Fourth quarter net interest income was $13.4 billion which was 45% higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. I'll provide details on our '23 expectations later on the call.  Turning to expenses on Slide 10. The increase in noninterest expense from both, a year ago and from the third quarter, was driven by higher operating losses. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the December 2022 CFPB consent order.  As part of that settlement, we agreed to 1 incremental remediation and 1 new remediation related to overdraft fees. The accrual related to these 2 remediations was approximately $350 million. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions and reflecting these accruals, our current estimate of the high end of the range of reasonably possible losses and accessible for legal actions as of December 31, 2022, is approximately $1.4 billion.  This is down approximately $2.3 billion from September 30, 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation resolved, this estimate would be the lowest level since the second quarter of 2016 though, of course, new matters will arise and existing matters will develop over time. The estimate for December 31, 2022, will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may change. While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past 2 quarters has been significant. They are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb the cost while increasing our CET1 ratio as I highlighted earlier.  Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates. Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees.  The majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth quarter run rate. We continue to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customer are steadily increased. In 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs.  While industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter, they were still up over 330 basis points since the beginning of the year, including mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association. We're at a 26-year low at quarter end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited. And refinance applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago.  Reflecting these market conditions, our home lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging and gain on sale margin or remain under pressure until excess capacity industry has been removed.  As we announced this week, we will be exiting our correspondent business, which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results. Credit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from the year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas as well as lower loan balances.  Personal lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by lower spread compression. While originations grew 19% from the year ago driven by strong consumer demand in investments and the business, we have remained disciplined in our underwriting.  Turning to key business drivers on Slide 12. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32% from the third quarter, with both declines in correspondent and retail and originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago to declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022.  I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto originations. So turning to debit card. Spending was up 1% compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower transaction volume, offset by higher average [ ticket ] size. Entertainment was the only category with double-digit spending while growth -- while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods and [ fuel ] were all down compared to 2021.  Credit card spending increased 17% from a year ago, and while the year-over-year growth rate slowed from the third quarter, almost all categories continue to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but we're still well above pre-pandemic levels.  Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 78% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities, partially offset by loan growth. Average loan balances were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, while growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by higher [ line ] utilization. Utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year.  Average loan balances have grown for 6 consecutive quarters and were up 5% in the third quarter, with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory, which are still below pre-pandemic levels. Growth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients, including both, new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller customers.  Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 22% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved lending results. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries.  Commercial real estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago driven by stronger lending results to a higher loan balances and the impact of higher interest rates. Markets revenues increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates and commodities, foreign exchange and municipal products.  Average loans grew 10% from a year ago after growing for seventh consecutive quarter, average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago, as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the decrease in market valuations.  The majority of [ win ] advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so asset-based increased slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Even as loan growth in securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility in the interest rate environment, average loans grew 1% from a year ago.  Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Both, revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust business in Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net gain of $943 million.  Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments, equity securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago was driven by higher operating losses.  Turning to our expectations for '23, starting on Slide 17. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. We are assuming that -- we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Moving from left to right on the waterfall based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022.  However, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these declines, partially offset by modest loan growth. We also expect a headwind for lower CIB Markets net interest income due to higher funding costs. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small.  Putting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing in the loan demand.  Turning to our 2023 expense outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $57.3 billion in noninterest expense in 2022, which included $7 billion of operating losses. Excluding operating losses, expenses would have been $50.3 billion, which is -- which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year. If you also exclude operating losses from the guidance, our 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense.  However, revenue-related expenses were lower than expected by market conditions. So we believe a good starting point for discussion for -- of 2023 expenses was $50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by approximately $1 billion due to both, merit increases, including inflationary pressures and an approximately $250 million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge.  These increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately $100 million of lower revenue-related expense, primarily driven by decreases in [ loan ] lending. Based on current market levels, we expect revenue-related expense in Wealth and Investment Management for 2023 to be similar to 2022. We've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves over the past 2 years and through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional $3.2 billion of gross expense reductions in 2023.  A piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more focused home lending business but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized.  We highlighted on this slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year, and we believe we'll have more opportunities beyond 2023. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work separate from our efficiency initiatives. And we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work.  And while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and expect approximately $1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our [indiscernible] growth across the company and better serve our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year.  So putting this all together, expenses, excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 compared with 2022, even with inflationary pressures, a higher FDI surcharge and increase incremental investments in our businesses.  As 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict, and therefore, we have not included them in our expense outlook for 2023. However, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related operating losses, such as fraud, theft and other business as usual losses to be approximately $1.3 billion this year, which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we had an outstanding litigation -- have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses.  It's important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. This remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix.  Given how critical continuing to invest [indiscernible], on Slide 19, we provide details on our primary areas of focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the investments we started to make in digital payments, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make improvements for both, our consumer and commercial customers.  We also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage and investment banking, commercial banking and wealth and investment management and to continue to transform our technology platforms, including moving more applications to cloud, consolidating our data centers and increasing investments in cyber.  Finally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience, but also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk and drive [ an account ] growth. As we show on Slide 20, in the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE, but as I highlighted at the start of the call, our fourth quarter results were impacted by several notable items, including higher operating losses, elevated impairments of equity securities, severance and discrete tax benefits.  As we show on this slide, you will -- if you exclude these notable items, our fourth quarter ROTCE would have been approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding, penalties, mix and pricing, Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels. If rates, funding balances, mix and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher, our ROTCE would be lower. Depending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different answer. So to be clear, because the interest rates are higher and freight costs are lower than our longer-term expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns.  On Slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns. Since we first discussed our ROTCE goal in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020, we have executed on a number of important items. We executed a $20 billion of gross common stock repurchases, $16 billion in net issuances including our 401(k) plan. We increased our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share. We delivered approximately $7.5 billion of gross expense saves and reduced headcount by 11% since the end of 2020.  So we've made good progress over the past 2 years on things that we can control, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher-returning products and businesses. Adding more focus on our home lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted earlier.  While some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns. And our goal is for our 4 operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers.  In summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income and our expenses, excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses to drive growth.  Both, our credit performance and capital levels, remained strong in the fourth quarter. And we expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question of today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Mike, just a follow-up on the NII outlook for the year. So you obviously had a good high end to the year at 13.5% FTE. And just looking at what the guide implies a step down -- a little bit of a step down from thereafter. Can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect the betas to move through and then like what doesn't necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the moving parts? Yes. Sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. I'll just kind of walk you through some of the drivers there. And then obviously, also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well. And so as you look at the key things, you look at stick loan growth, we've got -- we're expecting kind of low to mid-single-digit loan growth throughout the year. So not super fast pace, but at a moderate pace of loan growth.  We are expecting some moderate declines across the deposit base, stabilizing later in the year, but some moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters. And then we would expect the betas to continue to move up a little from here. And then when you think about the pacing of it, the first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year, if all of these things play out.  And so you shouldn't expect a really big step down in the first quarter for sure. And then I think that provides the opportunity potentially in the second half of the year if things -- if we don't see that step down in deposits or the betas are a little bit better than what we expected. And then I'd just point out is even as we looked at the fourth quarter, betas were a little bit better than what we had modeled.  And so we're all in a little bit of uncharted territory here, but I do think that there's some opportunity potentially in the second half of the year as we look at the forecast, but it will be dependent upon how we fare over the next quarter or 2. Okay. Got it. And so second question, I heard your commentary about the $1.3 billion of op losses and the fact that the RPO is down to way down to $1.4 billion. Just how do you kind of help us understand your range of confidence? Obviously, last year, op losses ended at $7 billion as you made progress. So how wide the range of expectations around your confidence on that level of op loss for the year? Well, I think if you look at what we've said over the last quarter or 2, there's been roughly in the third and fourth quarter [ 200, 250 ] just BAU op losses that have happened, just broad normal stuff that you should expect to continue. So that gives you sort of a bottom end. And then I think the rest of it is -- will be a little dependent upon how we work through the rest of the issues that we've got to work through for next year.  But I think as you look at the RPL going from $3.7 billion to $1.4 billion, as those big items have moved to be more probable and estimable for us, we booked them. And hopefully, that gives you confidence that we're putting some of the big things behind us. But we still have stuff to work through, and there'll be more over time, I'm sure. But we've put a lot of big things behind us. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. I think maybe a question along the same lines there. So the tone around the regulatory issue certainly sounds better than like 90 days ago and that reasonably possible losses seems to have a better quantitative thinking as well. But what -- maybe Charlie, what are the major touch points sort of on your plate right now? I know all roads ultimately lead to lifting of the asset cap, but maybe would be curious to hear your thoughts on just sort of the biggest things left in your mind. Yes. Well, let me just -- so listen, we still have a series of consent orders, of which, and I always point this out, the asset cap is a piece of one of them. So all roads don't lead to the asset cap. The roads in this respect lead to us building the proper control environment, which will satisfy ultimately all the consent orders. And I've tried to be clear that we are making progress on that work.  It is a lot to do. And our tone hasn't changed relative to the confidence in the progress that we're making there. So we're going to continue doing it. And hopefully, it's done to the satisfaction of the regulators, but they'll have to decide that. And as we continue to tick off the to-dos on that work, the control environment gets better and better. And we become a better run company that doesn't have those kinds of operating losses that you've both seen in the past. Okay. All right. Perfect. And then, Mike, when you talk about resuming share repurchases in the first quarter, maybe you can give us sort of a sense for sort of magnitude and maybe just an even higher level sort of how you get comfortable repurchasing in the face of what same sort of still uncertain rules out there. Well, I would start with where our CET1 ratio is at the end of the year at 10.6%. So we're well above our current regulatory minimum and the buffers that are included there. So we have plenty of flexibility regardless of any outcome that comes out of the new rules that will be proposed. And keep in mind, that will take some time to come out and get implemented and phase in. And so there's -- it's not going to happen in a day.  And I think we'll go back to what we've been saying the last number of quarters as we think about the buffer that we'll put on the reg minimum, buffers of 9.2%, we'll be managing somewhere in the 100, plus or minus, a little basis point range.  And depending on what happens with loan growth and RWA growth that we see in the quarter, that will help guide the share repurchases. The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Mike, I wanted to clarify your answer to Ken, about the first quarter NII. I think you said you do not expect a big step down in the first quarter. Maybe you could just frame first quarter NII a little bit for us relative to the [ 13.4 ] What are some of the headwinds, tailwinds? And what might you expect at this point? Yes. Thanks, John. Well, first, you have to normalize for a couple less days in the quarter. So that's going to be a step down of, call it, $150 million to $200 million step down just there from the [ flex ] days. And then as you look at -- it should be relatively stable to the fourth quarter, but there could be some -- little bit of [indiscernible] room in there. Stable minus including the day count or... You got to take the day count -- adjust for the day count. And then stable. You have to -- reducing for the day count. Okay. Got it. And then, Charlie, maybe a bigger question, just kind of where are you on the efficiency journey when we think about $50 billion of core expense for this year. And the timeframe for ROTCE, what will it take? Is there an efficiency ratio we should keep in mind? Or is that too hard to forecast? Maybe a little bit on that would be helpful. No, it's a good question. I think -- so first of all, I think when -- just make a -- just a couple of comments around the expense guidance we gave. Embedded in that expense guidance, we're still continuing to reduce the core expenses of the company. But as you can see on that slide, we're anticipating that we will spend more money on investments that are around technology, digital, building out products and things like that, that offset that some extent to get to an overall flat expense base. Mike did say in his comments, and I just want to repeat it, that we're not going to spend this money at all costs.  We're going to see how the year continues to pan out. It's money that we would like to spend. We're planning to spend it, but there's a lot of discretion in the expense base. So we think it's prudent as we sit here today to plan to spend it, but we're going to constantly be looking at our performance and make judgments on what that should be. And so as we look at the efficiency of the company, we do expect to continue to get efficiency ratio improvement in the place.  And if we don't see revenue growth and if we don't see payoffs from the things that we're doing, then we will spend less money. And so that's the way we're approaching it. We're either going to get the efficiency ratio to continue to improve because we're getting real payoff on some things, or we will reduce on a net basis.  But overall, there's still gross expenses that should come out of the company, which gives us the latitude to continue to grow the investments inside the company. The timing to get to 15%, listen, it's a great question. As we talked about it, it's medium term, which is obviously not long term or short term. But I would say it's -- without putting a specific timeframe, it is -- it should be something that we have in our sights as we look out over the future.  It's not something that's theoretical. It's something that we believe we should get to. And just the problem and we're just trying to stay a little bit away from quantifying exactly where we're starting from just because everyone will make their own adjustments.  And it's just, I think what we're just trying to do is be really clear that we don't want to take credit for the outperformance in NII. We don't want to take credit for the outperformance in charge-offs, and that we still have to continue to drive improved performance each and every year at the company. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. So Charlie, I was hoping to ask a follow-up to that last line of questioning around expenses. You indicated that the expense work, it's going to continue beyond 2023, in the 1 metric that we've been tracking is headcount. And in terms of the benchmarking analysis that we've done, headcount is down more than 10% since the 2020 peek or roughly 30,000, but it's still elevated versus your money center peers. I was hoping you could just speak to what inning you're in currently in terms of optimizing headcount. And whether -- as we look beyond '23, whether there is a credible path to actually driving investments lower, you had talked about balancing investment with the need to drive those efficiency gains. I just want to think about the expense trajectory beyond '23, whether further reductions are achievable given some of that inflated headcount still? Yes. Listen, I think -- I mean, I think that your point on headcount versus peers is one that we've made. And so yes, we are all different in terms of the businesses that we're in and what we do. But we do -- and some insource and some outsourcing things. But when you look at it, we still have higher headcount and higher expenses than people who are more complex than us. Some of that is explained by the work that we're doing and the expenses and heads that are building out the control infrastructure. But there's a lot more beyond that. That's the work that we're doing to peel that back piece by piece by piece. We still have a huge amount of manual processes inside the company.  We have duplicate systems, and that is -- that's the work that we're on. So when I say that we still have gross expenses to be reduced in the company. We -- there's -- that's exactly what we're talking about. On the -- the question is when we get to a net basis, where does that come out? As I said before, I think that's a decision that we want to be able to make at each and every point in time when we look at what the overall performance of the company is.  So again, I just want to repeat what I said, we're not going to spend under any environment, at all costs. That's not the way we're thinking about it. If we don't see net improvements in performance of the company, we've got the ability to ration back the discretionary spend so that we do continue to see improved performance of the company. What we'd like to see is that these things are paying off.  We're seeing real sustainable revenue growth based upon these things and the ability to invest. And so that's just kind of how -- that's the framework that we're using to make the decisions. And as we get to each point in time, and it's not even just an annual decision, I mean, Mike and I and the operating committee are going to have these discussions regularly about how are things panning out? What does it look like? And how do we feel about our willingness to continue to invest in these things? And have it -- it's got to be living and breathing. That's helpful color, Charlie. And for my follow-up, just also as it relates to the discussion around the buyback. You guys are uniquely positioned in that you aren't migrating into a higher G-SIB bucket. Because of the asset cap, you're not going to necessarily see quite as much expansion in terms of balance sheet. And you've conveyed a high level of confidence around a 15% ROTCE, where your stock is trading today, at least on price intangible reflects a pretty healthy degree of skepticism and your ability to get there.  Just given the strength of your capital position, why not get a bit more aggressive with the buyback here? Just recognizing the significant amount of capital you'll generate, some of the concerns around AOCI seem to be abating. Would be helpful to get some perspective as to whether you might be willing to step it up meaningfully closer to 100% [ type ] payout here? Well, so just -- it sounds like you're drawing conclusions to the pace at which we said we're going to buy stock back, which I don't think we have actually said. What we've said is that we haven't been buying stock back. We're absolutely -- we anticipate we're going to begin buying it back. As we think about how much we have available in that capacity, what Mike said was our CET1 went up to 10.6%. Our required minimum buffers are at 9.2%. And we -- it said that we'll manage 100 basis points above the 9.2% plus or minus.  So we do have substantial capacity but the ongoing earnings capacity of the company. And so that is -- that's -- our framework is to target a reasonable CET1 ratio if in the future to raise the levels of capital because of Basel III in-game or whatnot.  We've got earnings capacity to be able to do that, but we do have the flexibility. And now that we've got resolution with CFPB and things like that, to be able to go buy stock back. And we'll be making that decision based upon our views on the value of the stock and the liquidity in the market and things like that. But as we said, we do anticipate we'll be back in -- as opposed to where we've been. Fair enough. More of my effort to assess the cadence and the magnet, but it sounds like you guys are quite comfortable leaning in here. Sure. The next question from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. I wanted to see if you could just give a little bit more color on the net interest income side. Maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the noninterest-bearing deposit mix shift that you think could continue here. How -- it looks like that could be a pretty material offset to your interest rate benefits. So I just wanted to see if you can perhaps talk about that and maybe also help quantify the runoff that you expect to continue on the deposit side in terms of balances overall. Yes, John, it's Mike. I think overall, as I said earlier, we do expect a moderate decline in balances and some more mix shift changes as we go throughout the year. And so you should expect that to continue. And it's all the stuff that should be expected as we're in this environment, and that's what we're seeing. And if you look at each of the businesses, we're seeing it kind of most acutely happen in the wealth business as people move into cash alternatives, out of deposits, and that's what's happening in a lot of wealth management businesses these days as people move that cash around.  And then across the rest of the consumer businesses, it's part people looking for higher yields, but it's also part people spending more. And so you're seeing some of that decline come down as overall balances continue to decline as the stimulus has worn off and people continue to be out there spending. So it's a little bit of a number of drivers there. And I think as I said earlier, the -- as you think about the NII pacing for this year, this first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year, given the trends that we expect to happen. And if those are a little bit better than what we're modeling, then I think that provides some opportunity as we look at the second half of the year. Okay, Mike. That's helpful. And then separately, you gave some pretty good color obviously, around NII expectations now. And then also on expenses. On the fee side, can you perhaps give us your expectation there around overall growth that you expect in noninterest income and maybe some of the major drivers of where you see growth and if you could possibly size it up perhaps around the investment banking area, et cetera, that would help. Yes, sure. And so as you break apart fees, the biggest line item there is the investment advisory fees, and that's going to be somewhat dependent upon where the market goes. So if we start to see recovery in the equity markets at a more substantial pace, that will obviously be a big benefit for that business. When you look at some of the other line items, deposit fees, as I mentioned in my commentary, most of the decline that we were expecting to see as a result of the overdraft policy changes and new products that we implemented is in the run rate. You may see some pressure there related to earnings credit on the commercial side, but the run rate decline for overdrafts is really in there. When you think about investment banking fees, that's going to be somewhat market dependent. We've seen -- it's too early to know how that's going to shape up in terms of the overall industry volume there.  But as we continue to make the investments in our investment banking business over a longer period of time, we would expect to see some growth there, both in how we go after that opportunity in the commercial bank and middle market space as well as our other large corporate clients there. And so a lot of that's going to be dependent on the market. But we're confident that we're going to be positioning ourselves better and better to take advantage of it. And then we talked about mortgage. Mortgage is a small piece of the -- it's a much smaller piece of the puzzle than it was today. So we don't expect that to be a smaller piece today than it was historically. Sorry, smaller piece today than it was historically. And so -- and that's going to be a pretty challenging market until -- in this rate environment. So I think we're confident in the investments we're making that will pay off over time, but it may take a little time to start to see some of that come through depending on the market dynamics. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. I just had one question. I guess, Charlie, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the impact on customers from higher rates, I think you implied it was not getting worse with the incremental sales. Was that the right takeaway? And if so, and if the Fed were to stop after another hike, do you actually see that the impact your customers may not be as meaningful as feared over the last 6 to 12 months and implications of that on the credit quality and the credit performance of your book? Would love to hear any perspective you can share. Sure. What I was trying to say in those remarks was the impact on rising rates is continuing to impact customers on a period-over-period basis, and we would expect that to continue, but it's not accelerating. It's much more linear than exponential. And the fact that it's much more linear is actually a very helpful thing because that gives people -- that's just -- that's a more orderly transition to a slower growth economy and gives consumers a chance.  It shows that they're adjusting their spending patterns and saving patterns and borrowing patterns to adjust for the reality of higher rates. And on your second question, we would anticipate that we would continue to see deterioration in those metrics continue after the Fed stops raising rates, for a period just because of the amount of time that it takes those things to filter through the economy more broadly. So hopefully, that was helpful. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned earlier around commercial real estate. Like are you seeing any stress? There some discussion around the ability of these loans to get refied given the move in rates we've seen over the last year. Any steps within the CRE book? And anything just in terms of home state, a lot of negative headlines around San Francisco. Would love to your perspective on that, too. It's Mike. I'll try to take that and Charlie can add if he needs. When you look at the -- and you're really getting at the office, I think, space more than anything there. There's certainly more stress in the office space than there was a quarter or 2 or 3 quarters ago. And I think you're seeing that. Now it hasn't translated into lost content at this point. And so we're keeping a careful eye on it. And I think it is -- as you look at where you see it most, it is in older, lower class properties. And over 80% of our portfolio is in Class A space.  And so we feel like the quality of it's pretty good, but we will see some stress as we go through here. So far, it's been pretty idiosyncratic in terms of individual buildings and individual places. But we are very watchful on cities like San Francisco, like Los Angeles, like Washington, D.C., where you're seeing lease rates overall be much lower than other cities across the country. And so certainly, those are markets that we're keeping a pretty close eye on and making sure we're being proactive with our borrowers to make sure we're thinking way ahead of any maturities or extensions, options that need to get put in place to help manage through it. The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Just one more clarification question, if I may, on net interest income. Mike, your underlying assumptions to your NII outlook in terms of low to mid-single-digit loan growth, moderate declines in deposit balances in the first half and stabilizing doesn't feel very different from what consensus had been assuming to get to $51.5 billion for '23, which is clearly higher than what's implied by your outlook.  So I'm wondering if I could reask Ken's question, what deposit betas, what terminal deposit betas, what range of expectations are you baking into that $49.5 billion forecast. And did you make a significant amount of conservatism as you think about your NII outlook? And I'm asking that question because one of your peer CEOs said their $74 billion outlook was not conservative. So I think that given the outlook versus consensus expectations, I did have to reask that question here. Yes. No, look, it's... Can I just ask to start on. Mike actually goes to the facts. Again, I think one of the things that you're hearing from all of us that were all very consistent on, which I know you appreciate, but I just want to say it anyway, is we don't know what the rate path is going to look like from here over the next 11.5 months, which is exactly what you're asking and exactly what the competitive environment is going to be month by month versus all of the people we compete with. So you're looking at -- we don't know what the alternative is going to be in nonbank deposits, and we don't know what the alternatives are going to be in bank deposits, but we're trying to make those predictions. So I think when we go through all of this, we're all just trying to, in our own way, make sure that there's clarity that we're -- and I'll speak to myself now.  We're trying to give you what we think is achievable. And in our case, based upon the rate curve that we've laid out in the document, and it might or might not turn out that way. We're also assuming, and I talked about this at a conference in December that we are going to continue to raise rates in which we pay our consumers because we're thinking about this not in terms of maximizing short-term NII, but thinking about it in terms of the value of the relationship and making sure that we pay properly for that, so that we're continuing to recognize how expensive it is to get a new relationship and how profitable it can be to keep an existing relationship.  And so if your views are different towards the end of the year as to what the rent scenario could be, that's fine. Specifically, what we've tried to do, as we've gotten closer to the periods with which we see is give you some clarity as Mike did on what we're -- the first quarter is a little clearer to us. But beyond that, is pretty difficult, and we're not going to go through every last beta that we're assuming in terms of what those forecasts are. Yes. The only thing I'd add to it is as you -- as the Fed does -- when the Fed does ultimately peak in terms of rising rates, you will see a lag on pricing as that will continue -- pricing will continue to increase over a quarter or 2 quarters, 3 quarters really all depends on the competitive environment. So you're going to have some lag there. But I'm sure all of us have our own points of view and assumptions underneath those models. But what we're trying to give you, as Charlie said, is a case that we think is achievable through the year. And as I said earlier on the call, I think if we're -- if we've -- depending on how it plays out over the first and second quarter, we could have some opportunity in the second half. But I think it's unclear exactly how that will play out. So we'll obviously keep you updated as it goes. The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. I did want to just unpack a couple of things around the correspondent exit and also some follow-up questions as it relates to the mortgage business in general there. I think you mentioned that it's not substantial impact. Maybe you could help us understand revenues, expenses, EPS. I made my own assumptions, but I got a lot of questions from people on what managements say. So I would like to understand that piece of it.  And then could you help us understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business once you exit correspondent, is there any originate and sell servicing retained left in any panel? Or are you staying with this correspondent exit -- your exit that you'll be moving entirely to portfolioing for yourself and the MSR will wind down over time? Just give us some color around that, would be appreciated. Yes. So maybe I'll start on the second, and then Mike will circle around to the first. So we are not assuming that we will balance sheet every loan that we underwrite in the future. Again, what we're just -- what we're trying to do in the path that we've laid forward is just to make very clear that we're not interested in running and having a business which is focused on a stand-alone mortgage product. We very much appreciate the importance of mortgage to the consumer base. And we're going to continue to stay in the business.  But we're going to view it as part of the importance in the broader relationship. So that means we'll be originating both, conforming and nonconforming mortgages. And we'll continue to make the decision as to what goes on our balance sheet as we have done in the past. The fact that we'll be originating a lot less will certainly mean that over time, the MSR and the overall servicing book will come down very naturally based upon that, over a fairly long period of time. But we'll also look for intelligent and economic ways to reduce the complexity and the size of our servicing book between now and then. And if those present themselves, we'll certainly be interested in doing that.  And I know Mike will talk a little bit about this, but I think one of the things we were just trying to say when we think about the size of the impact of exiting the correspondent business immediately is given the fact that mortgage volumes are so low and revenues are so low, the revenue impact of exiting the correspondent business in the short term is not meaningful. It's a very small number of people. So that's not all that meaningful in the short term.  The real benefit comes over time as we reduce the size of the servicing business, which, as we've tried to make the point is, it's not just reducing expenses, but it's not profitable for us today in a whole bunch of these segments where we continue to have the servicing. And so it becomes a positive over time. And it's just -- but that is not a short-term benefit for us, but certainly a medium- to longer-term one. Yes. And the only thing I'd add is all you lose initially, Betsy, is the gain on sale on the origination. The servicing is still here. And that in any given quarter over the last couple of years is low tens of millions of dollars. So it's a really small impact. The servicing cost is low tens of millions? The only thing you lose today by exiting correspondent is the gain on sale on the origination of mortgage. The low tens of millions is the gain on sale? Correct. The servicing of the existing portfolio is still here and... Part of the broader servicing dialogue. So there -- because one of the follow-ups I got was it, does it impact the scale? Obviously, it reduces the flow over existing plants. So does that matter to how you price your ... Yes, I mean... No, it's not even close. I mean the amount that we're originating today relative to the scale we have in the business is -- it's immaterial. And we'll -- and even as we downsize the portfolio on the servicing side, the whole point -- our servicing portfolio can be substantially, substantially lower, and we'll still have scale to be able to originate the product. And we would say in a more profitable way than we're doing it today. Okay. And so the remaining mortgage origination channels are 100% retail, is that right? Yes. Okay. Right. Because you're at a wholesale, you're out of correspondent. Yes. That's correct. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Question for you. With the CFPB settlement, there was a comment by the head of CFPB about growth initiatives slowing your progress. So Charlie, just a question to you is what are you planning to do in regards to that comment in terms of the growth initiatives? Are you trying to slow anything? Any color on that? Yes. I addressed it in my remarks, which is we've been very, very clear. And I think if you look back on every earnings call, let alone any time I speak publicly, we're very consistent in making sure that everyone understands both, internally and externally, that our #1 priority is getting that work done. That is how we're running the company. We have very clear processes internally to make sure that, that happens. And we're very confident that's the case. And the things that we are doing to grow the business, we think, are actually helpful to actually making it a more controlled place. And we're going to continue to go forward the same way we've been going forward being very conscious of making sure things don't get in the way. Okay. A completely different question. On -- in the past, you've given some color on deposits and amongst different tiers of customers. Any color, any update on where those stand currently and your outlook on that? It's still very much the same, which is kind of intuitive that those who went in with lower balances are the ones who are living more paycheck to paycheck. And they are seeing more stress than those that have not had that. But I would say that it's the rate of change, it's still the same across most of the affluent spectrum. So the trends are still very consistent. And our final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Charlie, kind of to flip this question from your answers to the servicing and the residential mortgage business. Are there any lines of businesses that -- I know you can't go out and make an acquisition, of course, but any lines of businesses you're looking to grow and enhance and beef up maybe through hiring groups of people to do that strategic increase? Listen, I think when we look at all of the -- I mean, I've said this in the past, when we look at each of these businesses that we have, and that's going to be a consumer bank, it's consumer lending, wealth, commercial and the corporate investment bank. With the exception of the home lending business and that the rest of the consumer lending businesses that land, it's all going to be based upon returns and what we're seeing in terms of market competitiveness.  All of these businesses have the opportunity to continue to grow share. And when we think about the things that we're doing to invest, we are targeting investment banking ads in both, coverage and products. We're focused in commercial banking, the build-out of both, the corporate investment offerings for that customer base, both the corporate investment bank and the commercial bank of opportunities to continue to improve what we do from the treasury services perspective. And so we see growth opportunities there. I've talked about the opportunities in our wonderful wealth management business to bring on some more investment teams as we've reoriented that business.  And when we wind up looking on the consumer lending side, you've seen growth in the credit card side of the business, which we would expect to continue. And our consumer bank is -- we very carefully evolve from fixing the problems that we've had, taking advantage of the franchise. So when we talk about -- and we have this page in the deck, Page 19 in the investor -- in the earnings presentation, we do see multiple places for us to be able to increase the rate of growth by just organically, which sometimes involves adding people. Sometimes it's building technology. Sometimes it's just improved execution. And there are other things like affluent and whatnot that I haven't mentioned, but they're a bunch, and they're pretty broad. Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Mike, you guys mentioned that there was a private equity or equity write-down in the quarter. Can you share with us how big that was? And then just -- I know over the years, you guys have done very well in this area. But -- and then second, how big is the portfolio? What's the remaining there? Sure. It was about $1 billion write-down, $750 million after noncontrolling interests. And so that's on the first page of the release, if you want to refer back. It was primarily driven by some write-downs in enterprise software companies. And in particular, it was really one investment that drove most of it. And I would just point out, we had a -- that investment is still a very good investment. The company is a good investment, and we're still holding it well above where we -- where the invested amount is. Just to be collect, we're holding it at something like still a little under $0.5 billion. Just to be clear, we're holding it at something like still... A little under $0.5 billion. Yes, I would say 10x is what we invested in it. But like all of -- all enterprise software companies, it's the company, it's just -- it's the rate of growth over the next year or so has come down substantially, but it's still a very high-quality company. And then just more broadly, on the venture business, we've done -- the team has done a great job over a very long period of time, and we still think it's a very good business. That was our final question. Okay. Thank you all, and we appreciate the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care, everyone. Bye-bye. Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect."

         "Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations.   [Operator Instructions].  Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Thank you, Jen, and happy new year to everyone joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start 2023. Today, I'll share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter. And then I will take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the coming year.   The global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we enter 2023, environments have had better than we all expected for the time being at least, despite the aggressive tightening by the Central Bank. In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak.   That said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the Eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with. In Asia, while the public health impact in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID-Zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally. And here at home, the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected, in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings.   The Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation, however,  and therefore, we continue to see the U.S. entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year. Now turning to how we performed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of $1.16. Our full year revenue growth of 3% ex divestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor Day, as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an ROTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%. This quarter, our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year, and we're quite pleased with some and less happy with the performance of others.   Services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth. Our markets businesses are navigating the environment very well, and we're seeing good momentum in U.S. Personal Banking. On the flip side, investment banking felt the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in '22 and the environment for wealth remained a challenging one. Unpacking that a bit, services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services.   TTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our global network had revenues up 36% year-over-year as we execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations.   Likewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under administration and custody. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory with revenues up 18% from 2021. We have the #1 FICC franchise on the Street during the first 3 quarters of the year and fixed income was up 31% in the final quarter. Equities was down as the mix of client activity, again, did not play to our strength in derivatives.   With the wallet down significantly, our investment banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline looks more promising and the client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will turn in '23. Wealth Management's performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter, with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum and net new investment flows.   Similarly, we continue to build our client adviser base, albeit at a slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover. In U.S. Personal Banking, both cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly. Whilst in retail banking, we clearly have some more work to do. As you know, we've been actively managing our balance sheet and risk.   Our cost of credit increased in line with our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in anticipation of a mild recession. And in the U.S., net credit losses in cards continue to normalize as we had expected, still well below pre-COVID levels. Corporate credit remains healthy, and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio.   In terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. And finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65, and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our common dividend.   Now let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've already made. We simplified the bank, closing sales of our consumer businesses in 5 markets, including 3 in the fourth quarter. And we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea as well as our franchise in Russia.   We continue to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank. We're streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data. This will make us a better bank. We brought in very strong talent, met our representation goals and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I'm pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year. We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing and announced the findings from an external law firm, which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the U.S.   Finally, I'm very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks, which define 2022 and supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout. Before I hand over to Mark, let's turn to the next few years and in particular, the path to achieving our medium-term return targets that we laid out on Page 5.   At Investor Day, we talked about the past coming in 3 phases, with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined execution and investment. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term shareholder value. We're focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the expectation that our businesses will close out '23 competitively stronger. Services entered '23 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovation and market-leading product capabilities. Markets continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the businesses focused on capital productivity.   Banking and Wealth are well positioned for when the cycle turns, thanks to the investments we've made in top talent and technology as well as the synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the right time to make [indiscernible] and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business.   I asked Jim O'Donnell to take on a new role, focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep expertise and relationships, and when combined with [indiscernible] additional role as North America Head, it's designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market.   U.S. Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery and borrowing, taking full advantage of our market-leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the card space. We will make further progress on our international consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will, of course, focus on our clients, deepening relationship and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy. We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise, including the investments in our transformation and controls. However, we will pace some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment.  Looking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets. We'll do so through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our transformation and further simplification, and Mark will cover this in more detail shortly.   We fully recognize this suppresses our returns in the near term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary to reach our medium-term return targets and to create long-term shareholder value. We are carrying not just our momentum, but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments.   We are running the bank differently with a relentless focus on execution, and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions. Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I'll also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023.   On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16 and an ROTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenue. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impact of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10 with an ROTCE of approximately 5.5%.   In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5% excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across services, market and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking, wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exit. Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year.   Excluding divestiture-related costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5%, largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exit.   Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses, particularly in retail services and an ACL build of $645 million, largely related to growth in cards and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income and an ROTCE.   Now turning to the full year revenue walk on Slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up 3%, excluding the impact of divestitures, in line with our guidance of low single-digit growth. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were up 32%, driven by continued benefit from rates as well as business actions such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments. Higher wins have accelerated due to the investments that we've been making in market-leading product capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 U.S. dollar clearing capability in the industry, the 7-day cash suite product that we launched earlier this year, and instant payment, which is live in 33 markets, reaching over 60 countries.   So while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business action and investments drove the remaining half. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 1% decrease in noninterest revenue due to the impact of market valuation.   For the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins, and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. In markets, we grew revenue 7%, mainly driven by strength in rates and FX as we continue to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital. This was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives. On the flip side, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 39%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity.   In cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continue to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022 along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels. And in wealth, revenues were down 2%, largely driven by market valuations in China lockdown. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 3%. Corporate Other also benefited from higher NII in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in legacy franchises, excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased by about $1.3 billion as we closed 5 of the exit markets and continue to wind down Russia and Korea consumer.   Going forward, we would expect legacy franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit market. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8% in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%, with about 2/3 of the increase related to risk, control, data and finance program. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology.   About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding scalability to our TTS and Securities Services platform, enhancing client experiences across all businesses and developing new product capabilities. We also continue to invest in front office talent, albeit at a more measured pace, given the environment, and volume-related expenses were up 1%, largely driven by market and cards. The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit market.   Across the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year. On Slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets that we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions, including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn't anticipate at Investor Day, impacted some KPIs positively and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy.   In TTS, we continue to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we roll out new product offerings and invest in the client experience, which is a key part of our strategy. Client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments. And these again include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. For the third quarter year-to-date, we estimate that we gained about 70 basis points of share and maintained our #1 position with large institutional clients.   In addition, we've onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chain to address the evolving global landscape. And in Securities Services, we onboarded new client assets, which offset some of the decline in market valuation. And we estimate that we'll gain about 50 basis points of share in Securities Services through the third quarter of this year, including in our home market. In markets, we strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress towards our revenue to RWA card.   In cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both branded cards and retail services. Card spend volumes were up 14%, end-of-period loans up 13% and most importantly, interest-earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like investment banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our market position. And in wealth, while we have brought on new advisers and new client assets, given the impact of market valuation, this didn't translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point.   So in summary,  we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments, and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium term. Now turning back to the fourth quarter on Slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven by services, cards and market.   Average loans were down as growth in cards was more than offset by declines in ICG and legacy franchise. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 1%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average deposits were up driven by growth in ICG and PBWM, and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points.   On Slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit mix. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio is approximately 2.6%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. card is 3.8% and 7.6%, respectively, both just above day 1 CECL level. And we feel very good about the high quality nature of our portfolio. In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that, branded cards makes up 66% and retail services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total card exposure is to prime customers.  And NCL rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels.   In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate nonaccrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That said, we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentration under a range of scenarios. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels.   On Slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 1/4 or just under $600 billion consists of [indiscernible] dollars. And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago. On Slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 [indiscernible] to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter, first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income to common, which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividend, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits, RWA optimization and market moves towards the end of the quarter.   We ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 basis points higher than the last quarter. As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes 100 basis point internal management book. That will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico consumer exit at signing while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients.   And as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by 3% this quarter with TTS up 36% on continued strength in NII; Securities Services revenues up 22%; markets revenue, up 18% on strength in fixed income, partially offset by a decline in equity and investment banking revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume. Expenses increased 6%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, specifically in services and volume-related expenses partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings.   Cost of credit was $56 million, driven by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. ICG delivered a 7.9% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%.  Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 3%, and sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICG grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered approximately $10.7 billion of net income with an ROTCE of 11.1%.    Now turning to Slide 15. We show the results of our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 7%, driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives.   Cost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build, driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs were up, reflecting ongoing normalization, particularly in retail services. Average loans increased 6%, while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 1.4%, driven by the ACL build this quarter and higher expenses.   For the full year, PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in revenue. On Slide 16, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the closing of 5 exit markets as well as the impact of the wind down. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence of divestiture-related impact last year related to Korea.   On Slide 17, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses. On Slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1. We will continue to execute and invest, laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving long-term shareholder value. With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding any potential 2023 divestiture-related impacts, expenses to be roughly $54 billion, also excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact. Net credit losses in cards are expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13% CET1 target, and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close additional exit and announce others.   On Slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023, excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions. And for Securities Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuation and onboarding of additional client assets. We also assume somewhat of a normalization in wealth as lockdowns in China end and market valuations start to rebound. And we expect investment banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity.   As for market, we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022. Now turning to the NII guidance for 2023. We expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow volumes, particularly in cards, and we continue to get the benefit of U.S. and non-U.S. rate hikes in our services business.   As a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes the reduction of revenue from the exit and legacy franchises that we closed in 2022, and we expect to close this year in 2023. Turning to Slide 21. In 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that we've made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are, first, transformation, as we continue to invest in data, risk and control and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient. Second, business-led investments as we execute against our strategy. Third, volume-related expenses in line with our revenue expectations. And fourth, elevated levels of inflation mainly impacting compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exit.  And we are investing in technology across the firm with total technology-related expenses increasing by 5%. While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses, these are investments that we have to make and I am certain that these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future.   And finally, let's talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day, we said the medium term was 3 to 5 years. That time frame represented 2024 to 2026. So while a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11% to 12% ROTCE target in the medium term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reduction and capital levels largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11% to 12% ROTCE target. So let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe, which accelerated NII growth. And that, coupled with the execution of our strategy, has allowed certain businesses to accelerate.   At the same time, other businesses such as wealth and investment banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit. From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium term. And we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The 3 main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exit, which will be included in legacy franchise the benefits from our investments in transformation and control and the simplification of the organizational structure.   First, let me remind you, at this point, the ongoing expenses in legacy franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and wind down, which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature, we expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes, the technology-enabled one. And finally, we remain focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reduction in the future.   From a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future ACL build or releases will be a function of macro assumption and volume. So to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our path to achieve the 11% to 12% ROTCE in the medium term. And Jane, the rest of the firm and I, are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Definitely appreciate all these outlooks. They're very helpful.  So my question on the outlook is if you take a look at the current medium-sized return on tangible and getting to your target. I heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track. Is it the expense spend at the end of '24, that is the material step-up from here to there, if you will, and/or is credit like a really big determinant in the process? So I'm trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from today's return on tangible targets. Yes, sure. Glenn, thanks for the question. So we did give you some guidance here. We gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for '23. And then importantly, when we talk about the medium term, it's both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it's also bringing the expenses down from this '23 forecast. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what's going to bring these expenses down, the combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries will create an opportunity for. And so it's a combination of revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down. The cost of credit is kind of as we've been talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what we've seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we've been managing through. Okay. I appreciate that. Just one quick follow-up on [indiscernible] not my norm, but I normally try to respect this type of process. But Mark, we consider your super important part of this transformation.  There's been news out there that you're talking to [indiscernible].  But would you be able to make any comments? You mentioned [indiscernible]. I appreciate that, Glenn. Citi is an important firm. I'm the CFO of this firm and this strategy is something that I'm focused on with Jane, ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that creates shareholder value for our investors. And so we're committed to getting that done. Together. Together. Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Mark, I wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for 2023. You've got about the midpoint, it kind of implies about 4% revenue growth this year, kind of consistent with what you talked about for that 4% to 5%. So for this year, the 2023 guide, it looks like the NII is guided to be up about 3.5% and the markets you're assuming kind of flat. So what's enabling you to get to the 4%? Where are the drivers that are above 4%? Is it some of those fee businesses? And just a little more color there would be helpful. Sure. So let me make a comment first on the NII. Just keep in mind with that number that I've given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important services businesses, and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year but also expected continue increases, particularly outside of the U.S. And given the make-up of our franchise, we will -- that will contribute to the NII growth. And then keep in mind that we're growing over the legacy franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023.  So underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it would be a slower pace than what we saw in 2022. From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation. And that would play out both in banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with while it's down 50% to 60% as well as some normalization in wealth and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out. Okay. And then -- sorry, if this is clear already. But just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of 2024. Is that going to mean that for the early part of 2024, expenses kind of rise above 2023 and then they kind of peak out plateau towards the back half of '24. Is that how we should envision it? I'm not going to kind of get into '24 guidance. We'll kind of get through '23, and I'm confident about our ability to get to that roughly 54 number that I put out for '23. I'm equally confident that we will bend this curve, and we'll bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the ROTCE target, but I'm not going to kind of get into, John, the specifics of '24 except to say that by the end of '24, we will see that curve bending. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. My first question is -- again, thank you for all the clarification on the slide. Great job, Jane and Mark, obviously. But as we think about what it means to bend the curve, I think your investors are appreciative that you are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation. As we think about when Citi can hit that medium-term ROTCE, how should we think about what's bending the curve really means? And I'm not looking for guidance necessarily, but as we think about going past that hump, what's the better way of measuring? Should we -- is it an efficiency ratio? I think you mentioned something like it is the 60% to 63% efficiency ratio against that 4% to 5% revenue CAGR that you think you'll be able to hit by 2025? Can we think of it that way? Yes. So at Investor Day, we did talk about it, and we remain consistent and committed to that. We talked about getting to an efficiency ratio that's less than 60% in the medium-term period. And so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down. I think the other thing I'd mention just you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important aspects that the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is. The portion that's tied to stranded costs, Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operations.  I think the third piece is that technology, right? And so right now, a lot of what we're doing is manual. And as we continue to invest in technology -- and technology is up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be up 5% next year. That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and that will bring down the operational cost for running the firm. And so those are a couple of examples, I hope, of the how. But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day. And I would say you can get some confidence around the past on many of these by the urgency with which we're executing the divestitures, for example, on getting those transactions closed. And we've also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be closing and the speed of the wind downs that we're executing. So that will help. As Mark said, it's 3 big structural drivers of what will be in that curve. And Mark, I'm sorry, for misspeaking. I was looking at the [indiscernible]. I have like 15 slides open in the computer. The second question, and maybe just Jane, I think that your investors have appreciated your sense of urgency with regards to the divestitures. I think the elephant in the room continues to be, I think, investors sort of expected an announcement on Banamex right now. And I'm wondering if you're still considering just selling Banamex. Or are you thinking about different options on the table, such as an IPO? So we're in active dialogue at the moment. So I'm obviously not going to comment in great detail here. We do continue to pursue a dual path as you'd expect, because both are very viable options here. And when we are in a position to give you clarity but we will do so. I think we've been fairly clear about the timing. We are also separating out the 2 franchises, our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that we're selling because we see the institutional franchise is a very important part of the global network. As you can imagine, in today's environment, Mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains. And we play a very important role there. That is a lot of work in that separation. I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making in that underlying work. But we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. I'm still trying to get over at this revenue and expense guidance. so you're implying you'll have at a minimum flat operating leverage or positive operating leverage for 2023? Am I reading that correctly? So on the one hand, you're not bending the cost curve until late 2024. On the other hand, you're guiding for positive operating leverage in 2023. Am I reading that correctly? Mike, when you do the math, I don't think it will get to the positive operating leverage in 2023. But we are, as you see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line. That growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that 54 number would -- roughly 54 number would suggest but we are on the right track. And we are getting there in a way that's consistent with the strategy that we talked about. And we do feel confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we've put out here similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment. Okay. And then a second follow-up -- or a follow-up, and then I'll requeue for my other question. Your CET1 ratio is 13% now. And I think that's 2 quarters earlier than consensus had expected. You said it was up 70 basis points. So doesn't that allow you to repurchase stock now? Or I understand that if you go ahead and sell Banamex, that could have a temporary negative capital hit. So I'm just thinking like don't sell Banamex, don't have that temporary capital hit, start buying back stock at a fraction of your tangible book value. So what's wrong with my logic or what part of that can you comment on? I'm going to jump in on the don't sell Banamex, Mike. As you could imagine, so we are selling the consumer franchise. It does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. It's an emerging market consumer franchise, and we are clearly focused around the multinational clients and in institutions and high-net worth individuals with cross-border needs as we laid out very clearly and businesses that have strong connectivity across the -- between each other.  So we are -- we don't see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective. And when we run all the math, it is in the shareholders' interest that we sell that franchise and deploy that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns. What you're suggesting is a very short-term move. And I think as you can see from the actions we're taking, we're very focused on our medium and long term and not taking the short-term path that we would regret in the medium and long term. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. I guess just one question as a follow-up on capital. As we think about post the second half of the year, let's say, you've taken the hit from Banamex. But coming out of this test, any sense, Mark, if there's any reason why Citi would have an outsized negative impact from [indiscernible]. Just give us a sense, I'm just wondering hopefully, we don't get another disappointment as we get [indiscernible] buybacks in the back half and there's something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank? Would love any perspective there? Yes. So look, as we pointed out, we've built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year. We are ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year. We do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on that CET1 ratio. And we do obviously have a DFAST that's in front of us that we'll have to see what the outcome is of that work.  I think, look, the [indiscernible] decisions on that are still outstanding. And I think we'll have to take those into consideration when they become available. That is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out. And similar to SACR, we'll get after it in a very significant way to make sure that we're able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that. But it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren't final rules out just yet. Got it. And just back to your medium-term targets. I guess if we hit that bending the curve at the end of '24, it implies that this company should have an earnings power north of $10 by '25 even at the lower end of the guidance. Am I missing anything there? Or like does that make sense? The only thing I'd point out is what we've described -- what I've described, what Jane described is the medium term is '24 through 2026. And we've given you guidance for '23. We intend to get to those return targets in the medium term. I haven't given you specific guidance on any of those individual years, and we'll kind of take that year by year. And so just factor in. I think what's important is you've got a view on '23, and I think we've given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium term, and I think that's important. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. I did want to ask a little bit about the strategy with Personal and Wealth Management. I know Jane, earlier you talked about the fact that -- which you have announced looking for a new head to move that business forward. Could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for growth because there's a bunch of different pieces. Some on the advice channel, some of the more fee channels, some of the more balance sheet piece. And you already indicated U.S. as an opportunity to expand into. So I'd just like to understand, from your perspective, which pieces are the most important to execute on. And that could help us understand how you're planning on shaping this business going forward? Great question, Betsy. And Mark and I are both smiling here because I think the answer is all of the above. So if we break it down, where do we see the various elements of upside? There's an important recovery that's going to occur in Asia. And you can see from our results last year, and across the board with other competitors with an Asian [indiscernible] that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of COVID in that market compared to broadly in Asia compared to the U.S. So we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board.  You're absolutely right, in the U.S., we start from a smaller scale there. We've been bringing the different parts of that business together. The wealth of work franchises, one that's had particularly pleasing growth in it. And we've also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers. The biggest upside there is the investment product. And I think we've got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were, particularly the deposits, some of the margin lending and the like mortgages, but this is really about the investment offering in the States.  Then finally, I'd say there's also tremendous opportunity in the synergies, and we've been showing you this in terms of linkages between our commercial bank, our banking franchise, the referrals up from the U.S. Personal Banking. We've had about 60,000 referrals this year in the U.S. alone. From that, market also provides important results and even TTS. So the client referrals, there are business synergies between them common platforms. So we really see an opportunity for this multidimensional growth drivers in wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from.  And we'll continue investing in appropriately in building out that front line as well. So this is a very important part of our strategy. We're excited about it. It's the key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well, looking at the medium term. And we're looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here. And would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to accelerate from here? Or you've already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as opposed to accelerating? I think, look, in this current environment, as we've said, Mark and I have both said since the -- really, the middle of last year, this is something that we're pacing, but we're continuing to invest behind it. And you can see that growth in our client advisers. And remember, that net growth in client advisers, it includes the divestiture we made in Uruguay, for example. So it's pretty strong. We don't have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place, and it's more been a story of integrating them and then making sure that we're putting the right [indiscernible] other investments behind it, but it's not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business. And we'll pace that as appropriate with market conditions. Mark, anything to add? Betsy, you know this is -- in a normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high-returning business. And we've seen that in the past. And so we want to be well positioned for as the market turns, having brought on client advisers, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions, which were up 24% in 2022. And so I think we're well positioned for that. But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars. And so we'll replace as necessary, but ensure that we're ready for when things turn. And I'd just add, it was a couple of years ago that we put -- we announced the strategy and started executing on it. So we have the benefit of the historic investments that we're seeing the drivers playing out well. And as I say, well, we should be well positioned when the market turns here. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. I just want to follow up on the comments about  markets to be relatively flat in '23. Obviously, a very good 4Q. And I know I was concerned about some of the RWA management and FICC in recent quarters. And I think [indiscernible] to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue. But as you think about '23, like the wallets have been strong in recent years. And to your point, your FICC leadership was strong this year. how confident are you in kind of that flat market? And maybe what's driving that view? It's a market business, right? And so you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any markets business. With that said, we've got a very, very strong FICC franchise. We had a very good year, a very good year this year. I think we're well positioned with the client base, and we're well positioned to maintain our #1 position as we go into 2023.  Now how that market and market wallet moves, I think, is going to predicate on a number of things, including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like. But again, I feel like we're well positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out. So I think flat relative to a year that we've had as significantly as it is, is a reasonable call based on what we know now. We've also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well. So equity derivatives, for example, the real strength, this was an equity derivative year. So there's some -- and the corporate world with the volatility that's out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours. And for better or for worse, we're expecting that strength to continue, certainly [indiscernible] so far. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Mark, maybe just digging into NII a little bit. If you look at 4Q annualized, you have a decent step down -- but when you take a look at your deposit franchise, your mix of business, versus your peers, where they're seeing probably lagging retail deposits in the U.S., pricing that's going to hurt second half NII [indiscernible] high betas, mostly institutional. You mentioned the benefit from non-U.S. rates and you're growing deposits. So why sort of the -- a similar trend in NII versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on? Just trying to think that through because it doesn't look like the legacy you drag is very big in your chart? Similar dynamics you say in '23 or you're talking about the fourth quarter. I'm not sure I followed. No, I'm just trying to talk about versus peers, some have guided similarly to down from 4Q annualized run rates, but you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth benefits from non-U.S. rates and a much higher beta. Right. Yes. So I think -- I mean I think I'd point to a couple of things on the NII side, just as it relates to us. One, importantly, that I mentioned in and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we've got about 65% or so in ICG and the balance, 35% in our PBWM business.  We certainly skew to U.S. dollar, but we've got a 30% or so that is a non-U.S. dollar. And when I think about the potential or the forward curves and how rates will likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-U.S. side, right? And so if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the U.S. with our Corporate Clients segment. And so I think there's some repricing opportunities that we'll continue to actively manage as we did here in the U.S.  And so I do think it's that international footprint, the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in 2023. The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out is the continued growth from a volume point of view.  And that volume growth, you've seen the momentum already pick up on the card side with significant growth in interest-earning balances. And we'd expect that to continue, particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper. And so I think those things will be 2 major contributors. Mix is obviously a factor. As you point out, we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from legacy. But it's that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios that I think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about. No, that's all fair. But I guess maybe I didn't phrase my question right, but I felt it ex markets, I think your forecast for 2023 would be less than the 4Q run rate ex markets and yet you just... Sorry, finish your question. I'm sorry. Well, just you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving the decline from 4Q levels. I think the thing you've got to pick up is really the legacy franchise and the NII. A large part of the legacy franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there. And so I think that's the important element here that we haven't quantified to a dollar amount, but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, there's other factors, but that's important. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Mark, can you share with us on your comments regarding -- and this is true for your peers as well, the normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit losses. So when you look at branded cards or retail sales, retail services, how do you see that progressing through '23? One of your peers pointed out that they think that by the end of '23, they may be at that normalization rate that they look to for their numbers, but I'm just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are thinking. Yes. Let me jump in and then I'll hand it over to Mark. I think we are expecting under the current trajectory to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end, early '24 level. If you think of branded cards, if I was to quantify, it is 20% of the way there now. CRS, we're about 40% of the way there now. Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing of the loss sharing with our partners that helps us. But I hope that gives you a sense around it, probably the most important driver that we've been worried about, it was very uncertain with what was happening with payment rates. And I think we've got much more clarity as they started that normalization path -- so that's driving a fair amount of more certainty around what the direction is happening there. Frankly, the big question is more what's happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now. It's a bigger uncertainty. But Mark, any other observations? The only thing I'd add is that, Gerard, you could see just depending on how this plays out, you could see kind of NCL rates tick up above normal levels and then come back down to normal levels in the time line that Jane described, again, just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out. But again, we -- as we sit here and talk about these NPL rates, it's important to point out as well that we're very well reserved across all of these portfolios -- and so to some extent, if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NPLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established. But the trend line is exactly as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick-up above normal levels and then it come back down. Also this is such an unusual market in the sense that you've got such strong labor market, driven by, frankly, supply shortage over as much as demand. And we've also got the consumers with still very high savings that they're dipping into, and we're seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this -- but this is not going to be like a normal recession [indiscernible] will be about the manageability and the mildness of that likely if we do have one. And what kind of unemployment rates -- are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory? Is it -- we get the 5% unemployment by first quarter '24? I think a couple of things. So one, our base case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it, just as we forecasted it. The downside would be something a bit more severe than that. I'd say we're reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate just kind of overall when you look at -- when you average across the different scenarios that we have. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Just 2 quick questions. First one, just on cards, the card NIM has been kind of flattish. And I know that obviously it has to do with just how you internally allocate the funding towards it. But can you just kind of talk us through what's happening either with rewards or either incremental teaser rates on some of the new relationships? And should we see the card NIM expand from here? Yes. I'm not going to get into, Ken, kind of guidance on NIM. What I will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the card side. We've made very good traction. And Jane, you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners and with American. And we've also launched a number of new products that I think is helping to fuel the growth that we've seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we've seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we've seen. But I really don't want to get into the NIM guidance at the card level or the aggregate at this point. . Yes. I mean we have a fabulous cards franchise. And when we look at strong track record in the digital, the other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as with our partners. And we're really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at the moment. From custom cash, it was 28% of new account acquisition. So an important new product refresh that's driving things, 80% of customers engaging digitally.  Innovations like America is just a fantastic partner of ours, really taking that to the next level. And you can see that with the growth in spend in the category. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the return and the margins and the other trajectory here. And as I say, a prime portfolio, which is always a good thing. Great. And my second question was, there was an article about changing management up in the wealth management business this week. And I just wonder if you can talk about that, but also just about the progress that you're making inside the wealth management relative to your -- the KPIs and the goals that you've discussed at Analyst Day. Well, sure. I mean, 2 years ago, I asked Jim O'Donnell to put the wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm. And now as we move to the next phase, but as we've said, a strategically important business, I thought it was the right time to change the leadership also because Jim is going to play an important role moving forward, supporting [indiscernible] the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. He's got a lot of relationship with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds, and he's going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm's full capabilities to these clients. So I felt the time was right to make the move. And we will be, as indicated, strictly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business. And in the meantime, business as usual as we grow and follow the strategy that we have, and we're looking forward to the market turning, as I'm sure everyone is and feel that we're well positioned to do so. Your next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. This is actually [indiscernible] for Steven. Just on the topic of credit, one of your peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental $6 billion or so of reserves if they assume 6% unemployment under CECL. Can you -- just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve levels, and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the 4Q base based on your macro outlook and potential growth [indiscernible]? Yes, -- why don't I take that? I'm not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you here on the fly. What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against 3 scenarios, that base scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario and upside scenario, and we weight those scenarios. And the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession. And in that baseline, unemployment was, call it, 4.4% or so in terms of the unemployment assumption. We also had a downside scenario. Unemployment in the downside scenario got to a 6.9% or so. And then we had an upside scenario. The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5.1 that I mentioned. And those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the quarter. And largely, when you think about the weightings we put on those scenarios, the weighting skewed towards that base and that downside. The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around cards. And that really had to do the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI. But what I would say is that it also reflects, as I mentioned earlier, a cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are well below what they would be in a normal cycle. And it does pick up the fact that there's volume growth that we saw in the quarter there. So I'm not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully, that gives you some perspective as to what's underneath the models that we've used to establish these reserves. And obviously, we do that  on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I'd also just jump in, one of the areas that sometimes gets [indiscernible] about the firm, is on the corporate credit side. When we look at our corporate client portfolio, don't equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint. When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure with multinational firms and their subsidiaries, and these are all in the business investment grade. I think that's another area where as we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio, as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take. But I think important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk. That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, it seems like a part of your revenue targets for 2023 depends on some improvement in the environment. For example, stabilizing equity markets, IB rebound? And Jane, you also noted that the medium-term targets are designed to be achievable in different environments. So if the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in 2022, can you just talk about some of the levers you might be able to pull that might provide an offset? Well, it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right? Because you could have -- I don't anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in investment banking, but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the markets business. So there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario. I think what's really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them.  And so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that we were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year [indiscernible] that's what gives us the confidence to around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we've talked about and really push execution, and that's exactly what we're doing. And an important part of '23, it's not just the impact of the cycle, but also you'll see the impact of the different investments that we've been making. And you've certainly seen that, for example, in services this year, and we've been very transparent around the 70 basis point increase. We've seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up to the third quarter. So you've not only got drivers here in terms of what's happening in the market, but you've also got the strategic drivers, also kicking in more and more together, as Mark referred to the synergies. A great point, Jane, because it may not always show up in the top line, which is why we put those KPIs out there. There are often indicators of some of the upside that's on the come as the market evolves. Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Yes. So one question, one follow-up. So you have a -- your slide says you have a CET1 target of 13% by midyear, but you're already there. And I guess, if we go back to the Banamex thing, I guess, is that kind of assuming potential capital impact from divestitures or why would you have a target 6 months out when you've already met it? Yes, Mike, I have to tell you that I'm surprised that you're asking about Mexico, just given our history together, but I understand it. And what I would say is that a couple of things. One, we clearly see where we trade, right? And we're not happy about where we trade. And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today. So if we could buy back, right, we could do buybacks as soon as we're able to do buybacks, we will, right? I mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders.  The second thing I'd say is we did get to the 13% sooner. And that was, again, in accordance with executing against our strategy. And our parts of our business, particularly the markets business, has done a really good job at delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA, and we've been able to get there without damaging the franchise, which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in fixed income.  What's ahead of us, as you rightfully pointed out, is that we've got a number of exits that have to take place, there's puts and takes across many of them. But Mexico, in particular, will have a temporary impact on our CET1 ratio. And so we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next 2 quarters so that we can absorb that. And we also want to make sure that we're positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always, but certainly over the next couple of quarters, while we manage the headwind, temporary headwind from that exit.  So hopefully, that gives you a better sense for it, but we're actively managing this, and we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. Yes. I want to reiterate that as well. I mean it's very important to us. And as Mark said, we know where we trade. We've made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders' interest in compensation and management interest, all these various dimensions. And we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we're going to do and continue delivering against what we say we're going to be delivering. And with the CPA impact essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we're taking that into account. All right. That's very clear. And then lastly, your NII guide, excluding markets related is higher for 2023, but I think that implies a little step down from the fourth quarter level, not as much as JPMorgan was guiding down 10% from the fourth quarter level. I was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from being outside the U.S. What are some of the ins and outs there? Yes. You've got a couple of points here. So one is we won't see NII momentum as we've seen in 2022, just as betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels, that's obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into '23. But some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year, and so that will be a plus in 2023. And you'll also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the U.S. and given our mix, that will benefit us in 2023. And then there'll be a volume that will contribute to that NII growth, particularly as we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the card side. The offset will be the legacy franchise, right? And so as those exits occur as the wind downs continue, as I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII. And so we'll have to grow over that and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that we've set. So those are the puts and takes. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Have a great day. Thank you. This does conclude the Citi Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review Call. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning. On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer.  This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.  Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update.   Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.   I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to some -- led to very little strategic activity and capital raising.   Despite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered on an ROTCE of 16%, including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our more stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8% ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015. When markets rebound, we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm, and from an even stronger position.   Before turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals in our annual strategic update appropriately titled Delivering Growth Through the Next Decade.  Briefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he's retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best.   Please now turn to the deck and to Slide 3. What informs our confidence and growth strategy is that we know who we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date, and the next decade will be no different.   On Slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We're committed to our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat, which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength.   Slide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decades that are focused on aligning markets -- ourselves to the markets where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets; that are on the whole, more balance sheet-light; and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues. We continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management.  Importantly, we've also taken action to get out of businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit, payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we know best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets.   Please turn to Slide 6. This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pretax profit. The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise.   Fair to say, our business model was tested this year, as you can see on Slide 7. 2022 was a paradigm shift. Firstly, the common -- continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe in over 70 years and the highest inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well. We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE; had the most excess risk-based capital of our peers; and attracted over $300 billion of net new assets; all while integrating 2 major acquisitions.  So now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade, let's start with Wealth Management. On Slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provides the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels.   The growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues, something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80 million, and over 1/3 of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only 3 years ago, where 95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million, and none exceeded $100 million.   The history of the journey as illustrated on Slide 7. Wealth Management has gone through a powerful transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions in -- of E*TRADE and Solium, which have expanded our client base with 2 new channels. Today, we have 18 million relationships. We focus on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach -- and the reach that will propel future growth.   Net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to date, and you can see the driving forces highlighted on Slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings, allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending balances over the last 3 years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive high-quality loans.   On the other side, our deposits franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII through various cycles. Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base. And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate-hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes.   Let's turn to Slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth: Net new assets. Over the last 3 years, our platform generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets, showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be ups and downs in individual years. But over a 3-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new assets.   Most importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a combination of several things which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money.   You can see on Slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets, we have experienced that through our workplace channel. We estimate now that relationships, wealth held away, has expanded by about 4x in the last 3 years. With our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets.  Further, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention.   The results of our advice-driven strategy are illustrated on Slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering, that of our stock plan administrative services.  Over the last 3 years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows. Vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of advice. To date, we've already seen adviser-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a workplace relationship. A portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away. In short, we will -- as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working.   Investment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as you can see on Slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014. And importantly, this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from fixed income, customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets.  We remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our alternative investment capital is at $210 billion, with strong growth in private credit; real assets, including infrastructure; our multi-strategy hedge fund platform; and special situations. And customization by our market-leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine.   Shifting to Institutional Securities on Slide 15. We have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active. This has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities.   On Slide 16, you can see our institutional business remains a top 3 global leader in the industry, as demonstrated by a wallet share positions. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudence over resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from '22 to -- '21 to '22 and our consistent GSIB surcharge of 3%.   Let's move to our capital strategy on Slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement. This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses, and we've seen a steady decline in our SCB, excluding the dividend add-on, relative -- reflective of our more durable business mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned.   On Slide 18, you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enable us to double that dividend -- enabled us to double our dividend in 2021 and further increase it by 11% in 2022. Over the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions. Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements' demand.   Shifting to how we see the future state on Slide 19, starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management. We've demonstrated our ability to generate, over the last 3 years, positive net new assets of approximately $300 billion a year. Combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead.   Now let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute. In 2022, the firm delivered $14 billion of pretax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating approximately 50 basis points of revenue, which is about what we're doing currently, at a 30% pretax margin, which is within 2% of what we're doing currently. If you put that math together, it should create, of itself, over $14 billion of pretax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses.   So if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, Slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They have not changed on account of what's gone on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we need to support our longer-term objectives.   Of note, we've added a new goal that I spoke to earlier, that we've talked about in the last 6 months, to generate $1 trillion in net new assets approximately every 3 years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter by quarter, year by year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over 3 years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about, by the way, 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within wealth and asset management.   As we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share-leading positions across much of Institutional Securities. As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment. However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to achieve our goals over time.   I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results. And we'd be delighted to take your questions. Thank you, and good morning. In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion and PBT was $14.1 billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion.  The strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off. Wealth Management had a record year and fixed income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed very well in a challenging environment, as it was designed to do.  The full year results included $470 million of integration-related expenses, of which, $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter. Excluding these impacts, EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter, respectively. The full year ROTCE was 15.3% and 15.7%, excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter, severance expenses of $133 million related to a December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit -- or net discrete tax benefits of $89 million largely offset each other through net income. The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 72.4%.   Total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses, principally related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues, were offset by higher noncompensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend. As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-keeping requirement in the second quarter.  As the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, and this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results. However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E*TRADE, the final back-office integration remains scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related expenses this year. These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately 2/3 related to E*TRADE and 1/3 related to Eaton Vance.   Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first 9 months of the year, reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment.  Weaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment Banking revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transactions. Underwriting was more challenged, in line with the broader market.   Full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher-quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&A and underwriting market volumes weighed on results.  As we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialogue and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity.   Equity full year trading -- excuse me, equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year, primarily driven by lower market activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across regions.  Derivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter.  Fixed income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities.  Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated and clients repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in micro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses. Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million.   Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion and a record pretax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%.  Full year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our deferred cash-based compensation plans, referred to as DCP. This negatively impacted our full year revenues by $858 million, with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses. As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period. The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement.   Fourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion, and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%.  Total client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311 billion in the year represents a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $52 billion with contributions across channels.  Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products.  Bank lending balances grew by 17% in the year, or 13% -- or $17 billion in the year or 13%, and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by paydowns in securities-based lending due to the higher interest rate environment.  Total deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisers with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environments. Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients' needs.  Net interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII has peaked. We enter the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last 2 quarters, we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve is realized.  Investment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds. Also -- and also impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions, particularly parametric customized portfolios, as well as our special situation strategies and private credit.  Fourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million. We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gain from having fixed income, parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand.  Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by $9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs, partially offset by capital actions, contributed to our strong CET1 ratio.  We continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in the quarter.  The full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarterly volatility.  The firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain confident in the durability of the firm and the growth opportunities in the year ahead. Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us ballast. Importantly, our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover. Finally, while still very early in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement seen so far.  With that, we will now open the line to questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. I appreciate all the slides, too. Okay. Two big picture questions, I guess. One, James, with the 200 basis points of excess over your CET1 requirements, the big buffer served you well, you've got a lot of buybacks. But also, it's dilutive to returns. And I'm just curious how you balance that, of keeping that buffer? Or is that buffer more temporary weighting on Basel III end game, final results? Or is that something you want -- you plan on sitting in? I'm just curious on your big picture resting spot for that excess capital. Sure. Glenn, it's a great question, and it's sort of pivotal to the whole strategic positioning of the firm because right now, I think capital strategy is critical. There are a few things going on.  Firstly, we have been able to reduce our peak-to-trough in CCAR because of the change in mix in our business. Secondly, because of the market environment, we've reduced RWAs. Just we've taken maybe a more prudent lean in. And obviously, we can reverse that at any point in time, which eats up CET1.  Thirdly, we have the Basel III, finally looks like it's coming to fruition at some point in the first half of the year. Although I don't expect that banks will be required to implement whatever the new capital rules are until the beginning of 2025. So while there's a pretty long time frame, a year is a long time in this business, let alone 1.5 years, I'd still think that it's prudent to kind of have some capital sitting there and just -- I'd rather be in a position where we have excess capital when, particularly in an environment where we don't see obvious places we'd put it to work.  Now that said, we did our best. We bought back, I think it was $8 billion and -- $10 billion last year. We doubled the dividend the year before. We increased the dividend 11% last year. Obviously, we're -- I mean, it's fair to assume that we're going to continue moving on capital distributions.  But I like a number of 15%. We actually -- we triggered a little higher than that this quarter. We could easily drop down to 14.5%, that wouldn't bother me at all. But that will be driven by the environment and business opportunities.  So great position to be in coming into a change in the regulatory outlook potentially. And we can always act aggressively, and we've proven we will do that when we have more clarity. I appreciate that. One other big picture is -- so Wealth Management's growing great, everybody's happy. I think historically and even now, you've been considered a very equity-centric from, whether it be wealth and asset management or your dominant equities platform. So curious if you're thinking about, it's possible with these higher rates, lots of clients shift to a more defensive stance. There's good income out there to be earned without much risk, or too much risk. If we see a more material shift towards fixed income appetite in general, do you think that in any way disadvantages Morgan Stanley as a firm in overall profitability? I mean, listen, our share of fixed income is 10%; banking, 15%; equities, 20%. So obviously, the fixed income pool grows. By the way, our share a few years ago, it was 6%. So the team under Ted and Sam Kellie-Smith has done a phenomenal job. But if the pool grows faster in fixed income, just arithmetically, you're not going to do as well as if the pool grew faster in equities. That doesn't bother me a whole lot.  I mean, we've never tried to be the FX, EM shop. We've never had the global rates trading, FX trading, macro businesses that some of the correspondent-driven commercial banks have had, the HSBCs and Citis. And that's a business model, just different. We don't have as big transaction services, so we're not going to have as much FX. That said, what the team have done in macro, under Jakob under credit and Jay Hallik in commodities, is really impressive.  So I'm totally fine with that. And we clearly have the product. It's not like we don't sell muni bonds to our clients and we don't have fixed income underwriting, et cetera. We have the product. It's just arithmetically, given our share relative to the others, we wouldn't grow as fast.  By the way, I was happy to see, I think, equities was back at #1 this quarter, core franchise. And we're really well positioned, Glenn. I'm not bothered by that at all. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. I guess maybe first question, just Sharon, following up on the efficiency ratio, about 72% for 2022. As we think about the journey from 72% to something sub-70% kind of in line with your strategic target, give us a sense of what it means. Is it this time? And are the businesses growing, which are more efficient, and that changes the mix? Or could we see that sub-70% even over the next couple of years? Would love to hear it in terms of both from a timing standpoint and what needs to happen at the firm to get to a sustainably below 70% efficiency ratio. Sure. So if you think about, we were -- we've been below 70%, right? So if you look back to the last couple of years, and there are periods of time where we are below, there's obviously 2 pieces to it, both the expense side and the revenue side. I think that as we continue to gain scale across the businesses, each of those dollars that we put to work will be more and more efficient.  As I highlighted, where we've been investing a lot of those dollars is on the technology side. I noted that in my prepared remarks, and we have seen that both from the cyber resiliency side and also just as we think about the broader integrations of all of the platforms that we've acquired over the last couple of years.  So as I think through it and I think about the timing, obviously, a different revenue environment will certainly help. And there's tremendous operating leverage, particularly as you think about the Institutional Securities business, which will help to drive that.  Now if you go through each of the businesses, each of those businesses also exhibit operating leverage, right? If you have a constructive market environment, we've seen very strong margins also from the Investment Management business. We're on our way to achieve the 30% margin target as you relate to the Wealth Management business.  So I'd say it's a balance of both, both the revenue environment and how that turns around, and then just continued discipline and making sure that we have the right investments as we think about our expense base going forward. So we've been extremely prudent and disciplined as we think about the base over the last especially 9 months that we've seen with this type of environment. Got it. And I guess just a separate question around markets activity. Obviously, highly uncertain how Investment Banking activity shakes out. But if the Fed were to pause and the central banks are done with the majority of the rate hikes, is that enough to drive a rebound in M&A, ECM, DCM? Or do we need a lot more in terms of just confidence returning to the market before we see IB activity picking up? Like what are you hearing for the clients? I think -- sure. Why don't I start, and if James has anything to add? I basically say that from -- if we think about the Investment Banking pipeline, the pipeline itself isn't what's changed. What's changed is that movement from the pipeline to realized.  And when we think about what will cause that, that policy pivot, a peak in inflation, something that allows the CEOs that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence, both with their own economic outlook and -- or excuse me, our own company outlook, the economic outlook that hinges on it. And then also just price clarity and valuation certainty. Those are the things that, as you think through it, we would expect to see move from the pipeline stage into the realized and announced stage. So the macro environment that you laid out, where there is more clarity on the economy, and then also a reduction in volatility, should help that move forward. Yes, I would say I think Sharon said it right. And I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up. I would bet the year on that, in fact.  CEO's job is to drive growth in their businesses, and they do that 2 ways, organic and inorganic. And I've been doing this a long time, and I've done both. And the only tricky part about inorganic, once you've got your strategy set, is timing. And sometimes, you've got to ignore timing. But if the market is really volatile, it behooves CEOs, particularly those relatively early in their careers, to be a little cautious, and that's what we're seeing. That will change. We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. And just would like to wish Jon Pruzan best of luck. Looking forward to watching his next chapter play out.  So Sharon, would love to double click on your expectations for NII. Hear you that it's sort of based on the forward curve playing out, and encouraging certainly to hear it's not peaked. But could you maybe give a little bit more color around expectations beyond forward curve? What do you assume for deposit dynamics? Do you think that the decline in sweep balances will continue to decline? What's underlying that? Sure. So let's take a step back and just say, why did we outperform in the fourth quarter, Brennan? And if you think about that, we obviously -- when we look at the liability side, we outperformed there, and we performed on the assets side. So if we unpack a little bit of the liability side, I take it into 2 pieces.  As you highlighted, it's obviously about the deposit mix and also about pricing. So what we've seen in the deposit mix is that we have seen a moderation in the pace of outflows of those BDPs. Obviously, what -- where we will go from here, we'll need that to play out. But that is something that we take out into account when we think about the first quarter guidance.  The second point is, obviously, on the actual liability pricing, we did see an outperformance of that pricing. And when we exit the first quarter, we take that in -- exit, excuse me, the fourth quarter and take that into the first quarter, that's a benefit as well. So the Fed hiking 125 basis points over the fourth quarter and then being able to have disciplined pricing over the fourth quarter will serve us well in the first. Okay. And then certainly different question. Wealth Management, if we look at the client asset trends, they were barely up quarter-over-quarter. Basically, total client assets in wealth were up about the equivalent of the net new assets. And can clearly see that self-directed and workplace were a little weak, probably because their exposure -- more exposure to the Qs and the more growthy stocks. Was -- but I would think, given what we saw in the markets, that there would be a bit more of a tailwind to client assets. Was there anything unusual that was happening there? No. Actually -- and what you highlighted is broadly correct in terms of where you see the broader exposure, the underlying exposure of those different channels. So it's just a function of the assets that you actually see as well as the mix of the underlying assets based on the channel. We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. So wanted to dig in a little bit further, Sharon, as it relates to Brennan's question on NII. The 2 pieces I want to understand a little bit better is, one, what are you assuming for SBL growth in the coming year? Or even loan growth broadly across the wealth complex?  And secondly, you saw really nice deposit growth in the fourth quarter. I wanted to understand, how much of that is a function of tax loss harvesting that you expect to be redeployed? Or do you think any of that deposit growth is actually going to prove to be a bit stickier? Sure. I'm just going to take them -- I'll take them in order. The first is, as you asked about loan growth. The NII guidance in the first quarter is not dependent on the loan growth projections. Obviously, the loan growth itself will be a function of the environment. As I said, from an SBL perspective, we have seen some paydowns, and it will be dependent on market conditions.  Now the second quarter -- the second question that you asked me around the deposits and the deposit growth. Obviously, there are -- there could be a portion of it that does come from, as you mentioned, different inputs that you might see, be that interest, et cetera, in the end of the fourth quarter. But broadly speaking, what we've seen with the deposit base is that we have many channels, i.e., savings, for example, where we can begin to get those deposits and attract new deposits to the institution and to the bank from other sources, external assets held away that come in.  And also, as you think about every piece of NNA that comes in over time, the $1 trillion that James mentioned, there's generally a portion of that, that's actually held from a cash perspective. And so that, I think, also needs to be taken account when thinking about the build as you go forward from the deposit -- a longer-term deposit perspective. That's great. And just for my follow-up. As it relates to the trading outlook, I thought you guys did a really nice job of articulating some of the potential sources or drivers of inflection in Investment Banking activity. Admittedly, we've experienced a couple of years of pretty gangbusters trading and markets activity. I was hoping to get your perspective on how you're thinking about the outlook for the trading businesses. If you're willing to go so far as to suggest what normalization might look like across both FICC and equities would be really helpful. Sure. I would look at it more holistically from an institutional perspective. And so when I think about what does it mean? We entered -- I remember doing an investor conference in February of last year. And we talked a lot about what is normal? And is 2019 normal? And our answer then was we would expect to actually normalize somewhere between 2019 and 2020 from an industry wallet perspective. In fact, it looks as though the industry wallet has just been right around that range, within those 2 bounds. And when we look ahead, we would expect to remain above that 2019 level, and we'll have to see what the upside is.  But a lot of that growth in Sales & Trading has come from the divergent central bank policies and has also come from the fact that you have higher yields, right? So when you think about investing into fixed income product and you go into that going forward, that could create different dynamics than we would have seen over the earlier 2010 through 2019 or '17 outlook for Sales & Trading. We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Wanted to follow up on the wealth business and the rollout of the companion accounts and the 90% that you've headed. Can you talk about the behavior change or what has happened subsequent to clients receiving those companion accounts? And try to get a sense of what that could mean on a longer-term basis in terms of increased activity and asset flows? Absolutely. As James highlighted in his prepared remarks, the intention is to generally be in a position where we're able to offer the right type of advice and content and wealth advice over the course in time when we go into the workplace. And so when we think about the retention of assets or we think about the companion account rollout, eventually, what that's really doing is to make sure that we've provided content. We look at content, as I've said before, as a passport into the employees. And you think about that as financial wellness.  Something that Jed highlighted in his presentation in the spring is, generally speaking, when you see $1 of vested assets that come into the institution through the stock plan business, we actually see approximately $9 compared to that $1 that come from assets held away. That's the consolidation of assets once you have this advice-based channel and the advice-based relationship.  And so what we're trying to do is build on that. We have an FA referral process. We continue to use technology to help match the right individuals with the right FAs. We have better relationship management within E*TRADE and making sure that larger accounts are also connected appropriately to the right teams. These are all ways to build the right advice for the right clients, to provide them choice and give them a reason to bring assets held away into the institution. Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you talked about the longer-term efficiency potential. But I guess the thing about fourth quarter, there was some severance. Looking at noncomp expense, as you think about next year, I just want to understand how we should think about the base level of expenses and potential changes and/or where you're looking to be more efficient into this year. I mean, we're always, as I said in my prepared remarks, looking at efficiency opportunities, where there might exist. We just, as you highlight, through the severance, we just had a December employee action. So we obviously walk in with a different level of comfort as we kind of think about the expense base going forward. But as we've done with our own resources from a capital perspective, we'll remain nimble and prudent, and look forward if and as the economic environment changes. I think just on the efficiency ratio, it's worth pointing out, and Sharon mentioned this earlier. If you actually average the last 2 years, '21, '22, you end up right at 70%. '21 was about 67%, '22 at 73%. Part of it is revenue-driven. We took the efficiency that will take some expenses out in the coming year. We also want to feed the beast. I mean, we're growing parts of this firm.  We're trying to -- we don't -- we're not of the view that we're heading into a dark period. Whatever negativity in the world is out there, that's not our house view. So we want to make sure we're positioned for growth. This thing will turn, M&A underwriting will come back, I'm positive of it. So we want to be well positioned for it. But we're going to manage to that number of around 70% as best as we can. We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. I have a bigger picture. James, you gave us some very good detail about the expectations for growth in the Wealth Management and the new assets, $1 trillion every 3 years. When you're looking at your 3 channels, the adviser-led, workplace and self-directed, where do you see the most growth? And which one has the best margin that can get you to that 30% goal? Well, the adviser is the biggest, obviously, by far. We have 15,000, 16,000 advisers, a phenomenal business. The direct channel is, from the acquisition of E*TRADE combined with our Morgan Stanley Direct, great business. Obviously, it's a little more market-sensitive, a little more active, particularly on the option side, during bullish market environments.  And the workplace is sort of the sleeper. I've said previously, I think, 2 years ago, I thought in a decade, we'd look back at this firm and say that the workplace was the most significant strategic change to happen over the last decade. I truly believe that the workplace employee, the retirement space, is sort of the next frontier, and we're right in the middle of that.  So as to margins, they're probably margin accretive in reverse order. In other words, workplace first, the direct second and the adviser third. That's simply a function of advisers. We have adviser payout. And God bless them for the jobs that they do, and we're very happy to pay them.  So I think it's a combination, Gerard, of all 3 of them. We will hit the 30% margin. I mean, we're almost there now in a more challenging environment. So that, I have 0 anxiety about. Whether it's this year or next year, it's coming, and all of them will contribute. Very good. I appreciate that. And Sharon, you talked about the marks that you took in the corporate loan portfolio in the quarter, just over $350 million, I think you said. Can you share with us, how big is that portfolio? And where did the marks come from? Were they bridge loans? Or what drove those marks? So you have different disclosures as it relates to various loans and lending commitments that we gave. As we think about that line, it's inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio. And it was also worth highlighting there that we also mentioned the net -- the interest that you receive on the loans that we hold as well as the fees associated with those loans. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. James, last quarter, I asked you when will you be ready for Plan B if the pipeline doesn't seem like it's going to be converted? And you said you're at Plan A-. So just kind of looking for an update there.  And in terms of the headwinds, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like the pipeline is still good but down quarter-over-quarter because some of those deals have converted. And also, you said it's still not back yet. And as it relates to the Twitter financing, you were the lead bank. Can you disclose any write-down that you had on Twitter or simply the leveraged loan category? So that's the headwind.  On the other hand, I guess, there's been some reports that you've reduced headcount. So if you could just give us more color on that, especially Twitter. Okay. Let me try and unpack that a little bit. I'm not going to talk about Twitter. We don't talk about single names, as you would expect. You did see the line -- the other ISG line. You can assume that whatever marks we took on any single name are reflected in that.  And I think the way I think about this is we run a portfolio business. We obviously have single credits at any point in time that disappoint relative to others. But it's the total package. And the total package, if you look at it, actually turned out to be very fine given the environment we're in.  So on the Plan B, I don't know if the rip we did -- we took about 1,800 heads in early December, would equate to a Plan B. It certainly felt like it. We've reduced -- we took a severance charge, Mike, which affected some of the efficiency ratio for this year, but will improve it for next year. And that was the rightsizing.  We were frankly a little overdue. We hadn't done anything for a couple of years. We've had a lot of growth, and we'll continue monitoring that. Obviously, with the way bonus pools work, we've reflected the performance of the firm in the bonus pool. So we're not very different from the rest of the world in that regard. And that obviously resets comp a little bit.  So I feel good about where the whole package is. I'm actually, as I said earlier, alluded to, I'm a little more confident about the long -- medium-term outlook for the market. I'm not talking about the first quarter or 2, although Sharon said the first quarter has actually started well. But the medium-term outlook for the markets, I see the Fed has moved from 75 to 50, likely to go to 25. The next stop on the trend line is 0, and then to mention when they will start cutting. Not sure they're going to cut this year, but I think they will be 0 increases this year for sure. So that's the inflection point.  And there's a lot of money sitting around waiting to be put to work. And that's our job, is to be the flow of capital between those who have it and those who need it. So I'm pretty confident actually about the outlook. So we're -- we've done our Plan B, I guess. We're not anticipating a Plan C. And we're going to watch and wait for a little while, but I feel pretty good about it. We'll take our last question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the flows within Investment Management, both the long-term and liquidity. And how you're thinking about the outlook there, specifically in the long term? Sure. Absolutely. The long term, obviously, what we saw over the course of this year was some movements in equities. That was the most notable. That obviously had to do with some of the higher-growth specific -- the specific funds that we have there. But I think you have to really think about those long terms from a long-term basis, right? So you're just focusing on this year, but there were many, many years of very strong flows into that business.  What's important is actually the diversification that we had because of Eaton Vance, where we have other products that we're able to offset some of the long -- some of the outflows in, say, the equity products, for example. So parametric is one where we continue to see inflows throughout even the course of this year. We're really focused on the secular growth trends, sustainability, alternatives and customization more broadly. Those are the things that we think, as we move forward, we'll be positive for those line items. There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 17, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information and forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David. Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of our financial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After 9 straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter. FICC and Equities activities -- activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients, and our equity investment portfolio saw continued headwinds. We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the year, quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter. We always strive to maintain a pay-for-performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower. That said, we also recognize that we operate in a talent-driven business, and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our world-class franchise. On our earnings call last July, we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our noncompensation costs. We have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources, especially in light of the worse-than-expected backdrop in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced the size of our balance sheet, further optimized and reduced our RWA footprint and manage down our G-SIB score to hit our 3% target. We have also started firm-wide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and rightsize the firm for the current environment. We made the difficult decision to conduct a 6% headcount reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we had paused our regular performance management-related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in headcount given the opportunity set in 2021. We feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions. They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals, and we wish them the best. Additionally, we are taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create shareholder value. For instance, this quarter, we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey. We also narrowed our ambitions on our Consumer strategy and made some key decisions. We started a process to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform, We will likely allow the book to roll down naturally, although we are considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product. At the right time in the future, we intend to offer checking to our Wealth Management clients. For now, our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky. Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses. We are very focused on developing a path toward profitability and platform solutions, and we'll provide more detail at our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us -- for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inflation, but some we never thought we'd see, like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren't many signs of widespread distress. Balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy, but it's clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., Central Bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy. And the labor market remains remarkably tight, with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near term. They're rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer-term plans. Many firms have started preparing for tougher times, focusing on factors within their control. Taking a step back, I am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. We generated double-digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove significant market disruption, with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. We reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. We also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our first Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor. That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us, and we believe we have a lot to play for. As we go forward, we are executing on 3 key priorities we've laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees in our Asset & Wealth Management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in our Global Banking & Markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver profitability. We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments, and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have the people in place around the world to serve our clients' broad range of needs with excellence, and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. We look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I'll now turn it over to Denis. Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $11.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today. Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year, down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year. The exceptional performance of our Global Banking & Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated, has served a strong ballast for firm-wide performance. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year, driven by a significant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty. Advisory revenues, however, were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history, rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our #1 league table position in completed M&A as we have for 23 of the last 24 years, and we rank second in equity and equity-related underwriting. We also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from #3 last year. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity but remain solid, particularly in advisory. That being said, clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity. While we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly, we are seeing some positive signs of activity, particularly in investment-grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 44% year-on-year. In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased Central Bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC financing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-on-year. The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year. Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter. Across FICC and Equities, financing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client financing activities. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion, putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million. Moving on to Page 6. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products. Let's now turn to Page 7, where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year. Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I'll turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions. We expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level, and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our #1 priority for this segment is to reach profitability, and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-offs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. We anticipate further pressure in 2023, given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially offset by higher noncompensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. We expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our 60% efficiency ratio target as the right place to run the firm. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents a 130 basis point buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter, we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run significantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the firm. We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders, and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. So given the capital RWA and expense actions that you've already taken, if 2023 is a little bit better in banking but it's kind of the same atmosphere we've been in, because it feels like it's lingering, can you all get closer to your return targets this year? I know it's very difficult in this backdrop but what I'm getting at is do we need Investment Banking to be a lot better to get there? Or have the actions you've taken start closing the gap? So thanks, Glenn, and I appreciate the question. Obviously, an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. We talk about our targets in a normalized environment. One thing I just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in Asset Management. This certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet in Asset Management. And we've made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very significant Asset Management balance sheet, larger than we'd like to have. We reduced it by $9 billion this past year, and we intend to move forward. But given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it's not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. And if you look at the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter, it earned 0, even with some businesses in there that are highly profitable. I don't think that's normal. I don't think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way. And so I think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the Asset Management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. I'd highlight last year, we way outperformed the peer average ROE by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus, and a bunch of that reversed, and we're just more sensitive to that. I mean things I might add, Glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the forward, I think the reason why we're taking action with respect to our headcount footprint and some of our noncompensation expenses is to drive efficiency even further. And as you point out, with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year, we're in a pretty flexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders. Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe staying up to 50,000. Transaction Banking is good, but it's unfortunately a small revenue base. Consumer, maybe music to some investors' ears, is being deemphasized. So I guess my question is where's -- your goal is to build a more durable firm, and I share that goal. Where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being deemphasized from the past strategy? Well, I think, Glenn, the big thing in that, and it's always been a big part of it, is the shift from a balance sheet-intensive Asset Management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. Our organic growth across our Asset Management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry. We continue to grow our management fees in the Asset Management business. We're continuing to grow our wealth business. Our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. And so it's that mix change, less balance sheet intensity, growth in Asset & Wealth Management, continued financing growth in our core Global Banking & Markets business, which you've seen and continue to grow, and then getting these platforms that we have to operate profitably, which we believe we can do. We believe they're good businesses at scale, but they're in a different stage of their development. Those things should make the business more resilient, and that's not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out 3 years ago, and we will amplify again next month at Investor Day. What I think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets-heavy and balance sheet-intense business had, of course, with a drag from some of the investments we're making in other things. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. I guess maybe, David, just sticking to that, as you make the Asset Management business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption, how do we think about the ROTE target you put out last year? Is that still achievable within the 3-year time frame that you had laid out? Or does that get pushed out given the work that needs to be done and in a world where Consumer's being deemphasized? I think, candidly, that it depends on the environment. An environment with massive swing in asset prices continues, we'll push it out. If that simply normalizes, then the overall economic picture of the firm, in addition to the work we're doing on the expense side that we've gotten focused on, will show a very, very different picture. I'm not going to guess on how that will play out. But again, I'd amplify that I don't think what we saw in 2022 was normal. And certainly, if you go back and look at 15 years of history, it wasn't. Okay. And I guess just as a follow-up in terms of growth in Asset Management, Wealth Management, significant asset price dislocations. Does that create some M&A opportunities when we think about inorganic growth in those businesses? Or for the time being is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic? I think at the moment, we're extremely focused on, in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform. And moving forward from here, I do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in Asset & Wealth Management. But certainly, this year, we're focused on the execution. We made an acquisition in Asset Management last year. We want to integrate NNIP. We want to move forward with that. So I think this year, we'll be focused on execution. We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. So David and Denis, I wanted to start off with a question just on the provision outlook. Admittedly, the loan loss provision came in higher than we had anticipated. And I was hoping you could just speak to how much of it was growth math-related versus deterioration in the macro? And given some of the planned actions you're going to take for that business, how should we think about like a normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we should expect going forward? So let me help with some color as it relates to provisions, particularly in the fourth quarter. So order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was about 50%, net charge-offs about 25%, and the balance attributable to our scenario. I think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter, and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of 2023, is that we began the on-balance sheet originations in our point-of-sale lending platform, GreenSky. And so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. So that's something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year. Got it. And maybe just for a follow-up on capital. As it relates to the discussion tied to Glenn's question, I was hoping you could speak to how your scenario planning for Basel IV, Basel III end game. I recognize we don't have a proposal yet, but certainly, it has significant implications for future returns you can generate. You're running with a healthy level of cushion at the moment, but just wanted to understand how you see it impacting your various businesses. What planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain? Sure. Fair question. It's on everybody's mind. As you note, we don't yet have the details, but we give it a lot of thought. We've taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that we'll be in a position to respond quickly to that. We do have a long-standing track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. You can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our financial resources that we were able to maneuver them very, very quickly to build capital and change our RWA footprint, given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. So we're standing by for more detail on the rule, but confident that when we get it, we'll be able to manage accordingly. We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Two questions. One follow-up on the Consumer business. I heard you on the Marcus pullback. You're going to see [ some ] originating there. Does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration in the partner card, GreenSky, those pieces that you're keeping? Or is this Marcus pullback going to feed either capital increase or the ability to lean in, in other business lines like the ISG business? Sure. Betsy, it's Denis. I'll start with that. So as we indicated, we're going to cease the originations in under Marcus lending, and then furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll off or we may pursue other alternatives. That should free up a bunch of financial resources. We're continued within the overall Asset & Wealth Management segment where the deposit business is resonant within the private banking and lending line. That remains a strategic priority for the firm, and we've experienced very good growth there. That business is achieving more and more scale, so that will remain an ongoing focus. I think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to Marcus lending, we'll continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. And within the Platform Solutions business, we're now down to 3 different businesses: Transaction Banking, the cards platform and our point-of-sale lending business, GreenSky. And our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to profitability. Okay. Then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter. I know you had the action of the headcount reduction. Is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out because, obviously, it's not ongoing? Or does that hit 1Q? Maybe you could speak to how we should think about that. Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. I have one. Dave, I think it's your birthday today, right? You announced that a few years ago. It is my birthday, and I couldn't be happier to be on this call with you. But thank you. Thank you for that. Well, since it's your birthday, do you want the positive question or the negative question first? I want -- I'm happy to take any question. Any question that you have, Mike. You know that. We're happy to take questions, both positive and tough. I mean it wasn't a great quarter, so I don't expect all the questions to be easy. Well, I mean, it is concerning in terms of the reorg, I mean we'll get more at the Investor Day. And just a comment, I hope you give us more data. Here we have 3 new sectors, and you only gave us the prior 4 quarters and the prior 2 years without much detail. So I hope you give us more ahead. But the question is, you present the firm differently, but will the firm actually be run differently other than the more narrow focus on Consumer? Yes. And so I appreciate that. And 2 comments. First, just on the transparency and information comment, I think this management team, Mike, over the last 4.5 years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of Goldman Sachs, and we remain focused on that. If you have certain feedback on things you'd like to see, et cetera, we really welcome that, and Carey will reach out to you, and we'll take that feedback. But we're focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we're doing. Second, on the evolution and the move to this, what I'd say, and this has been something that's been a journey that we started a number of years ago, but the firm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally. And that, candidly, is a difference than the way Goldman Sachs has been during my tenure at the firm. In terms of our core business of banking and markets, there are synergies that we've been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. I highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our Investor Day. It's long forgotten, but when we did our Investor Day, back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the ROE of the markets business above 10%. That was a big question on the minds of investors. And we look now at our combined banking and markets business. This business, we think, is a leader. It outperforms in terms of its market share and outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser-focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business. We also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our financing business there, and we're very, very focused on that. In Asset & Wealth Management, we've worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business. And as we've said over the last few years, reduce the balance sheet intensity of that. And we're on a journey. Would I like it to be further along? Yes. If it was further along, there would have been less volatility, particularly in the context of this year in the fourth quarter. But we continue -- that's something we laid out 3 years ago, and we continue to move at that. The change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in Consumer business, I think, is a change. We continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes. We think our partnership with Apple will provide meaningful dividends for the firm over time. We think GreenSky is a good business that can be accretive, but the platforms are in a different stage of development than our other businesses. They're small in the overall scale of Goldman Sachs, but we think there are benefits to that for the firm. We'll communicate more as we move forward around that, but we're making progress and we'll continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive profitability. So that's a high-level response. I don't know if there's something else you want me to drill into, but that's a high-level response. Yes, the follow-up is more specific. I mean, look, you said it's a disappointing quarter. Your returns are well below where you want them to be, and variable revenues and variable costs, not so much your efficiency ratios go the other direction. So I mean I think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the benefits of what you might get on the expense side. Okay, you're scaling back Consumer. As I asked you last quarter, you said you were losing money, so maybe you lose less money. The headcount reduction should allow you to save money. So can you ballpark the benefits to expenses from the moves in Consumer and the headcount reductions? And along those lines, now that you've moved capital well above the regulatory and your own firm's target buyback, so cost and buyback, kind of what to think about for 2023. Sure, Mike, let me take that. So unpacking a couple components. So we exercised a headcount reduction earlier this year. Approximately 3,200 employees left the firm. The run rate expense associated with that group was approximately $475 million, and we expect the benefit in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. Beyond that, we have a series of noncompensation expense initiatives. We're setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efficient levels of noncompensation spend. The narrowing of the focus in consumer is important. There are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the offering and capabilities of that, but the focus is now narrow. And then finally, as you identify, we have more flexibility with respect to capital deployment, which we intend to take advantage of. We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. I just wanted to follow up on some of those questions for Mike. And just really be honest, kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter, just given how elevated the expenses were. So I guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inflexibility, revenues down 20% for the full year? And I understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was -- it was a remarkable year. Some of it even identified or segregated as special, and therefore shouldn't be expected to repeat. So the -- was the discipline fully there? Are you doing enough on comp? You have reiterated the focus on efficiency, but the results here in -- I get it. Nobody is buying Goldman today for 2022 results, but still, the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year. So Brennan, a couple of questions. As for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that's the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. So that's what explains the time frame in which the expense is going to be booked. As it relates to compensation expense, variable expense flexibility in the fourth quarter, I guess I would point out a couple of things. One, the overall comp and benefit expense were down 15%. We had grown headcount by 10% additionally. And when you -- that's over $2.5 billion of less compensation and benefit expense, so it's a meaningful number. And if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money, are impacted by inflation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our firm on behalf of our clients. And we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees, face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. But ultimately, it's a balance. And we have excellent people. We depend on them to deliver for clients. The market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we're in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. Certainly, we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward, and we want to make sure that we're positioned to capture that. Okay. All right. Denis, I appreciate that. This one might end up being moved, but I just don't want to confirm it. I was spending some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of J-curve expectation and whatnot, but it seems as though exiting Marcus and the tone down, should we not even be thinking about a J-curve for the consumer business? Is that not a consideration here any longer? Because it does seem as though the cross through from the breakeven even ex provision has been a lot longer than expected. So should we just forget about that chart given the pivot? Or does that still remain part of the consideration? So a couple of things I would point out. As people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the Platform Solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. So we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate, and we expect to derive a lot of benefit at scale. But as we've discussed and you'll observe, we also continue to build provisions as we scale some of those activities. And so our focus remains singularly on driving towards profitability of this segment, but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate profitability. And we do look forward to trying to help people understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at Investor Day. We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Great. I guess just first one to zero in on Transaction Banking here in platforms. $325 million for Transaction Banking and other in 2022 is up 50% year-over-year. So you guys have really had great growth from scratch just a couple of years ago, but still obviously immaterial. So I just want to talk a little bit about how you feel like progress is going in that part of the business. Can this get to a multibillion-dollar business just doing kind of what it's already doing? I know you just launched in Europe there. Really just trying to think about kind of the execution road map for that part of the business. Sure. Thanks for that question. Now we're very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business, and it's a business that has particular benefits as we scale activities on it. We have our tech platform up and running. We continue to grow our clients on the platform. They unanimously continue to give us the feedback that it is a very differentiated and attractive platform to be part of. And we have taken that business, as you say, from its inception to larger scale. We think there's a lot of potential for that business on the forward. And we're very focused, at this point in time, in continuing to drive deposit balances, continue to drive our customer count, further penetrate. As you mentioned, our international expansion continues. We've opened in our fifth country. We now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world. There are true benefits to the network effect of a business like this with global reach, and we continue to see very, very good opportunities for this business. Okay. Great. A follow-up here just on the market's financing opportunity. So that's already obviously been a nice part of the story for Goldman. What do you need to do to grow financing further? Is it just a lot of the same kind of blocking and tackling? Or are there specific things you could point to that could drive kind of another step function there? And then just kind of more near term, you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and declining through the quarter. Has that changed at all, just to start this year with risk appetite that's maybe a bit better today than through most of the fourth quarter? Yes. A couple of comments I would make. So I think as it relates to the FICC financing, we have a very good opportunity set in front of us. The progress that we've made with the client franchise and our market shares, and given the overall backdrop and the availability of financing in the world right now, our clients continue to come to us. And given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel incremental financing activities in the FICC business. On the equity side of the equation, obviously, asset markets moved around quite severely, particularly in the end of the year, which drives prime brokerage balances. But as you know, we are also working very hard to reduce our financial resource footprint, particularly our G-SIB level. That brought with it significant RWA reductions. And it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth, certainly in the fourth quarter. I think as we turn the page on a new year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity financing activities, and we have less constraints given that we've now achieved the 3% G-SIB target. We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. I wanted to expand upon the new Slide 7. And as you look at the different buckets and asset classes, how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fund raises and closings? And I was hoping you could maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for subsequent funds, meaning the size increase that you've typically seen for second or third funds from the previous one, to give us a sense of the momentum you're seeing in that business? Sure. So we always have a very, very broad portfolio of funds. And we've been in this investing business for a number of decades, and it's one of the contributors to our position as the #5 largest active asset management firm in the world. And across the portfolio of different funds, we have some extremely mature businesses. Our GS Capital Partners, equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds. We have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. And we continue to diversify and expand our offering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand. So as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global, broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many different types of investors, many of which are very, very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer. Okay. And then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the FICC and trading backdrop. It sounds like you're through kind of the optimization of RWAs, but maybe can you talk about where you see, on the broader intermediation side, the backdrop -- maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share opportunities into the rest of the year. Sure. So we continue to focus on market share. Market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year, it shows that we continued to grow market share in those businesses, sales and trading. So that remains a very, very core focus of the firm. We continue to make progress, and we think we can make incremental progress. One of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of different business lines, which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. The last year, given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world, were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business, the commodities business. Meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities. Certainly, if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications on the investment-grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there's a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new offerings that we should be able to capture, given the investment that we've made in the client franchise. So I can't predict exactly where activity will come from 2023. Certainly, some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022, but it's quite possible that certain activities that were softer in '22 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023. We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You mentioned continued interest in Asset & Wealth Management deals kind of over time. It sounds more like bolt-on -- but I guess just are you more open-minded towards maybe a transformational deal as we think out, not necessarily this year, but just in the next couple of years? I mean, to date, you've -- what I would characterize, I think most people had characterized, you've piecemealed some deals. You've done some organic expansion and mixed results in different areas. But just thoughts on maybe more openness to something transformational down the road. I think we've been asked this question. I appreciate the question. We've been asked it a bunch over time. I think in certain businesses like Asset & Wealth Management, there are significant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform. We have the fifth largest active asset manager in the world now that we've stood up all the businesses inside Goldman Sachs. And so that scale is real, and there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale. And certainly, there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more significant. I would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. There are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it. Certainly, over the last 5 years, the prices have been eye-popping, maybe we're in a different environment where, well, that will normalize. But we're always open to things that we think can strengthen Goldman Sachs. But also as somebody that's been an M&A banker for a significant part of my career, I know the bar to do that, the cultural issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very, very high. So I'd say we're always open, but at the moment, our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us, and we think we can drive good returns, good book value growth, good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate. We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. David, in your opening comments, you gave us your 3 priorities of growing management fees in the Asset & Wealth Management business, maximizing the wallet share and growing financing activities in Global Banking & Markets and then scaling the platform. In the number two, maximizing the wallet share. Can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share, both in investment banking and markets? And how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years? Yes. So we -- you can take a look at our performance in these businesses, and you can see that the performance is quite strong. A couple of things I'll point to. Even in this quarter's performance, you can look at our relative M&A revenue performance, you can look at our relative FICC performance and even our equities performance in what's been a tough quarter. The relatives look pretty good. We set out 3 years ago, and this was a big structural change. We had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business. We had always thought about them in our investment banking business. And we really -- we brought that ethos into the markets business. And I know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how 3 years ago, we set out to say there are 100 clients that contribute meaningfully to our FICC and Equities businesses.  And we are top 3 with only 44 of them. We are now top 3 with 77 of those top 100. And now we have shifted the focus to really look at, okay, top 3, but why aren't we 1 and 2? What are the number of clients that we can be #1 and #2 with? And we think there's more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing in FICC and Equities on that #1 and #2 position. In banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. That footprint grows candidly has been a little bit expensive when there's been 0 capital markets revenue, because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity, but we think that will serve us well if you take a 3- or a 5-year view looking forward. So again, there's a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we're investing in. The core of the firm is very strong. Those wallet shares are strong but we still see more opportunity, and we're laser-focused on continuing to execute on it. And I don't think there's any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business, so we'll continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward. Very good. And then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy in the Consumer business, you've been very clear, obviously, on how you're positioning this going forward. I may have missed this, so I apologize. But what went wrong? When you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses 3 years ago or so, I know Marcus deposits has been around longer than that. But when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out, what went wrong? Well, I think there are a bunch of things that went right, and there were some things that did not go well. I think we executed well on some things that we didn't execute on others. But the simple thing that I would phrase, Gerard, and I think it's a fair question, is we tried to do too much too quickly. And of course, in the environment that we're in, it's hard to go back when we started in that strategy 6 years ago. We obviously built the deposit business, the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. And I think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes. One of the big changes that's affected the pace of the ability to do this and it's different in scaling things like this is CECL is a big change. CECL changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch. So we've had to adjust to that. The regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years. But I think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, was affecting our execution. I think we probably, in some places, haven't had all the talent that we've needed to execute the way we've wanted. We're making adjustments on that, but by narrowing down the 3 core things that we're going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the firm, I think we've got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward. And so that's what we're doing. And I -- the takeaway I'd like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things and we pivot. We're not married to things. We're willing to change. I think when I go back to our 2020 Investor Day, and I look at what we laid out during that period of time, we've accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things we've laid out. That doesn't mean there's not more work to do. But you know what? We didn't execute perfectly on some. So we've taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments. And that's kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of Goldman Sachs that I want to amplify. We're always willing to make changes. We're always going to be focused on shareholders. And even though everything has not gone perfectly, again, I'd point to our 40% book value growth since our Investor Day, and I'd map that out. Our book value per share growth, I believe it's more than double the next nearest competitor. So we're going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long term. I think we're good at nimbly making adjustments, and we'll always be very clear to [indiscernible] when we get things right or we get things wrong. We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for investment banking. I appreciate Denis' comments. We've seen a big increase in debt issuance, so some improving liquidity in the debt markets, at least. Is that, in your mind, a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs? And just generally, how are you thinking about the outlook for investment banking? Yes. Sure. I think one of the things we're dealing with, and it's overamplified in our very capital market-centric business, is that 2021 was not normal. The second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. They were way inflated by the massive fiscal stimulus that created kind of, I'd call, on the spectrum of activity, excess activity, pulled a lot of activity forward. And then because of market disruption, we've tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. It's the first year in over 50 years that both fixed income and equity markets were down. We had the S&P down 20%, the NASDAQ down 30%. You had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. And when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. My historical experience would be that period of time is kind of 4 to 6 quarters. And so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly, for the next couple of quarters, they're still thinking about $100. But if it's at $70 for 4 or 5, 6 quarters, then it's $70. And suddenly, when you look ahead and you think about either an M&A transaction or financing, you have more realism about the reset of values. So I think we're well into that journey of a reset in expectations. I think it might have another quarter or 2 to further reset, but I think we're starting to see some additional improvements. People point to the investment-grade debt market. That would obviously be where it would come first. But my expectations would be in the back half of '23, meaningfully better. And also, it's interesting, and I'll be heading to [ Dallas ] tonight with others, but I was watching some of the commentary -- the macro commentary. People are softening their view of 2023. And I'd say it's getting a little bit more [ dove-ish ], a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or 2 ago. And that, too, will affect capital markets opportunity because it's really tied to confidence. So I think we're going through that. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed. I think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. But you shouldn't look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn't look at 2021 as normal. The normal lies somewhere in the middle. Right. And maybe just a follow-up on the reserve and provisioning. That's obviously been a big drag in profitability as you grow the platform business. But as you shrink Marcus, is there also any desire to kind of slow? I know you -- GreenSky is growing on balance sheet, but the rest of the business, is that slow? Do we start to see provisioning slow, and given how high your reserve levels already are? Just trying to get a better picture on how to think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels. Sure. So -- as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we've implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. And so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. That being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. So that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully as things develop. You notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. That's a function of what we've observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. And so we've made some adjustments, which reflect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward. At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Since there are no more questions, we'd like to thank everyone for joining the call. And certainly, if additional questions arise, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon and seeing many of you at our Investor Day on February 28. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Hopefully, everyone can. Well, thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. Before we do our normal -- I'll walk you through a short deck that explains the intellectual rationale about what we're doing -- and where we think the industry is headed over a longer-term run. In short, we think there's ample evidence that there really have been structural changes in the airline industry that set the entire industry up for higher margins than we had pre-pandemic. First, while the specifics of the demand environment will be different, we expect it to return to at least 2019 level -- think it could go higher. Second, we believe cost convergence among all airlines as well as supply challenges may drive structurally higher industry margins. And finally, United has been pretty accurate about the macro outlooks, impact of COVID and what the recovery would look like going all the way back to February 29, 2020. And based on that, United really did take a different and unique approach to the recovery.  At the onset of the pandemic, we acted first and we acted more aggressively than anyone else to protect our airline and the jobs of the people who work at United. At the time, in fact, some said that we were overreacting that the pandemic wouldn't be so bad. But by confronting that reality and acting quickly, our leadership team was able to be the first airline to move forward, turning crisis into opportunity and begin making plans for big investments in United's futures, while others, frankly, were still in crisis response mode.  It clearly had a head start on planning for the recovery and you're already seeing it in both our absolute results as we've achieved our 9.1% adjusted pre-tax margin ahead of schedule and in our relative margin results compared to the rest of the industry. On this next slide, you can see what industry revenue has looked like as a percentage of GDP, overtime. A few interesting points. The industry still has about 15% domestic revenue growth left to go just to get back to 2019 levels here in 2023. Our base case, 9% and 14% margin target assume that we just get back to the 0.49% ratio. In the 1990s and 2000s, however, revenue to GDP was even higher. As you'll see in the next few slides, we think that cost convergence may drive revenues higher than 0.49% and for what it's worth, every single basis point of domestic increase translates into about 1 point of margin for United. On Slide 5 and 6, I'll address what I think is the most significant structural change to happen to the industry in a long time for a host of reasons. We believe the industry capacity aspirations for 2023 and beyond are simply unachievable. That's just like 2022, when the industry capacity was 7 points lower than initial guidance, and we believe the same thing will happen this year for the same reasons.  We've talked a lot about the pilot shortage, which is just one of multiple constraints. We, along with Delta, American and Southwest alone, are planning to hire about 8,000 pilots this year compared to historical supply in the 6,000 to 7,000 range. Pilots are and will remain a significant constraint on capacity. Post-COVID, all companies, including airlines and the FAA, need to staff at higher levels. Lower experience levels combined with sick rates that are elevated because of COVID and new state legislation that makes it a lot easier to call in sick. We believe in the airline that tries to run at the same stepping levels that it had pre-pandemic is bound to fail and likely to tip over to melt down any time there are weather or air traffic control stresses in the system. OEMs are behind on aircraft, on engines, on parts. Across the board, there are supply chain constraints that limit the ability of airlines to grow. Finally, the FAA and most airlines with the exception of the network carriers have outgrown their technology infrastructure and simply cannot operate reliably in this more challenging environment. Taking all of the above into the consideration. We think, at United, we need to carry at least 5% more pilots per block hour than pre-pandemic. And in addition to that, air traffic control challenges mean our taxi and in-route flight times are elevated and growing.  So the same number of block hours probably produces 4% to 5% fewer ASMs. Put it together, we need 10% more pilots and 5% more aircraft to produce the same number of pre-pandemic ASMs. Like it or not, that's just the new reality and the new math for all airlines. I think, however, we may be the only airline that actually figured this out and likely the only airline that has included this in our 2023 CASM-ex guidance already. And to be clear, all of these issues also impact United.  The reality is that the airline industry is probably the most complex operational industry with 5 bars, the highest safety and regulatory standards of any industry in the country and COVID hit our industry harder than others, all of us, airlines and the FAA lost experienced employes and most didn't invest in the future. That means the system simply can't handle the volume today, much less than anticipated growth. At United, we also missed our capacity target for 2022. We had our own challenges over a year ago during Christmas of '21, Omicron hit us all hard, but it also shown a spotlight on other strains in the system. We responded by proactively pulling down capacity. It was the only choice. You can't change the engines on an airplane when it's flying. We flew a lot less last year than we'd have liked to fly, but we did it intentionally because it gave us the breathing room to make even further investments in our technology and infrastructure and to increase our staffing levels. And we had a huge head start compared to most airlines because we started with much better technology and infrastructure. But also importantly, we got to acceptance quickly and didn't spend much time in denial about the structural changes. We accepted that the structural changes were real and moved quickly to what to do about it. On that point, I also fully recognize that most or perhaps all of our competitors, will get on their calls next week and tell you onetime event, no big deal, no change to our capacity plans. If so, I think they're just wrong. It's intellectually hard. It takes time to get through the denial phase. What happened over the holidays wasn't a onetime event caused by the weather, and it wasn't just at one airline. One airline got the bulk of the media coverage, but the weather was the straw that broke the camel's back for several this keeps happening over and over again. And you can see that despite good weather, ULCC still hadn't recovered even as we entered the new year. The operational difficulties are just the latest among numerous data points proving the systemic challenges that are going to limit the growth in flights. As you can see on the data on Slide 6, United's hub locations mean that we pretty much always have the worst weather. In spite of this, we're able to lead the industry because we're doing a lot of things differently than we did historically. We made significant additional investments in technology and infrastructure. We're running with 5% to 10% staffing buffers. That means we need more pilots, data agents, rampers et cetera, to fly the same schedule. We're running at about 25% more spare aircraft than we did pre-pandemic, and we're flying lower aircraft utilization. All of those obviously cost money, but it's clearly the right thing to do for our customers and the most -- among the most things we can do to win their loyalty. And it's turning out these buffers are much less expensive than the cost of avoiding the otherwise inevitable operational meltdowns. And their forward guidance, other airlines are likely to talk about returning to 2019 utilization efficiency, et cetera.  But we believe that just wrong. Our industry has been changed profoundly by the pandemic and you can't run your airline like it's 2019 or you will fail. But don't take my word for it, watch the data. United will always have the toughest operating environment. Any airline that's operating meaningfully worse than United is out over their skis and has simply outgrown their technology, infrastructure and resources. Slide 7 transitions to the unique setup on the international front. This is one of the most stark examples of what United did differently than our competitors. Over the pandemic, we bet international would return strong, post-pandemic. And because we were the only airline around the world with that view of the recovery. We were also the only airline to make 2 important strategic decisions. We didn't retire wide-body aircraft, and we were the only airline in the world that negotiated a deal with our pilot union to keep pilots in place and in position, that allowed us to quickly bounce back. The decisions that our competitors around the globe made to retire aircraft and downgrade pilots take years to reverse. And because of that, they simply can't grow and you already see that in this summer's capacity data. On Slide 8, I've already hit on the theme, so I'll try not to belabor it here, but United had a conscious strategy to use the pandemic to invest in the future. Our large aircraft orders were just the latest example of this. New plans are big-ticket items that get lots of attention. But other investments we've made in technology, infrastructure and people haven't drawn big headlines even though they too are essential to our success. The point here is that we really were unique. It wasn't just one thing and it wasn't just aircraft. It started with the fact that we always believed in a full recovery. And as a result, we invested and invested early. On Slide 9, everything about this deck hopefully gives investors some comfort on why we have confidence in our margin targets. But I think there's potential for margins to go even higher, making Slide 9, the money slide for this entire deck for me at least. You can have whatever view you want about capacity, but what really matters is cost convergence. It's already happening, and I'm pretty sure it's going to continue. I believe a world where ULCCs pay their pilots significantly less than us, yet they can still hire and retain pilots, and they can somehow operate with previous staffing utilization levels is just the [ nonsense ], it's not a realistic scenario.  And with cost convergence, if I were a betting man and actually I am, I'd bet that the revenue to GDP ratio is going back to the mid-5s. We'll see, and again, we expect to hit our margin targets even at the 0.49% level. But if it is true, I believe industry margins will go even higher. That's not our official guidance to be clear, but it's certainly possible.  And so to conclude, I think the pandemic led to a structural change in the industry. The supply-demand dynamics are different than they've ever been in my career. I realize there's a lot of investor skepticism on that, but every data point keeps demonstrating it over and over again. And because United saw this ahead of everyone else, we were able to invest and prepare to take advantage of it. To be clear, I think margins across the board are going to be higher in the airline industry. But because of the unique steps we took to prepare for exactly this kind of recovery, you're also already seeing United's relative performance is as strong, and I expect that lead to just expand. A huge thanks to the entire United team. You're really doing an amazing job, and you are making United the biggest and the best airline in the history of aviation. And with that, I'll hand it off to Toby, who'll explain some of these critical investments, why they were important to the success of our operations through the most difficult holiday operating environment in my career. Toby? Thanks, Scott, and hello to everyone tuning in today. I first want to thank our employees for their exceptional performance over the holidays. We faced a really challenging operating environment that included some of the busiest days of the year and historical cold weather across most of our hubs and line station. While you wouldn't know it from the holiday travel headlines, United was actually the most impacted airline from a weather perspective. 36% of all our flights were exposed to severe weather between December 21 and December 26, more than any other airline in the country.  And even though our load factors was already high, we accommodated thousands of additional customers on short notice when their travel and other airlines was disrupted. Despite these headwinds over the holidays, our team connected 90% of our customers within 4 hours of their planned arrival and served more than 8 million people, 1 million more than we did last year, and our operations performed very well, especially considered these tough conditions.  United was among the airlines with a fewest cancellations during the holidays, and we were #1 in completion in Denver, San Francisco, Houston and Washington Dulles, and we practically eliminated all the related challenges and cancellations compared to the 2021 holiday period. So how did we do it? The answer lies in all the planning and investment we made during the depths of the pandemic. Instead of just trying to run the airline like we did in 2019, we worked over the last 3 years to prepare for a different, more complex operating environment and a sudden surge in travel demand. To prepare specifically for the 2022 holiday period, we purposely built some slack in the schedule and reduced how often we fly during peak times. We accelerated our hiring and added staffing buffers in key locations. We built firewalls to prevent individual weather events from spilling over into broader network. And finally, we beefed up our training in every department, including clearing out the pilot training backlog to be resource ready for the peak travel demand season.  Again, as Scott said, our work to prepare goes back even further. Over the last 3 years, United invested in systems, training, tools and technology that would empower our employees and benefit our customers, including a modernized cruise scheduling system with 800% improvement in performance, capacity and security versus 2019, a smarter schedule and operations coordination to build reliable and operable schedules. Additional spare aircraft in our fleet, upgraded technology infrastructure supporting our network, operations, airport operations and maintenance teams. Together with our industry-leading customer-facing technologies like ConnectionSaver and Agent on Demand, both of which now are integrated in our mobile app. Some of these investments are obviously more marketable than others, but they all make a difference in our performance. Finally, I want to point out the biggest difference maker for United this holiday season, our frontline teams. They worked as one team. They volunteer to pick up extra trips and work over time and again, break record-setting cold temperature. It was the combination of their dedication and the proactive investment in technology and infrastructure that led to our success. And with that, I'll hand it over to Andrew to talk about the numbers. Thanks, Toby. TRASM for the fourth quarter finished up 25.8% and PRASM up 24.6% versus the same period in 2019, on 9.5% less capacity. This was similar performance to United's third quarter results and above the high end of our TRASM guidance for the quarter. TRASM growth or non-passenger revenue continued to outpace PRASM in Q4, although that will reverse in 2023, the reversal is due to cargo revenue declining year-over-year to new post-pandemic run rate that remained well above 2019 and co-brand credit card revenue growing slower relative to our rate of ASM growth for the year. PRASM in Q4 was strong across all parts of the network versus '19, with domestic results, up 23%, Latin, up 30%, Europe, up 11%, and Pacific, up 42%. International capacity in the quarter was down 12% and domestic was down 8%. Looking back at our revenue performance for all of 2022, our overall TRASM performance comparing to '19 was up 19.5%, about 6 points better than our expectation for the rest of the industry on average at this point and 3 points better than our network competitors during the same time period. To meet our overall 2023 outlook, we're expecting flattish TRASM for the year versus 2022. The impact of cargo and other revenues on TRASM in '23 is a negative 2 to 3 points year-over-year, implying PRASM up about 2 to 3 points in our outlook. As we think about the revenue outlook for 2023, we are bullish about global long haul. We expect industry capacity across both the Atlantic and Pacific, where United is the largest carrier to be flattish versus 2019, which provides for an easy setup and positive RASM year-over-year.   International demand remains incredibly strong, and we're looking at the potential for record profits and margins across our global network. Asia has traditionally been a margin drag on our global flying, but we've worked diligently to rebuild the network and close this gap. And we think 2023 will validate that we accomplish that goal. Asia is also close to being fully opened, allowing United to reestablish the bulk of the specific flying outside of China. It's worth noting that restrictions on the use of Russian airspace will constrain United from flying both of our China network in 2023. This same restriction will also limit our ability to fly to India. While I would not normally provide revenue details about the months within a quarter, I think it's important to share what we are seeing in Q1. Our unit revenue outlook for February and March is largely consistent with the levels we've seen in the past 3 quarters at roughly 25% higher than '19. We believe January is a negative outlier in Q1 with unit revenues compared to 2019 softer than the months after it. We think this is primarily due to holiday timing with less demand for incremental weekend trips, enabled by hybrid work schedules, so soon after the year-end holidays.  But we expect the second half of February and March to be back on trend with booked revenue already 30% to 40% above the same period in 2019, and I think this validates our excitement for 2023. Overall, we expect our Q1 TRASM to be up approximately 25% year-over-year. Another positive catalyst for 2022 revenues is the continued, but slow recovery of traditional large corporate business travel. While November and December were low relative to October, it's great to see that January is materially better by about 5 points versus the average for Q4. January represents the start of a new budget year for most, so it's a great way to start the year. And we've heard often that budgets in 2022 were exhausted early as to why November and December travel were a bit disappointing for large corporate travel. I talked about the great setup we see in global long-haul earlier. We also see a nice setup for our domestic operations as constraints across the industry are everywhere, creating a favorable supply-demand environment. United is also now quickly executing on United next plans focused on gauge, premium seeding, revenue segmentation, signature interiors and most importantly, restoring and building connectivity, which suffered during the pandemic. We're opening 17 new mainline gates in Newark and 20 in Denver in 2023, which will enhance our customer experience and improve reliability. In Denver, the new gates will allow us to grow our most profitable hub. And in Newark, the new gates will allow us to transition more flights to mainline from Express consistent with our United Next plans. In addition to gates, we opened more United Club space. In Newark, we have 69% more Club space and Denver will be up 180% versus 2019. We also have expanded Club space in Chicago by 40% with a new club that opened last week, and in Dallas by 43%. Most of these Club projects will soon be online and were planned during or prior to the pandemic. Importantly, there are more projects on the in the years to come. Looking beyond 2023, we continue to implement our United next plans. We've adjusted our upward -- our long-term gauge plan so that by 2026, our North American gauge will be up 25% versus 2022 and 40% versus 2019. United continues to be undersized in gauge as we await delivery of our large narrow body planes that are largely absent from our current schedule, creating a margin gap versus our potential and versus others that have a significant fleet size in this category. Activity suffered in 2022 due to a reduction in RJ flying capabilities and delays from Boeing. Pilot staffing at our regional operators has stabilized since pay changes went into effect, essentially matching one of our competitors combined with our Aviate program that provides a 4-year transition plan for pilots from an express job to a United mainline career. Regional jet utilization is showing signs of improvement, but we still have a long way to go, and it will be until about 2025 or beyond to get to normal. We have also signed a new agreement with Mesa to expand our large RJ flying in 2023 and associated small community service, while our relationship with Air Wisconsin comes through a natural end. With this change, the number of regional partnerships is reduced from 6 to 5 and will eliminate approximately 40 single-class 50 CRJs that were not part of our long-term plans in exchange for adding dual-class 70 CRJs, a clear win for United, small communities and our customers. Rebuilding connectivity will be a key focus in 2023 and 2024 and will be significantly additive to RASMs as it was in 2018 and '19, giving us confidence as we do it with optimal gauge this time around. Thanks to the entire United team. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gerry to discuss our financial results. Thanks, Andrew, and thank you to the whole United team for closing out the year strong, with adjusted pretax income of $1.1 billion, we came in ahead of our fourth quarter expectations and not only returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability, but actually exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019 on both an operating and pre-tax margin basis. Even more encouraging, in the second half of 2022, we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of 9%, which matches our margin target for 2023 and puts us well on our way for that same success this year. Turning to costs. Our CASM-ex performance in the second half of 2022 meaningfully improved versus the start of the year. As I mentioned last quarter, a big driver of this success is the return of a grounded 777 to flying and further improvement in our operational reliability. As we know, a well-run operation is a more cost-efficient operation. Looking ahead, we expect first quarter 2023 CASM-ex to be down between 3% and 4%, with capacity up 20% versus the first quarter of 2022. On a full year basis, we expect 2023 CASM-ex to be about flat with capacity up high teens versus 2022. This full year cost outlook is inclusive of investments in the system that support operational reliability, our current expectations for new labor increases, representing about 4.5 points of CASM-ex, excluding any possible signing bonuses, and a higher inflation outlook for all parts of the business. On the first point, one lesson learned during the pandemic recovery is that it is both economical and profit maximizing to provide cushion to our aircraft utilization. Instead of pushing utilization to its theoretical limit, we are focused on protecting our reliable operation. This minimizes delays and cancellations, which would otherwise drive higher costs, such as overtime and customary accommodation costs. Turning to our expectation on profitability. As Andrew mentioned, demand remains healthy. As a result, and using the January 10 forward curve for fuel prices, we expect our first quarter 2023 adjusted pre-tax margin to be around 3%, resulting in an adjusted diluted earnings per share between $0.50 and $1. Additionally, building on a successful second half of 2022 and with industry dynamics, Scott described at the start of the call, we feel even more confident about achieving our United Next 2023 adjusted pre-tax margin target of 9% and expected adjusted diluted earnings per share between $10 and $12 for the full year. On aircraft, we currently expect to take delivery of 92 Boeing 737 MAXs, 2 Boeing 787s and 4 Airbus A321neo aircraft in 2023. Assuming all these aircraft are delivered, we now expect full year 2023 total adjusted capital expenditures to be around $8.5 billion. Even with this elevated level of CapEx based on the capacity, revenue and cost guidance we've outlined, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive for the full year. Looking beyond 2023, last month, we announced an aircraft order with Boeing that included 100 firm 787 aircraft, which will address much of our wide-body replacement needs through 2032. We also received options for up to 100 additional 787s that can be used for growth if there are margin accretive opportunities to do so. Additionally, the order included 100 incremental 737 aircraft to both meet planned United Next targets and start preparing for narrow-body replacements in 2027 and beyond. Our aircraft order book is one of our key assets as it provides us with both cost-saving replacement aircraft and the ability to take advantage of profit-enhancing growth opportunity. The cost of the flexibility built into the order book, we can also adjust the delivery timeline as the macro economy dictates. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with liquidity of $18 billion and reduced our adjusted net debt by $3.3 billion versus year-end 2021. We continue to balance liquidity levels with deleveraging activity and financing opportunities as we expect to end the year, having met our 2023 target of adjusted net debt to EBITDAR of less than 3x. We're entering 2023 with a strong foundation, and I want to recognize all of the hard work that has gone into running this great airline. We look forward to delivering to our customers, employees and investors in 2023. And with that, I will turn it over to Kristina for the Q&A. Thank you, Gerry. We will now take questions from the analyst community.  [Operator Instructions]  Candice, please describe this procedure to ask the question. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. There's been some pushback just on the 2023 jump fuel guide and just trying to get comfortable with the link between cost and revenue. So RASM is the highest it has basically ever been. And even with the capacity constraints out there, industry capacity is now being added. So what gives you the confidence that you might pass along additional cost headwinds on to customers in the current environment. Conor, let me provide a little bit of color on that and maybe Andrew will, as well. But first of all, we -- when we provide our fuel guidance, we did this quarter, what we always do, which is we look at the forward curve about a week ahead of the release. So last week, those numbers, as you know, can change daily.  In fact, if we had run it more recently, we would have put out fuel numbers, potentially $0.10 to $0.15 higher. All things being equal, that would represent about a point of margin, but we are -- we continue to remain confident that there is the correlation between revenue and fuel that we've seen historically. For the first quarter, near-term, we don't have quite the same ability that we would have during the full year. But even for the first quarter, we still have February, March and fuel will change daily. And for the full year, we're still comfortable that there is this correlation. And in fact, had we put a higher fuel number and there probably would have been a different revenue number.  But let me just give you an example that gives me some comfort. But keep in mind that for the back half of 2022, where we achieved a 9% margin, fuel was $3.68. So we do have a lot of cushion. And I don't know if Andrew has any additional color. No, I think you covered it really well, Gerry. The -- we absolutely still do believe and have seen constantly, overtime, that fuel is a pass-through on both the up and the down. And the other thing I can tell you is, as we look at our advanced bookings, particularly starting in the mid-February time period, out well beyond that and into Q2. We're in a really good, strong supply-demand equation that's allowing our RM systems to actively work to do what they do best. So I feel really confident about the outlook. Okay. And then just on the United Next plan. So when you guys talked about that originally, it was all about leading on costs, and I realize the environment has changed a lot since then. But as you start to look at the cost structure that includes labor and so on. Is your expectation that this -- like that United becomes a cost story, again, going forward -- in the -- post-2023 world going forward. Well, Conor, there's no question there's been an industry reset on costs, and I think Scott did a nice job sort of describing that and the cost convergence ahead. For us, if you just look at our guidance we put out about 6 months ago for 2023, there's been movement. There's no question, probably about 9 points, 3 points of that is just the capacity difference between what we thought 6 months ago versus what we're thinking today. Another 3 points in the labor numbers we put in, the rest is inflation and buffers. But what's important for the United Next plan is the relative cost story, which remains very intact. So whether it's the mainline gauge benefit we're seeing, we will see from all the additional aircraft or less reliance on single-class 50-seat aircraft that have come out and will continue to come out of the operation. We're very comfortable in the United Next cost story, as it's been adjusted for the industry cost impact. Our next question is from Catie O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Maybe just coming at the revenue question a little differently, maybe for Scott or whoever else wants to answer. How do you think about getting back to airline revenue as a percentage of GDP? I think that makes a lot of sense conceptually, but do you think the industry gets there on pricing if volume versus GDP is lower, given the capacity constraints we talked about? Well, I mean if you go back and look at history, while load factors have gone up a little, I wouldn't expect a lot of change in load factor. And if you went back a few years, pricing in real terms, was higher than it is today, it remains a great value. I mean, air travel prices are probably 50% lower than they were about 30 years ago in real terms. And you can still frequently pay more for your Uber to the airport than you do for your airline ticket in Florida.  And so I think -- but I think that what this means is the era of $4 prices from Los Angeles to Cabo and $7 from New York to Florida or $9 from Houston to Central America are probably a thing of the past. And cost convergence -- except the other airlines decide how to price the product. But I'm pretty sure it's not after them what's happening to their cost structure. And as that is changing, we see it happening already. It is what happened last year. It's what changed last year. We see that continuing, to Andrew's earlier point, too. I look at the data as well and following our revenue management team is doing a great job. But the yield curve for February is higher than January. The old curve for March is higher than February and the yield curve for the second quarter is higher than March. And by the way, bookings were ahead in all periods. So I think it's a structural reset. I think it is the investor store or aviation, I think, it's good for everyone. I think it's particularly good for airlines like United that have this sophistication, the technology, the infrastructure to operate in this more challenging environment. But it's good for everyone. And it's just a structural reset that's reversing what happened over the past couple of decades, at least a possibility of it. I think it's likely, but we'll say at the least a possibility. I live in New York, can definitely confirm on the Uber versus the airfare of late. So somewhere there. And obviously, a lot has changed, as we just talked about since the original United Next plan, particularly how the capacity bottlenecks we've been talking about have played out. How should we think about capacity growth over the next couple of years? Are you still targeting to be about 40% bigger in 2026, based on that 4% to 6% CAGR or help us reset the bar? I'll try that. I don't think we're going to reset the bar here. Obviously, this is really dynamic. And the OEM delivery delays, both on engines and aircraft have been really unprecedented. So we're not going to re-guide today to what 2026 looks like other than we're plotting our course in very bumpy skies when it comes to the availability of aircraft. And there's not a quarter that goes by where I don't get an update with obviously disappointing results from what our outlook looks like for aircraft deliveries. So we'll continue to monitor that. And at the appropriate point in time, we'll update the guidance. I think the important point is we have real confidence in achieving our 14% margin under sort of all the plausible scenarios for aircraft deliveries. Next, we have Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Gerry, a question on the labor cost assumptions, the pilots in the 4.5 point headwind. Do you expect the pilot economics to be backdated to January 1? Or are you using some other date? And also related to this, the EPS guide do you also consider Delta's profit-sharing formula to be market? Jamie, nice question, but neither one of those we're going to be able to talk about on the call. You're asking for too much information regarding potential negotiations. Okay. Second question for Scott then. On the topic of cost conversions, I think you said that the ability for discounters to maintain a significant wage arbitrage is narrowing or impaired. I didn't quite get your language. But if we look at the Spirit and JetBlue TAs, yes, they're incrementally expensive, but the resulting wage advantage to, let's just go with Delta here, it's still pretty much the same. So were you implying that the arbitrage has to narrow even more? Or did I misunderstand? I'm saying, not implying that I don't think a world where they pay meaningfully less and still hire and successfully fly and complete their schedules. I think that's the [ nonsense ] . I don't think they can do it. And one of the other ULCCs has really been struggling this year with a completion factor, which at least had us internally wondering if they had pilot shortage issues because system has been really pretty good. There was a 1-day FAA outage, but the weather has been good, and they've been consistently having problems. And then 8 or 9 days ago, they put out a $50,000 signing bonus for pilots. And look, however you want to calculate it, however you want to look at it. And if you're interested, I can give you some more real-time facts, like I've watched the data closely. And it's not happening. I mean what happened over the holidays wasn't just at one airline. And at all the airlines that had challenges, you can look at our data that we put out, you want data for what's happening right now, I can tell you some more stuff.  But there are a number of airlines who cannot fly their schedules. The customers are paying the price. They're canceling a lot of flights. But they simply can't fly the schedules today. Maybe it's pilots, maybe it's something else, maybe it's technology, maybe it's infrastructure, but what I'm confident of, the big 3 -- and by the way, I think JetBlue has invested in this, the big 3 and JetBlue are operating at a different level than everyone else for whatever the reasons are. Next is Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Scott, thanks for that kind of early intro to the call, pretty extraordinary set of kind of facts, an argument you laid out there. What does this mean for the industry kind of longer term? Kind of it's really unusual to see an industry, to your point, try to grow in the phase of the restrictions that they have like this. I mean how does this end? I mean do you think there's going to be like regulatory scrutiny on kind of airlines trying to grow when they can't, and that's hurting service? Or what happens next year? Well, I think what it's going to lead to one way or another is less capacity. You just -- it's not mathematically possible for all the airlines to achieve their aspirations. And now I'll just give you the data. I'm not trying to pick on these 2 airlines. But like this seems so blindingly obvious to me. And we talked about it a year ago, we were right all this year with capacity coming in 7 points lower, and I feel even more confident that we're right today.  And the data I'll give you is, snowstorm started, pretty big sandstorm started in Denver yesterday afternoon and continued through this morning, 11 inches of snow, that's a tough operating environment. There's 3 large airlines -- there's 3 airlines, 2 in addition to United that have big operations there. Yesterday in Denver and our mainline, we had a 100% completion factor, so no cancellation -- 12% of their flights, the other one canceled 27% of their flights. Starting off today, we've canceled a little less than 1%. Each of them have canceled 33% of their flights, like this isn't new. And there's like a dozen of the Wall Street analysts that breathlessly publish a weekly report on industry scheduled capacity. You guys are looking at the wrong data. If you want a forward indicator, of what's going to happen with capacity, you should watch completion factor. One of you should start looking at completion factor because airlines that are running like that, it means they can't fly their schedule, and they're going to have to adjust one way or another. That's my thesis. That's what happened last year, it's what I think is going to happen next year.  And all of the structural issues are multiyear, I mean, all of them are 3 years at best to address. And you put all of them together, this is a long-term structural issue. And I think it challenges us too, but we just did more to invest for that future. So coming earlier than others and are better prepared to deal with it than everyone else. But it does challenge us too. But really like don't take my word for it, don't take the others' word for it, just watch the data. That's what's happening with completion factors, and that's going to tell you whether we're right again this year or everyone else is right when they say they're going to achieve the aspirations. Just maybe one follow-up. I think the point on corporates running out of budgets towards the end of last year was an interesting point. Do you guys have much data on kind of what '23 corporate budgets look like to avoid a similar situation this year? I don't. What I'll tell you is that the reset looks very good as we head into January, obviously. So we're really pleased with those numbers. October was a really good month for corporate and January is tracking at that or above that. And so we'll see where we go from here. But I'll tell you, this is an important number for United. We monitor it a lot and it's moving in the right direction. And we're highly confident, particularly for long-haul global that we're going to get back to full strength, and that's an enormous tailwind, I think, for at least airlines that rely a lot on corporate travel. Next we hear from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Just on the interrelation between fleet and CASM, if we just back up in time, you announced a big fleet order in June of 2021. I think that's when you unveiled United Next. And your target for this year was down 4% relative to '19 on CASM-ex. You updated those views. Obviously, we had less capacity, inflation, et cetera. So you went from down 4% to up 5%, another big fleet order in December and now the outlook is plus 15% versus 19% versus your initial down 4%.  So I guess the question is, given the constraints that you articulated very well, why does this investment rate still make sense? If you can't grow at the rate that you hope to grow, why invest at a rate that assumes a much higher growth outlook at some point? Well, to be clear, I think we can grow at United. I don't think the industry can grow for all the reasons that we've set. I think at United, we can grow. We are clearly able to hire pilots, pre-pandemic, like most we ever hired was about 900 in a year. We were right at 2,500 last year. Our team -- our flight training team has done an amazing job.  There was a lot of work to do to get that training machine humming. It also helped that we had in our foresight to build 14 new simulators during the middle of the pandemic when everyone else was pulling back and shrinking. But that's part of the -- that's one of the probably the most complicated thing that airlines are struggling with, and we have that machine on here in Houston at the flight training center and we acquired 4,000 flight attendants this year. We opened a new flight training center, another investment we made last year. I mean, really, the point is we invested to be able to grow. And I think we can grow. We have the other benefit of, we're taking 300-plus regional jets out of the system. So that creates a natural slack in terms of departures. If you got FAA, air traffic control issues. If you're a single fleet type airline, you buy all A320 family or all 737s like you don't have anything to take out to give you room. We do have 300 aircraft were to take out. But really, the point is all the investments, I mean, like one of the investments that I like that speaks to the foresight that we had coming into this was Clubs, and we increased our Club space by 48% during the pandemic, like that's always a challenge.  Trying to close Clubs when they're full in a constrained airport environment, it's always tough on customers like the pandemic was once in history, not once in a generation, once in history, a chance to do that with minimal impact because we didn't have nearly as many customers flying in 2020 and 2021. And we're the only ones that did it. And -- like there's just stuff like that everywhere that United did differently. So to be clear, while I don't think the industry can grow, I think -- we think United can. My guess is because of the OEM -- our full target because those will be behind. We're going to be flying a lower utilization than we were before, and there's going to be less regional. So we probably won't be all the way to our target. But I think we can uniquely grow and expand margins in this environment when everyone else can't, and it's because of all the investments we made to set up for this. And obviously, hindsight is 2020. It's been a unique set of circumstances. But I guess the question is, had you invested at a rate more aligned with your DNA where there's real free cash flow to point to here. How much higher with this CASM outcome have been? In other words, if we're up mid-teens relative to 2019, could you have invested at a much more modest rate and gotten to the same outcome. And I appreciate your thoughts on it. I think if we -- I mean, look, if we invested -- if we had done the same thing everyone else did, we could have the same problems we have right now. Instead of canceling 1% of our flights today in Denver, we'd be canceling 33%. That's higher cost. Our costs would be higher. This isn't just investment like -- anyway, I think when you get to the end of the year, add dollars to donuts, we have the lowest CASM, the best CASM performance.  I've recognized other people have better guidance and then maybe they will have better guidance. But I think in the real world, we've come to grips with what the real world means and how -- what you have to do to operate it. And you can see it in the data -- excuse me, operating stats, you can see it in the financial stats. And it's a new world. You can't run the airline like you did in 2019.  I remember, I read all the transcripts. And I read one of the transcripts, and Jamie asked someone, I don't remember which airline it was, but asked someone when are we going to get back to pre-pandemic normal. And I don't remember who it was or even what they said because I immediately thought the answer to that question is never. And I don't think anyone else just figured that out yet. The answer to that question is never. It is a new environment, it's a new industry. And that creates higher costs. It does, but it's also creating higher revenues. And I think it's going to lead to across the board, higher margins, but particularly for United. Our next question is from Dave Vernon from Bernstein. Andrew, I just wondered if you could sort of tell us about what's embedded in the TRASM guide for being flat? I know you mentioned PRASM was up 2% to 3% cargo down. What are you expecting out of the card program and the other revenue line as we think about '22 to '23? We're still expecting really strong results, but it's just -- it's not keeping up with the ASM growth that creates that negative headwind. But our card program is doing really well. Our partnership with Chase is just top-notch, new members into the MileagePlus program relative to where we were in 2019, I think, were up about 50% in the same time period in 2022. So all of that's moving in the right direction. It's just not keeping up with ASM growth in 2023, which creates that inversion between PRASM and TRASM. And obviously, you understand the cargo part of that. Okay. And then maybe, Scott, just to ask the question, that just kind of came up as you're talking about the challenges around the industry having to reset its cost structure. Do you see any risk that as you're kind of looking out and building the revenue plan around your own cost structure, setting fares at a level where you can recover that cost pressure that the rest of the industry maybe doesn't get there. I guess if the rest of the industry isn't quite recognizing what the cost pressure of operating in the new normal is going to be, do you think they're going to be under pricing and potentially creating some problems for you to absorb some of the costs that you're building into the network? Well, if they're right, I don't think they are, but if they're right and they can return to 2019 utilization and efficiency than we can to. That will be easy to just go back to flying. So no, the short answer is no. I'm not worried about it because if they are right, it will be really easy for us to just fly the aircraft a little harder. And because we're growing within a few months, just slow the hiring down and within a few months, you'd be back, to be clear, I think that's extremely unlikely to happen. But we could adjust our cost structure down if it turned out that we were wrong, and that's the new normal, pretty easily. Next, we have Andrew Didora from Bank of America. I just kind of want to go back to fuel for a second, just because it has dominated my conversation so far. I guess when you think about it conceptually, looking at your 2023 guide, it seems like you're assuming fuel was going to $2.70 per gallon 2Q to 4Q. And Gerry, you said fuel is a pass-through. So I think that's down like at least 30% from current market. Just how do you underwrite that kind of 2% to 3% PRASM growth in 2023, if fuel is coming down? Let me start. Look, what I'd tell you is that I do think fuel is a pass-through in both directions and that it is dynamic on when we picked the number and we adjust the revenue forecast for it. But more importantly, where we are in terms of demand and supply and cost convergence, as Scott spoke about in quite a bit of detail, has just given us, I think, significant ability to utilize our revenue management system to make sure that the price points are where we need them to be.  And we did that all through last year. And in fact, we did that all throughout the entire pandemic, where we led the industry, I think, 11 out of 12 quarters. So we feel really good about where our revenue performance is. We feel really good about where our bookings are. We feel really great about our Q1 guidance, and we feel really good about where the RM system is currently managing price points for Q2 and beyond. We definitely believe in the GDP relationship. It is converging, and it's converging for all the reasons that Scott talked about earlier. So we feel really bullish about the outlook and the ability to achieve the revenues that we need to achieve. Got it. Understood. And then, Andrew, you gave some pretty robust booking figures for February into March and kind of your whole outlook. Any color that you can provide in terms of how you're thinking about 1Q by region, which regions might you see accelerating, which decelerating from here? Just kind of get a sense of how you're seeing the world right now. Sure. I'll give it a try. I will say that I started with earlier, the global long-haul environment where capacity ex-United is negative and capacity with United is just slightly -- about at 2019 levels relative to where GDP is this year, provided just an enormous set up to hit a home run on TRASM on our global long-haul network.  So we couldn't be more bullish about that. And I mean, simple, right? Supply is flat versus '19 and the propensity to travel along with the economy and GDP is dramatically higher, that sets up a very good opportunity for RM systems, and they're actively working to do that. and bookings for spring and summer look really strong. So to Europe, I just think it's going to be another record RASM and margin year based on that setup, and it looks really good. Across the Pacific, the same exact capacity set up, by the way, where it's slightly negative without United and about 100% with United relative to 2019 capacity and a very similar setup, but we also have the opening of China and all 3 markets, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, ultimately. And we think there's going to be a significant bounce back in demand like we've seen in Korea and Australia and other places in the region. The only, I think, thing we're watching more carefully is Japan where the numbers look really good, but it's based on U.S. point of sale at this point and not Japanese point of sale. We expect the Japanese point of sale to kick in later this spring and summer. So that one has been slower to rebound. But again, U.S. point of sale just had an enormous, I think, pent-up demand and is ready to fly and is doing so -- really covers the numbers.  Once Japan comes back online from a point-of-sale perspective, I think that further strengthens that as well. Latin America, near Latin America is the best I've ever seen it from a TRASM, RASM type perspective at this point. and Deep South America is also very good. It is just not nearly as good as the amazing performance we're seeing in Clubs in Latin America. So the setup for our global network is, I think, unbelievably good. And it's really a very simple math, and there's very little capacity growth out there and a lot of GDP.  And if you look at our capacity guide, while we haven't given you an international and domestic breakout, you can look at what we're selling. And you can see how we've leaned into it for 2023 to make sure we maximize the profitability of the airline. And we think that we've done that very well. Domestically, I also want to say, Scott, talked about this cost convergence. We talked about the capacity constraints. What people think they're going to fly in 2023 is not what will really be flown, that happened in 2022. We think that's going to happen in 2023. And given where we think total revenue is and ASMs will be less than that. We think there's a chance for a positive RASM domestically as well. And it's a really good setup. So across the globe, amazing setup here at home, also a very good setup for a positive outlook for the year. Next is Helane Becker from Cowen. So just one question here. When we look at air fares and we compare, say, premium economy to where business class was pre-pandemic, it seems like the price points moved to that level, right? So you have some economy fare. Then you have a premium fare in economy that seems to be equal to what business was, and you seem to have business that is significantly higher. So, a, is that observation correct, and b, what's your paid load factor in the front of the cabin? There's a lot of numbers you put out there, Helane. What I'll try to say is that paid first-class load factors, particularly here domestically are up a lot. They're up 6 points. And so our RASM growth in the first-class cabin versus the main cabin, domestically, is 15 points higher. So it's doing incredibly well, which we're excited to see, obviously, because of our move towards more dual-class aircraft and monetizing the premium cabins. On our global long-haul fleet, I think it's a little bit different than maybe what you said. The public price points may be exactly what you said, I don't know. But the performance, I would say, is that Polaris is not back to where we'd like it to be just yet. But the middle cabin, the Premium Plus cabin is and better and the Coach cabin is and better. And so the RASM performance on board the aircraft is a little bit more tilted towards the back of the aircraft or the middle of the aircraft on the global long fleet than it is to front. And why I'm also particularly excited about this recovery in large corporate traffic is that is how we tend to fill the front of the aircraft. And so the trends we see in January looked just really good. And that also is a positive TRASM tailwind to the global network as we do a much better job of filling up Polaris with higher quality yield than we did in 2022. And I'm confident when we end 2023, we'll be able to report that the Polaris paid load factors and paid yield are much closer to their 2019 baseline than they were in 2022. Okay. That makes perfect sense. And then just for my follow-up question. I'm not sure whether you said that or Scott said this, but if '22 -- if nobody flew their capacity original plans in '22, which they didn't, and they do it in '23 and the infrastructure issues, and I don't see the government rushing to invest in air traffic control.  In fact, I see it getting worse. I don't see the FAA investing. As you think about this, does '23 get worse than '22 and '24 get worse than '23? And doesn't that accelerate to the point where you can't -- the industry just have more because you run out of space. Pretty close to yes, is the answer. We're near the limit on capacity -- on flights in the system. There are places that are at the limit, and we're near. And you can see it, like it works fine, and you can add more on good weather days when absolutely nothing goes wrong. Something goes wrong every week. I mean there's weather, there's systems issues that happens at the FAA, that happens at the individual airlines, there's pipelines that get cut for fuel at airports, there's vendors that fuel airplanes at airports that are short-staffed or have higher sick calls, just the stuff that happens every day. And we're near the capacity limit, in terms of total number of flights. And Scott, we should add to that though, what you said earlier that we're getting rid of a large number of regional jets. So the departure activity that we're planning from our 7 key hubs in 2023 is  still materially behind where we're in 2019 from a departure level. The ASMs are a whole another story, as we've talked about because of what we're doing with gauge. But we've created the room in our hubs to be able to execute our plan. We have sufficient runway and gate space to do so. Our next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. I got one near-term and then one bigger picture question. Just when I just look fourth quarter to first quarter, the RASM guide, the implied revenue guide just worse than normal seasonality. Just given everything you were saying about February, March bookings, just help square with the revenue and RASM guide, please? Yes. What I would say is that we definitely see a different set of numbers for like January 6 through February 15 than we do beyond that. And as I think about it, it's our hypothesis that we do have a bit of a different type of seasonality, post-pandemic, than we did have pre-pandemic. So it just depends on the year -- the quarter-over-quarter, year that you're looking at. But look, the trade-off would be every weekend is potentially a holiday, allowing us hopefully to be able to de-peak the summer and run a more constant level of operation from mid-February all the way through October, that's really exciting and a lot more upside than maybe a few weeks in January that don't look as good as they used to be. So I think the trade-off is fine. But our hypothesis at this point, it is a different type of seasonality related to a post-pandemic environment. Okay. And then, Scott, so bigger picture, if you're not getting the unit cost leverage from capacity growth that maybe you thought you would have gotten a year ago, I guess why grow so much and risk adding too much capacity to the market and risk pricing  and maybe just ask differently, if you didn't grow as much, do you think you'd still hit the 9% margin, but at the same time, just generate better free cash flow? Well, to be clear, we're focused on margin, not CASM. We're focused on margin. And while we aren't updating upgrading our margin guidance, we're already way ahead of the Street. I think everything we had in our deck today and everything we've talked about today certainly creates a plausible case that margins are going to be higher for all the reasons we've talked about. If we were not growing, I think our margins would be lower.  I mean, clearly, it would impact our CASM. But I think the capacity that we're going to add would be soaked up by someone else. And I think that -- anyway, I think our margins would be meaningfully less if we weren't doing what we're doing. And so we're doing it because we think this is a -- look, I think this is a once in the history of the industry opportunity. This is an event that's never happened before.  And I get that most of you on the sell side disagree. And I accept that you disagree and -- but I think the world has changed and the industry has changed. And by the way, we do have a lot of flexibility. And what I would say, you didn't ask this as a question but what I would say is if we're not -- if there's some reason that where it doesn't look like we're going to hit our targets, if we're structurally missing our targets, if we're underperforming the industry and missing our targets, we won't do all this growth. I mean we have a ton of flexibility to move aircraft around. And we won't do it. So it isn't just like -- and the torpedoes. This is as long as it's working, we're going to keep moving. But I will tell you, I have a pretty single data point, increases my confidence at least it's working. So look, we had with the highest pre-tax margins and fourth quarter of the big network carriers at least.  We amazingly enough, if you look at -- actually, we had the highest free cash flows in 2022 with the lowest net debt if you use traditional GAAP accounting with operating leases and include pensions, we had the lowest leverage ratio like I mean, it's working. If you look at our operating results, what's happening in Denver today, like it's working. So we're not going to change, of course, on something that's working. But if it stops working, then we absolutely have the flexibility to adjust. [Operator Instructions]  First up is Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Just curious if you're benefiting at all from book away from Southwest after the holiday meltdown and also if you're benefiting from pilot attrition coming from Southwest. And second question, do you see any impact from many travelers that are cashing in on their miles this year that they might have built up during the pandemic? And does that help or hurt you? I'll give it a try, Leslie, it's Andrew. I think we're benefiting from running a world-class great global airline. When we look at the data and particularly not over like one week, right, over -- or 1 quarter, when we look at the data over the last year plus, our team has been just hitting the home run and the data shows it. So I think we're really proud of where we're at. We intend to keep that online. We have the appropriate buffers to make sure we can continue to deliver for our customers going forward, and we shall. In terms of frequent flyer growth, what I'll say is the program is incredibly healthy. The redemption rates are quite normal, given where we are with inventory availability and our customers are using their miles to fly all over the world in the largest global network of any U.S. carrier. And on the pilot front, what I'd say is it's an amazing change. I tried to get out to the pilot training center and see new hire classes, and we're hiring 200 a month, and I've started asking where they come from, show of hands. It used to be like from any of the large airlines, ULCCs, LCCs, big airlines, hardly any because you had to give up seniority to come. We now have a high percentage of people in those classes that are coming from all airlines. And I think the reason is because United has -- if you're a pilot -- well, if you're anyone and you aspire to a career in aviation, United is a place to go.  We're well on our way in to be the biggest, but also the best Andrew talked about the brand, the reputation that matters a lot to people. Our pay rates are going to always be vary, depending on the timing of contracts, but always basically going to be at the top of the industry. If you're a pilot, United has the most growth opportunities and most opportunities, the fastest path to captain.  The most widebodies of any airline by far in the country like we're the place to go. And people are actually giving up their seniority at all of our competitors for the opportunity to come and have a future that's a testament to what all the people of United have accomplished and how bright we feel like the future looks. Next is Alison Sider from the Wall Street Journal. Just wanted to ask about the FAA outage last week. And I don't know how you're thinking about that. Is there a concern that there are other sort of these systems that are vulnerable or that you think of as single points of failure and how you're thinking about it? And what kind of conversations you've had with the FAA since? So I think this ought to be a wake-up call to -- for all of us in aviation, something -- many of us in aviation have been saying for a long time that the FAA needs more resources. By the way, I think they do an amazing job. During the Christmas struggles with the weather, a bunch of great things that they did. But 2, in particular, the -- water main break that flooded the tower in Newark and the same thing happened at one of the towers in Chicago, and they really quickly moved into backup facilities and kept the operation running. I mean, just a lot of people jump through a lot of hoops and deserve a lot of credit for that. But the hard facts are the FAA's budget, in real terms, it's lower than it was 20 years ago. But the amount of work that they've been asking to is significantly higher. Huge resources devoted to space launches, drones, thousands of people were working on aircraft certification programs in the aftermath of the MAX disaster. And so they've had to rob Peter to pay Paul.  And they were asked to do more, and they're doing it with less money. There's fewer controllers than there were 30 years ago. And it's people, it's technology. And look, here in the United States, we should have a world-class best aviation system in the world. And we're putting at risk if we don't invest in it. And this is infrastructure. It was great that we passed a bipartisan infrastructure build. This ought to be bipartisan as well, by the way, that we passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill. But this isn't concrete, but modern systems, modern technology and the right number of people for the FAA is an infrastructure investment that will pay dividends many times over for the country. And so I hope that this is an opportunity for us to look at this just like we looked at the country at the infrastructure bill in a bipartisan way, get the agency, the resources that they need because we have asked them to do more, and we'll all be better off. And then if I could ask one more just on restoring flights to China. Are there like approvals either in China or the U.S. at the government level or like diplomatic things that need to happen in order to ramp that flying back up? There are. At this point, United Airlines holds the rights to fly 4 flights per week to China. We intend to convert our current one-stop service to nonstop sometime in the next few weeks, hopefully. But we do not hold rights at this point to increase our service any further. And I believe that is an industry-wide type of situation. So at this point, there's no green light to go beyond what we're currently flying. Next is David Schaper from NPR. I appreciate guys doing this, this morning. A couple of questions I had have been asked and answered. So I'm going to kind of shift gears into something that might be coming out of blockfield. But the Biden administration announced last week, a plan to get the transportation sector down to net zero emissions by the year 2050. I know the aviation industry has that goal as well. But how realistic is that really? And what is the cost to an airline like United to try to shift to sustainable aviation fuels to possible hydrogen-powered engines, that sort of thing? Well, I haven't seen the details of their plan. But I think as a global citizen, it's probably the most important thing that our generation needs to accomplish. I'm proud at United that we are not -- we are the leading airline around the globe on real sustainability initiatives, and we are one of the leading corporations. We are focused at United, but I think it's the right focus for aviation on a number of fronts. One, unsustainable aviation fuels, by the way, the build back -- or the Inflation Reduction Act has a number of provisions. Regardless of what you think about everything else in the act, the sustainability provisions are meaningful, not just for our industry, but for everyone. And I think our transformative legislation makes it viable to start making investments in hydrogen and SAF. And we've been the leader and we've got even more coming, but a lot of projects that are going to be hard to do, all of a sudden start to pencil out, at least potentially pencil out.  And so I think it's driving a lot of investment, and you can expect more from us on that. A lot of excitement in electric aircraft, what we're working on there. And while I can't replace everything because it's never going to be big airplanes flying long distance. It will be a part of the solution. And then finally, carbon sequestration, I'm a climate change geek and have been for 30 years, and I used to have conversations like this.  It wasn't too long ago, even just a couple of years ago, and I would have to explain what the word sequestration meant. It's real progress actually that people know what it is now and there's more investment. We're here in Houston. Occidental is our partner in a sequestration project. They're a leader on that -- in that front.  But a lot of others are moving into sequestration and the 45Q changes that happened in the Inflation Reduction Act are also really consequential for carbon sequestration. So I'm more encouraged today, I think, than I've ever been at the possibilities, but it's a lot of hard work ahead, and it doesn't happen overnight. I mean there's not a magic silver bullet. But I'm also proud that United is leading, and we partner with everyone that would include the DOT, anyone that's interested in doing the right thing and solving this in a real way. We're happy to be partnered with. Just a quick follow-up. What is the cost of all this, especially if governments, not just the United States, but governments globally start imposing mandates to ship to alternative fuels that they cost a lot more to develop in use? Well, I think what we need to do is drive the cost down. And so the -- for SAF, for example, what I like to think about is wind and solar energy, which because I've been a climate change geek for 30 years, I followed it, but it was 20 years ago, certainly 30 years -- 20 years ago, everyone, everything you read or talked about wind and solar was, it could never compete with fossil fuels, it could never be economic. Well, guess what? We passed legislation that had credit a caret instead of just a stick caret, that caret drove massive investment in R&D, it filled economies of scale.  And today, it's cheaper to produce a megawatt of electricity from wind and solar than it is from fossil fuels. And the same thing can and I believe will happen with South. It is more expensive today. But we are in the very early phase of the development curve. And that's what's great about the Inflation Reduction Act is it creates those same kind of financial incentives that existed for wind and solar.  And that is -- we know it because we're involved with the companies. It's driving investment into the space. And that's what's needed right now at this phase, and that investment is going to lead to breakthrough, it is going to lead to economies of scale. And I think the costs are going to come down. Our last question is from Bill Murphy from Inc.com. I have 2 quick questions. The first, I believe if I understood Scott previously, you mentioned an unprecedented number of new pilots actually coming to United from other airlines. And I understand, of course, hiring especially, but not limited to pilots as a big industry constraint, a big effort. So -- but I'm wondering, can you say anything more about that? Is this an effort specifically involved here now to recruit away from competitors in a way that you haven't in the past? And if so, how do you go about doing that practically from -- besides simply positioning the airline is a good place to work? And I would have a follow-up. It's really the latter. It's not a targeted airline to go after, but people pay attention and United is the best place to work and if you're a pilot you want to work at the best place. A lot of them are just putting their applications in. We don't need to do anything more than be the biggest and the best airline in the history of aviation, and that's enough of a sell point. Okay. So no specific numbers to report on that you've had an uptick in that? Well, I don't know what the numbers are. I might give an anecdote, I asked people and I would guess that 30% of the people in those classes come from one of the large airlines. That's just my eyeballing it in the room, but somebody at United probably knows the numbers, but I don't know the specific numbers. I'm just proud of everything the team is doing. And if I can -- just my other follow-up here. In previous calls and interviews, you've talked about kind of changing customer demographics, including things like the rise of work from anywhere of leisure passengers. I'm just wondering if you have anything more to add to that now in terms of how you see that changing structurally in the post-pandemic world. It's a really interesting trend, and we saw it again over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. For example, for Thanksgiving, we saw a lot of people leave dramatically earlier for their vacation than they would normally do. And this year, Saturday, because we left early, Saturday was actually one of our biggest return days, didn't display Sunday, which is obviously always the biggest.  So a completely different pattern. And we saw that throughout the entire second half of last year, and it's really exciting for our business because it allows us to de-peak things ultimately, run the airline differently and more efficiently. And remote work, while I'm sure, will evolve and adjust overtime, which is driving this. Remote work does seem like a permanent feature in our workplace here in the country. And so we're optimistic that this continues to be the trend based on everything we've seen. And it really is just -- it's a different type of demand. It's a different industry, and I think we're well prepared for it. And it's very exciting from a capacity and revenue management and customer point of view across the board. I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Munoz for closing remarks. Thanks, Candice, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. Please contact Investor or Media Relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."

         "Greetings, and welcome to the Prologis Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference will be recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Jill Sawyer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Thanks, Diego, and good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.  These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and items; Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim. Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Let me begin by thanking our global team for delivering an excellent quarter and year. We've had outstanding results despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets and the overall economic backdrop. In the face of this, our focus has been to serve our customers and investors putting our heads down and executing on our long-term plan. As you see in our results, our portfolio is in excellent shape, driven by still strong demand and a continued lack of availability. This foundation for our business not only drove our nearly 13% increase in year-over-year core earnings, but it also sets up the company for sustainable growth for years to come. Turning to results, core FFO, excluding promotes, was $4.61 per share and including promotes was $5.16 per share, ahead of our forecast.   In the fourth quarter, our operating results, again, generated several new records. Occupancy increased to 98.2%, with retention of 82%. The Prologis portfolio, excluding Duke, added 30 of the 40-basis point increase over the quarter. While we tend to quote occupancy, it is notable that the portfolio is 98.6% leased, a record that underscores the tightness across our markets. Rent change for the quarter was 51% on a net effective basis. The step down from our third quarter rent change of 60% is a reflection of mix and not market rents.   In fact, market rent growth exceeded expectations during the quarter, increasing our lease mark-to-market to a record 67%. These results drove same-store growth to 7.7% on a net effective basis and 9.1% on cash. The Duke portfolio, having closed on October 3, is fully integrated in these results with the exception of same-store growth, which will not be reflected until the first quarter of 2024.   On the balance sheet, while access to the debt markets have remained challenging for many issuers, we successfully executed a number of transactions during the quarter, raising over $1.1 billion at an interest rate below 3%, including $700 million of new unsecured borrowings out of Japan and Canada. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent, and we've maintained over $4 billion of liquidity at year-end with borrowing capacity across Prologis and the open-ended funds of $20 billion, expanded significantly due to our balance sheet growth from the Duke acquisition.   With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottom line is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%.   Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all-time record. And deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.   While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet, and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline.   Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late '23 or '24. In Europe, we expect deliveries to outpace absorption by approximately 30 million square feet, expanding the current 2.6% vacancy rate to approximately 3.5%.   Finally, and as expected, our true months of supply metric grew to 25 months in the U.S. from 22 months last quarter. As a reminder, this metric has averaged roughly 36 months over the last 10 years. In Capital Markets, transactions continue to be slow in the fourth quarter, making price discovery challenging. That said, return requirements are trending to the low to mid-7% range. This expansion further affected appraised values in our funds, although continued rent growth has mitigated some of the effect.   Our U.S. values, which were appraised by third parties every quarter, declined 6% this quarter and 7% over the entire second half. In Europe, values declined approximately 12% during the quarter and 16% over the half. Our open-end funds have received only modest redemption requests, less than 3% of net asset value during the quarter, totaling 5% across the second half. Our flagship funds have strong balance sheets with low leverage, largely undrawn credit facilities, cash on hand and undrawn equity commitments.   While we believe the value declines over the second half reflect market, investors are still adjusting to a new environment. Because we strive to be consistent in our actions and fair to all investors, we will redeem units call equity and resume asset contributions when price discovery has run its course. We expect that to be 1 to 2 quarters away likely sooner in Europe. This will ensure certainty, fairness and consistency to all of our investors.  Turning to our outlook for 2023. While our macro forecast assumes a moderate recession, which may put headwinds on demand, our business is driven by secular forces and long-term planning by our customers that should limit the impact unless such a downturn becomes significant and protracted. As mentioned earlier, we believe vacancy will build in the market and our portfolio, both of which are unsustainably low. Putting this sentiment together with our outlook on supply and demand, our '23 rent forecast calls for approximately 10% growth in the U.S. and 9% globally.   We acknowledge that our rent forecasts have proven conservative in recent years, but we are comfortable with this starting point given the environment. Specific to our portfolio and on our share basis, we expect average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, roughly 50 basis points lower than the '22 midpoint. Combined with rent change, we forecast to generate net effective same-store growth of approximately 8% to 9% with casting store growth between 8.5% and 9.5%.   Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increased over '23, ending the year between 65% and 70% and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. We expect G&A to range between $370 million and $385 million, reflecting not only inflation in wages and other corporate costs, but also additional investments we are making in our Essentials business particularly in the energy teams.  In that regard, we expect the contribution to FFO from Essentials to range between $0.07 and $0.09 this year. This reflects 70% growth in revenues and tax credits from '22, but offset in the near term by our higher Duke related share count and the G&A investments just mentioned. In terms of operational metrics for the business, we expect to add 115 megawatts of solar power over the year driving the portfolio to approximately 540 megawatts by year-end. It's worth noting that we closed 2022 as the second largest on-site power producer in the U.S., a position we will build upon with our plan for 1 gigawatt of production and storage by 2025. We also forecast to have over 20 EV charging clusters installed and operational by year-end.  In deployment, we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to new starts. We have over $39 billion of opportunities to select from in our land bank and between our expectations for build-to-suits and logical markets prospect, we see an active year of starts initially to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion with a real opportunity to grow as conditions warrant.  As mentioned earlier, we plan for redemptions to be cleared out over the year and private fundraising to resume. Accordingly, we forecast contribution activity to occur primarily in the second half and resulting in combined contribution and disposition guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion. Finally, in strategic capital, we forecast revenues, excluding promotes, to range between $500 million and $525 million, which is impacted by valuation write-downs across '22 and the first half of '23. We are forecasting net promote income of $0.40 based on an assumption that you -- that values in USLF, primary source of '23, promotes will decline further from values at year-end. Every 1% change in asset value equates to slightly less than $0.02 of net promote income. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO, excluding promotes, to range between $5 and $5.10 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents approximately 9.5% growth over 2022. We're guiding core FFO, including promotes, to range between $5.40 and $5.50 per share.  In closing, this guidance builds upon an exceptional 3-year period of sector-leading earnings growth. At our 2019 Investor Day, we presented a 3-year plan, targeting 8.5% annual growth, we achieved nearly 14% over this period, 550 basis points of annual outperformance. We expect 2023 to be a year where headlines continue to be disconnected from our business and ability to deliver strong growth and value creation. While there are many unknowns generally, there are more knowns in our business that are clear, such as our lease mark-to-market; significant and visible opportunity in our land bank; a need for excitement -- a need and excitement for a new generation of sustainable energy solutions; and a dedicated team that is the best in the business and laser-focused on delivering leading results.  We'll now turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Tim, I just wanted to clarify, in your kind of going through your guidance, you throw out a lot of numbers. I just want to make sure on the mark-to-market, numbers that are embedded in your same-store NOI growth of 8% to 9% GAAP and 8.5% to 9.5% cash. Just -- what are you expecting for cash and GAAP leasing spreads? And I just want to make sure that's different than the kind of overall portfolio mark-to-market, you talked about 65% to 70%? Yes, they're going to be stronger. As you think about the lease mark-to-market, it's all of the leases. So it represents old leases and leases just done. So clearly, everything that will roll next year is going to be above the 67% reporting today. It's a little bit flatter than you might expect as we've looked at it. I think leasing spreads next year are going to be in the high 70s to low 80s on a net effective basis. And then as we know that the cash basis of that has trended towards about 1,500 basis points or so inside of that. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. I just want to hit on the capital deployment side of things, maybe a 2-parter here. Just first on the stabilization, just the kind of the -- what you guys have stabilized the $2.8 billion at your share, can you just bridge that gap versus the $5.5 billion that you have on Page 20 of expected deliveries or completions in 2023? And maybe just give us some sense of timing on that. I know I think about 30% of those are build-to-suits. So also how you're thinking about where the pre-leasing is on the balance of that as well and kind of how that layers into your occupancy assumption? Yes, I'll take -- Craig, it's Tim. I'll take the first half and Dan can help with the second. This is really a date issue, I would say, not even an issue, but just a function of the date. We have a large amount of that group of stabilization, we believe will occur in the first quarter of '24. And I think there is a very real possibility that if we improve some of the leasing timing by just a month or 2, we could see a decent amount of that actually fall back into '23. So it's just a function of crossing over a calendar year, the lay -- the mix of all of our projects is landing. And this is Dan. I'll just pile on there. The pre-leasing in that portfolio, as you see, there's 29% of that, that's in there as a build-to-suit. The pre-leasing is better than that 29%, and I would say on track with historical averages, even on a bigger data set here. So we feel really good about delivering our stabilization at this year-end and next. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. I was curious about the investment capacity that you show in your supplemental of $1.5 billion is down from $4.2 billion. I just want to understand what that actually represents? And tying that to your comments about contributions perhaps picking back up if conditions settle out, how does that comment compared to the $1.5 billion capacity? And how much rigor room do you ultimately have an increase on that capacity? So what I would do with regard to investment capacity is relying more on the way I'm describing it in our prepared remarks, the $20 billion and $4 billion or $5 billion across the funds. The number that's presented in the sub, which is what I think you're referring to is a bit technical about the current amount of equity that can be drawn in the funds, and then that number is levered slightly. So that's why it's a bit understated. The number we supplemented with in prepared remarks is looking at the overall leverage of the fund and how much more capacity sits beyond just that of committed equity post leverage. So for example, our USLF venture is very low leverage, just about 10%. And that creates an incredible amount of debt capacity, as you can imagine. And I think that one is addressing your second question, which is the liquidity in the funds for contributions, there's a lot there for us to tap over time. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Can you give us an update on the markets in Europe, the mark-to-market there? Any leasing trends? I think you touched briefly on the private market transaction backdrop. We definitely see the U.S. mark-to-market getting wider. I guess how do you view demand in Europe and the differences between the U.S. and Europe unfolding in '23? Yes. Let me start with some general comments. Europe is generally a mild and more muted version of the U.S., both on the way up and on the way down. And the market is -- has a lower vacancy rate than the U.S., if you can believe it. So that's a general backdrop. That's very consistent with the way Europe has behaved in the last kind of 15years. As to the specifics on mark-to-market and the like.  Dan, do you want to cover that? Yes, sure. mark-to-market -- lease mark-to-market in Europe is about 28%. And I would say just overall, we feel very good about the leasing demand in Europe right now. We talked about at the -- in the remarks about an expansion in the vacancy. But overall, we feel really good about where it's headed. And you might ask what about the U.K. because that's the one you hear about all the time. And actually, that's really strong, too, so far. So we've actually been surprised on the positive side with the U.K. The other place that is really held up well is actually Germany, which you would have guessed with energy issues would be softer, it hasn't been. And there's virtually no vacancy in Germany and some of the manufacturing coming back, particularly autos, et cetera, are really strengthening Central and Eastern Europe, the markets particularly in Poland, where there's this perennial vacancy. It's sort of tightening up. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. I want to dig in a little bit to the sectors that you're seeing driving leasing demand, let's say, in the fourth quarter and so far this year. Whether you've seen any changes in types of customers taking space versus a year ago? And then I guess when we think about the broader retailer bucket, where you did see some retailers reporting year-over-year sales declines in the back half of last year. Wondering if any pieces of that category are you seeing less demand? Yes. The only category that is significantly below the trend and is likely to be that way is housing because the starts are slowing. But with respect to other detail, Chris, do you want to take that? Yes, it's absolutely right. Generally, Nick, it was diverse. So whether we look at consumer products, whether we look at apparel, food and beverage customers. We have a diverse range of customers leasing space from us beyond the housing categories, which would include construction, it could include home goods and the like. Yes. And retail sales on a real basis, notwithstanding the weaker prints in December and November are good. I think it's between 2.5% and 3% up compared to the year before. So yes, you do hear the headlines of the weaker retailers, but I think if you look at it overall, it's actually pretty positive. It's more positive than the headlines. I wouldn't say it's super positive, but it's much better than the headlines. Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. You clearly laid out the building blocks of your same store NOI growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in 2023, where you have a high level of visibility. Obviously, a lot of macro uncertainty out there. Can you provide the specific assumptions you've used for your initial 2023 outlook? And then just where and how a change in the macro environment could provide upside or downside to your initial guidance? So let me just start that and Tim will take you through the specifics. Actually, the assumptions about the macro environment other than, call it, defaults or something that has an immediate effect, are not going to drive the numbers big time in 2023 because a lot of the leasing that needs to take place in 2023 is already in progress or been dealt with. We're dealing with very high occupancy levels to start with. There is not a whole lot of space to lease. And the real driver of those same-store numbers is the huge mark-to-market in the portfolio that already exists. So that's -- so don't expect -- even if we change the assumptions by a lot, the numbers for 2023 are not going to move that much. They will, obviously, move as you get further along into the future. So that's one comment I would make. The second comment I would make is that in every year in the last 3 or 4 years, we started the year with rental assumptions that we have exceeded sometimes by a factor of 3 to 4x. So I'm not saying that's going to happen this year, but there is absolutely no reason in the world to go crazy on our assumptions with respect to rental rates, particularly they don't have an effect in 2023 anyway. So we'll see how it plays. And if we see evidence of stronger rental growth and my bet would be a surprise on the upside of our assumptions, not the other way around. Then we'll let you know, and you can adjust the numbers accordingly. Tim? Yes, just building on that, Michael, if you -- within the supplemental, you can see our lease expiration schedule. Out of that, you'll see we have about 13% rolling, and that's a mix of what is stated as expiring, which is another 9%, but also things that we've already addressed ahead of entering the year here. So the footnotes will tell you that. You get to 13% there. SME said, start with the 67% lease mark-to-market. You've got 10% market rent growth for the year. You assume we'll get that halfway through the year. One thing we see people get wrong is that will take you to a certain amount of rent change. You actually get half that rent change this year, you get half of '22's rent change as well. That's a mathematic thing that you need to be mindful of given the quantum of rent change we're talking about lately. That will all get you to close to 9%. And then we backed off an assumption on occupancy loss, which we couldn't point to right now, but just feels prudent in the environment. So we've taken our guidance down there. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. How should we think about the organic same-store NOI growth for the legacy Duke portfolio in '23, given them that's outside of guidance? Is it lower than guidance for the legacy PLD portfolio in the same ballpark? Just given the size of the Duke deal, any color you could share would be helpful. Well, it will be lower for one reason anyway, which is that they started at a higher level of occupancy. So putting even rent aside on a same-store basis, there's less opportunity. They generally had longer-term leases because they generally have bigger spaces. So that affects the mix, but Tim? Well, I think an important thing to remember here, and we've seen some people not have this entirely correct in modeling is just understanding that on a GAAP basis, there will be very little same-store. There's potential for some, but because we mark the leases up to market now at the close, on a net effective basis, there will be very little same-store growth, and that's contemplated in our guidance. On a cash basis, I expect it would look quite similar to Prologis. By the way, if I can continue that. One thing that you didn't ask, but it's important in this context, and Dan can elaborate is that the rental performance of the Duke portfolio on the few spaces that have come up for re-leasing or were in progress during the time we were doing the transaction are trending significantly higher than what we had underwritten. Dan, can you quantify that? Yes. I actually go as far as saying we expect to outperform the operating portfolio to 11% to 13%, call it. Now 8% of that is going to come from market rent growth. So really 3% to 5% of that comes from just operating that portfolio in the Prologis platform. Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the outlook for '23 assumes a recession. And if we look back to previous recessionary cycles, usually, we get declines in consumption which drives lower demand for industrial space. But we've also never started a cycle with kind of persistently low vacancy like we have right now or tailwinds from e-commerce and supply gain reconfiguration. So kind of -- within that backdrop of assuming a recession, how do you think it could be different this time? And kind of what do you have baked into your numbers for that for '23? So given that Tim was in kindergarten when cycle started. Tim and I are a little bit different than our recession outlook, but I don't think it matters. I think Tim would tell you that if there's a recession, there's a very mild recession and my bet would be that we wouldn't have a recession, but it would be close to 0 GDP growth for a while. So call it recession or no recession, but the same outcome. I think what's different about other cycles, and I say that with a lot of dislike for the phrase that's different this time is that there were really two situations where we had negative absorption in the U.S., which is where we have data. One was on the helop.com and there you had a high vacancy rate. On top of it, you had a very low utilization rate because there was a lot of capital for these dotcom, particularly e-commerce retailers, and they were taking space way ahead of demand. So there was a lot of shadow space too. So when you add those two, it was a very, very high vacancy type of market during that time. So 2000, 2001 time frame. The next time you had a pretty significant negative absorption with 2008, 2009, and we all know the reasons for that. And there, you also started with a significantly higher vacant rate. I think it was 7% or 8% before the music stopped.  And all I can tell you is that Prologis -- the old Prologis with the fund alone had 52 million square feet of vacant spec space that they had to lease. I think AMB at the time have like 8 million or 9 million square feet. So nothing like you're talking about here, particularly given the different scale of the company and how lease we're starting out. Now even in that situation where we're normally at about 95% occupancy, we went down to about 91% in both cases. So I don't see anything near that. I mean it's mathematically impossible. Even if absorption goes to 0 right now, we don't lease any more of the under-development spec space and absorption goes to 0. I mean, you will be under 5% vacancy, which used to be considered a great strong market. And the capital up, we didn't have this kind of mark-to-market. I mean the mark-to-markets in those days were in the mid-single-digit range, and now we're talking about 70% almost. So a very different picture. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. I just had a question about market rents actually. So the 10% market rent forecast in the U.S. Can you just discuss that or break it out a little bit for us in terms of coastal versus non-coastal in terms of your expectations just in the context of supply growth that you're seeing and the demand backdrop in general? Yes, it's Chris Caton. So indeed, we expect 10% in the U.S. that's going to vary. Typical spread between coastal, non-coastal is 300 to 500 basis points, at least that's where it was running, say, pre-pandemic, and we expect a wider spread in the current environment. So whether you look at vacancy, whether you look at the under-construction pipeline, whether you look at the momentum in pricing in the back half of last year, including fourth quarter that leads you to conclude on the coastal outperformance continuing at a greater than historical average in 2023. Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. I just want to go back to some of the comments on the third-party management. I think you talked about valuations being down 7% in the back half of last year and potentially continuing into this year and the redemptions potentially ending in the first 2 quarters of the year. I just want to get a sense; any more color how are you thinking about that? Is it because the valuations have been repriced that you expect sort of the redemptions to stop? What should we be looking for to get more confidence in that? Yes. There are two things that usually drive redemption requests. One is sort of the denominator effect and people needing; and two is some folks want to arbitrage the lag between the -- how quickly the public markets adjust and the backward-looking appraisal process. In our experience in past downturns, the second has taken about 3 quarters to be fully reflected in appraisals. So we really don't want to disadvantage one group of investors. By the way, the vast majority of our investors, 95% of them, because a couple of points of people want to arbitrage that difference. So we want to make sure the valuations are right before those things transact. We think Europe has actually adjusted quicker than the U.S. And that's why we think there's maybe another quarter to go before Europe fully adjust. So we're committed to taking care of those redemptions in the next quarter. And we think the U.S. may take another quarter to adjust, and we'll take care of those in the second quarter.  Here is what's important, and people don't get about the structure of our funds. First of all, our leverage is in the low 20% range on these funds. So there's oodles of liquidity in these funds to basically be able to handle any redemption requests -- any reasonable redemption request. And secondly, we started with the Q, and we started with some cash on hand. So again, there are lots of sources for addressing those redemption requests. I think you should assume that redemptions that have been effective as of the end of this quarter, will, by and large, be taken care of by the middle of the year and sooner in Europe. So you can model that math beyond that.  Now I'll tell you one other thing, which is kind of interesting. Prologis could be a buyer up in these fronts. And in fact, even in the global financial crisis, where the old AMB was in a tighter spot with respect to leverage, we actually stepped up and bought on very attractive terms with adjusted values, a couple of hundred million dollars of real estate. And we actually offered it to our outside investors first, and then we stepped in and bought it. And you know what, the next quarter, all the redemptions went away because people realized that the people who know the most about this portfolio are buyers at these prices. So it's really about getting the values, right? And we started writing down these portfolios a quarter or 2 ago. And our appraisal process is independent. We have nothing to do about it. And that's very, very different than some of the redemption situations that we've all been reading about. Our next question comes from [ Camille Bonnel ] with Bank of America. On your development guidance, can you give us some color on how much conservatism is built into your development starts? And also, you're expecting another year of strong stabilization. What assumptions are you making in terms of timing of these projects? And is any of the increase in guidance driven by projects from last year taking longer to complete due to longer construction time lines? This is Dan. Let me start with this year's development start guidance. We're coming off our largest year of starts ever. And just given the macro headlines, we decided to take a little bit more balanced approach where we slowed our starts at the end of last year. We don't expect to start up in earnest until the last half of this year. We think the build-to-suit business will pick up at the same time. So call it conservatism, I call it discipline. And just feel really good about our approach, given the volumes over the last year or 2. And then stabilization next year, stabilization this year. Tim mentioned it earlier, we think we can outperform. What we have in the books right now, demand continues to be strong. We talked about the development starts plummeting in the marketplace in the fourth quarter. We think they're going to be slower in the first half of the year. And we think that bodes well for absorption in the last half of this year into next year. So we feel very good about our guidance. Yes. There has not been a material delay in any of our construction project, if you look at them on an aggregated basis. So that is not -- that has not shifted stabilizations from '22 to '23 or anything like that. Yes, I can't even think of an example that comes close. And even on the cost side, because we've been thoughtful about procurement and securing some of these type supplies ahead of time, that's been actually something that we use as a competitive advantage in marketing to build-to-suits because we've got a bunch of steel and we've got a bunch of air conditioning units and electric panels and things that are insured supply are already sitting in our warehouse waiting to be deployed into our land bank. So no, there's nothing funny going on about that. And by the way, the stabilizations are not just a function of completion of construction, but also leasing being stabilized at 90% or more. And that factor hasn't delayed stabilizations either. We've been leasing actually ahead of plan to this day. And I think we'll -- I expect to continue to do that. Next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. On the subject of fund redemptions, there are some unlisted funds or nontraded REITs with a different leverage profile than yours, different investor base that are seeing a significant amount of redemption requests. And I was wondering if you anticipate this will lead to increased asset sales on the block and potentially some more opportunities for you on the acquisition side. I hope it does. I'm not optimistic that it will because if you look at even the denominator problem for most institutions, and the fact that they generally have to reduce their exposure to real estate, they're likely not going to want to reduce their exposure to industrial. So I think -- and with these -- most of the open-end funds, where their mix, they are different property types, the industrial is what's holding up their performance. So for them to disclose those would put them in even a more difficult situation. So I don't think there will be a lot of for sellers in industrial because to the extent that you're dealing with a leverage issue or a liquidity issue, if you sell your highest yielding assets, you keep tightening the coverage and noose around your neck. So as much as I'd like to, I don't think we'll see a lot of that. I think where we could see opportunities is actually within our own open-end fund availabilities. If the redemptions continue and we think the values are good, first, we'll offer that to all the third-party investors and then we'll step in and buy. And we like that real estate. We know it well, and we operate it and if it's priced right, we're all buyers, no problem. Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC. I guess, Hamid, I understand that PLD in the industrial space in general are pretty well positioned in the current environment despite the uncertainty, but is there anything that you're watching out for any specific risks that you foresee for this space here in the next year plus or so? Yes. We are watching everything really carefully. I mean I'm not -- believe me, we've been through enough cycles and enough where things can happen that none of us predict that we want to be vigilant. That's why we're starting out the year with very conservative assumptions and things that we can deliver. I mean, I think even on this basis, we're going to, I think, put up unbelievably good numbers. I mean, who can think of almost whole digit kind of returns or growth off of such strong growth, 14% per year, earnings growth, consistently for the last 3 years. So I think the arrow is up. But, yes, I mean nobody predicted Putin going into Europe last year. It's usually the stuff that you don't -- you can't predict. I mean, am I worried about inflation really tanking our numbers? No. Am I really worried about recession tanking our numbers? No. Am I worried about e-commerce going out the window and people going back to shopping deals the way without that percentage going up? No, I'm not worried about those things. But I am worried about things that I don't even know what to worry about. You get my drip there? Anyway, so yes, there's always bad stuff that can happen that are out of the realm of normal projections. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. What are the anticipated yields for your 2023 development starts? Anticipated -- this is Dan. The anticipated yields are actually up slightly, but still in the low 6 and 6 1-ish, 6 2-ish. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Question on utilization, which increased in the quarter. What drove that growth given all the headlines we see about port volumes were not declining? And how big of a driver of the higher utilization is for your outlook for this year given the strong outlook this year? Yes. I don't think utilization actually moved that much. I mean the peak utilization ever, all-time, was 87%. And I think that one point is well within the sampling bias that can take place because it's not a perfect data set. It's a sample of large data sets. So I don't think there's a meaningful trend in -- certainly not a decelerating trend in utilization. With respect to port volumes, I think port volumes are pretty meaningless in the last -- really since COVID started because there were so many fits and starts and play things being in the wrong place and all that. And yes, the West Coast ports have lower volumes today than they did before, but the East Coast and gulf ports are getting a lot more volume than they did before. So on an aggregate basis, port volumes are just fine. And if you look at the lag that it takes too many empty containers on one side of the ocean, and factories shutting down on the other side of the ocean and all that. I think until the market normalizes; you can't really draw any conclusions from port volumes. So I don't see either one of those two trends affecting demand. Chris, do you want to... Yes. I'll just build on that by saying two things are also happening. One is market vacancies in the U.S. are 3.2%, 3.3% lower in Europe. That, in its own right, creates some pent-up demand. And so there's a need to push utilization within the facilities. And then second, look, inventories are up 15% on a year-on-year basis -- on a nominal basis and 9%, 10% on a real basis. So there is real structural demand, lifting new demand as well as in-place customers. Yes. Notwithstanding that increase in real inventories, we still think we're less than halfway towards equilibrium level of inventories about 45% of the way there. So we think there's a lot of tailwind behind inventories, too. Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Great. So related to that last question and Hamid your comments on that progress towards equilibrium inventory. Can you just talk about your recent conversations with customers? What's your sense for how they're balancing this investment need and CapEx spend against concerns about the economic slowdown or recession, and higher overall cost of capital? Yes. I'll pitch it to Mike for more detailed comments on this. So my sense is that customers are -- don't have quite as much FOMO as they did before. In other words, they're not in the hard mentality of let's go get this place because if we don't, somebody else will and all that. I think the market has rationalized with respect to pace of leasing demand and people are being more thoughtful about how they go about their -- taking space because forget about what they pay us in rent. I mean every time you open a new large warehouse, there's a lot of CapEx that goes into it and all that. Real estate is the least of your worries. It's all the other stuff that you have to put in. So I think people are cautious, but they also realize, particularly on the e-com side that this was a theoretical threat before the COVID. Now they see what really happened to their business during COVID. So they're very anxious to build out their full e-commerce supply chain, which is oftentimes a different one than their bricks-and-mortar supply chain. So I would say demand has broadened, it's much less all about Amazon. It's much broader than that. But it's pretty strong. Is it the strongest it's ever been? No, it's not as strong as 2021. But compared to any 10-year period you want to look at, it's -- we would consider this a very strong market. Mike? Yes, I would just to pile on. I mean, on a net basis, the activity is still very strong. Decision time line is definitely have stretched out of people to be more cautious, but remember, these structural configurations we've been talking about for 2 or 3 years continue to march on perhaps at a bit of a slower rate, but ultimately, it comes down to the fear of not having the right space when you needed to hear from now is overwriting, taking space that's a little bit too early. So broadly, we feel pretty good about this overall activity. And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. I just want to follow up on these demand discussions because this is a constant question I get from clients here. And maybe it's more of a Chris question,  but Hamid, feel free to jump in, too. Just in terms of -- in this era of low vacancies were really not in the least, so net absorption is not necessarily the best leading indicator of demand. I mean what are you guys using at least to kind of use as your forward-looking indicator on demand destruction or something that the market could look to because it just seems like retentions are still high, availability is low, construction could fall off, but everyone is talking about inventories big higher, utilization will be higher, so people needing less of the space, but it's just from your commentary, it seems like this is not really filtering through what you guys are seeing? And just some thoughts there. Then related to that, Chris, I mean, what would it take for market rents to actually turn negative? Because that's a question I get a lot as well. And I'm just kind of curious in your modeling kind of what inputs would adopt really turn to get that from the positive 10% you're seeing to somewhere below 0? Okay. Let me start. I am sure Chris can give much more color. I would state this in 40 years ago on this, this is the biggest disconnect that I've seen between the macro economy and the prospects for our business. Usually, those two things are much more aligned. And this time around, they just appear to be completely disconnected for a variety of reasons that we talked about at nauseam. So I think where pricing goes away, vacancy is going to 7% to 8% and staying there. And if you do the math on that, you need another in the U.S., I don't know, 2 billion, 3 billion square feet of unleased construction coming online. And you can't do it overnight, maybe 1 billion something. We can do the math. But it's a big number. And you're not going to keep doing that space that -- if the first 100 million feet doesn't lease, you're not going to do that and by the way, this cycle, you have a couple of big players in the business that have much more to gain from the fundamentals of the business being stronger, rents being stronger than a few bucks they may make on additional development. So there is an economic incentive to be disciplined. In prior cycles, mostly driven by merchant builders and private developers, they don't really care what their rental market was. They just wanted to build the product and sell to somebody else and that will be their problem.  Today, those two sites are connected to one another. So I think that the motivations are really different. And absent the nuclear work type of scenario, I just don't see vacancy rates going to a level that will lead to a reduction in rents. It's either going to be a demand collapse or a supply explosion and I don't see either one of them happening. The other thing I would say is that we are -- we leased 1 million square feet on a daily basis. Just -- let's get our heads around that, 1 million square feet on a daily basis. We throw these big numbers around without really fully appreciating what the scale of that is. I mean that is 10x the amount of space than anybody else in leases in any sector in real estate. So by watching these customers and their behavior, obviously, we'll figure out if some back stuff is about to happen and won't be waiting for the quarterly report to analyze that.  So Chris, do you have specifics? Yes, a couple of specifics. I would lead with our proprietary data leads us to these conclusions. So for example, our sales force pipeline. If we look at the vacancy that we do have, 46% has deals working. That's in line or above the average that we've experienced through COVID to say nothing of the conversations that Mike and Scott and our customer-led solutions team have. In terms of public data, which I think I heard you ask about, Craig, we do publish our IBI survey and our utilization data. And so figures like 60, on our IVI, it's a diffusion index. So that's consistent with this good or great tone that the team has struck and 86% on utilization, which was discussed earlier are ways that you can see that in the marketplace. And then as it relates to what it would take for rents to fall, Hamid described it very specifically. And I'd add one piece of data that I don't see commonly discussed in the marketplace, but it's important to know, which is development starts rather than development completions. Starts in the U.S. We're off by 1/3 in the fourth quarter relative to their 2022 trend. And on the continent in Europe, they were off by 45%. So we're seeing a sharp marking to market at the capital market environment, the valuation environment and what those buildings might be worth for some of those other folks building buildings. By the way, banks are a lot more disciplined because now they have risk-based capital requirements. So putting out a lot of construction loans on buildings that don't lease like used to happen in prior cycles less likely to happen. So I think the market is generally smarter. There's a lot more data. Conversations like we're having today never used to take place 2 decades ago. So the cycles were much more amplified. I think it's pretty hard for that to happen. But something can come out of left field. I'm not discounting that possibility, something really bad to come out of left field and change all this, but I just can't think of what that thing would be. But none of it's predicted the pandemic, I don't think. So things can happen. And our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. I just want to get any color on recent market rent growth and how that may differ between suit size? Like are you seeing any differences in performance between bulk buildings and smaller more infill facilities? I would generally tell you that the smaller spaces are having a tougher time to the extent of anybody having a tougher time, but Chris is looking up the specific. They're not radically different, but why don't we do this? Why don't we go to the next -- you got it? Okay. No, glad to help you out here. First off, market rent growth had great momentum at the end of the year with 5% growth in the U.S., 3% in Europe. When we look at rent change, which is a great way to understand performance in suite size, it's strong across the board. But in fact, late in the year, we saw an improvement in those smaller units, which might be where you're your question is coming from. So it's diverse. Okay. That's different than I would have guessed. And I bet you it's because there was more available space to absorb in those categories. Those categories were less leased. And by the way, we have them, too. I mean we have some smaller than 100,000 square foot unit. So I would say occupancy was a little bit lower, so there was more room to lease product at the higher end. If we flip it to submarkets and we look at, say, infill, which tend to have those smaller units, infill outperformed in the U.S. by 400 basis points last year, so say 34%  in the U.S  in the infill submarkets versus 30% for the whole of the United States. And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Just a quick follow-up from Blaine and myself. So where do you expect to make the most progress on the Essentials business in '23? And how does that factor into your guidance and earnings? And then also if you could just say where you think cap rates are today versus the peak of the cycle? How much they've moved? So two things. I think the Essentials business, in terms of percentage growth, I think our mobility business would be the biggest because it's the smallest right now to start with. So any growth will be the biggest. But in terms of dollar contribution, I would say solar and storage are coming on the strongest today. And operations is to close second behind. I'll pitch it to Gary if he has any more to say about that after this. Second part of the question was -- oh, cap rate. So cap rates are really misleading. So we got to be careful about that. Cap rates at market, assuming that you had a building 1.5 years ago at market and you have a building at market today, I would guess it's 50 to 75 basis points, maybe 100 basis points, okay? It's -- call it, 50 to 100 basis points, but you've had all this rental growth in between. So the observed cap rates for the same building this year versus last year, with rents that are higher by, I don't know, 10%, 15% or something, would not have moved as much.  So -- and if you get into weird situations, like some building that was leased 5 years ago when it comes on the market, and it's -- and the in-place rent is less than half of what market is. That building could have a lower cap rate than it would have had a year ago. IRR is what's really important based on reasonable assumptions and my guess is that if I were going to pick a number, I would say, low to -- low 7, 7.25-ish in the U.S. and maybe a little bit lower than that in Europe with growth of, say, 4-ish percent across a 10-year projection, something like that, approximately. Gary, anything on... I think you have exactly Hamid. In 2023, our mix is going to be about 50% operations and about 50% energy and mobility. The growth rate, obviously, mobility is going to be much higher because it's coming off of basically a 0 base. Where are we investing? We're investing in our energy and mobility businesses. And that's where we're doing the capability because actually see the most significant growth of '25 and beyond. But I mean, just to put a set of stake in this, we are very, very convicted about the potential for these businesses, we're on track to generate our $300 million in revenues and tax benefits by 2025, which we've talked about before. And that is going to deliver about $0.25 per share in FFO. And that would be a little bit above our -- that will be about 100 basis points of growth per year compared to our 2019 Investor Day estimates of about 50 basis points. So net-net, look, we are in great shape. That business is growing right on plan and we're going to continue to make investments in that business. And this year, it's going to be in mobility and energy. By the way, that 2025 number that Gary just mentioned, it's going to be recapturing maybe 15%, 20% of the total opportunity within our portfolio. So there will be a huge runway for growth. And frankly, we're beginning to see more deals out of our own platform because customers are taking us to buildings that they lease from other people to do the same level of service to them in those other situations. So I can't even begin to quantify that out of platform opportunities. So we're really excited about our Essentials business. I think we're at the top of the hour. I know we have 1 more question, but maybe we can take that outside the call, Anthony, with our apologies. But thank you for your interest in the company, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care. Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All participants may disconnect. Have a great day."

         "Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by Roy Harvey, Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer; and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Roy and Bill. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings.  In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website. With that, here's Roy. Thank you, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. As you saw from the fourth quarter and full year results that we released today, we returned $572 million in capital to our stockholders through buybacks and dividend payments in 2022. We continue to be well positioned with a strong balance sheet, ending the year with $1.4 billion in cash and proportional net debt of $1.2 billion.  In 2022, we also progressed strategic restarts of capacity and worked to mitigate the impact of high energy costs. That said, it was a challenging year. World events influenced costs for raw materials and energy. Our markets saw significant variances in pricing between the first half of the year and the second half, demonstrating once again why we are so focused on reducing complexity and continuing our improvement initiatives. As we progress through this year, we will continue to act to drive operational and commercial excellence, disciplined execution and rigorous cost management. Before we get into more details though, I want to emphasize, as always, our most important priority, safety. We strive to protect the safety and health of those who work at our facilities or visit them. In 2022, we did not have any workplace fatalities. This, however, is not an achievement. It is simply an expectation. And we always have areas where we can and will improve. We recognize that maintaining a fatality-free workplace requires constant vigilance to identify and eliminate critical risks. In fact, every employee at Alcoa has the authority and my permission to stop a job and seek help if they are unsure if it's safe to proceed. There's never any production goal that will take priority over safety.  Now on to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, we had a net loss of $374 million and $29 million in adjusted EBITDA. For full year 2022, we had a net loss of $102 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion. It is clear from our fourth quarter results that we are confronting a challenging market and operational situation, and we are taking action to be sure that we are firmly focused on driving improvements across our operations and company.  Bill, who will become our Chief Operating Officer on February 1, will provide the full detail on our financial results in just a moment. Incidentally, this will be Bill's last earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. Molly Beerman, our current Senior Vice President and Controller, is being promoted to CFO. She has tremendous financial experience and has been a strong leader for Alcoa. She'll join me for our earnings calls beginning in April as she takes over Bill's former role and he takes his skill and experience to operations. Now turning to some operational highlights. Last year, we advanced several restarts that will bring economic value to the business. We also acted swiftly to reduce production capacity when and where conditions warranted. Last month, we completed the safe restart at our Portland aluminum joint venture smelter in the state of Victoria in Australia. And we continued to advance the restart of the Alumar smelter in Brazil. To mitigate the rising cost of gas and electricity, we reduced output at the San Ciprián Alumina refinery in Spain and curtailed 1/3 of production at our Lista aluminum smelter in Norway. Separately, over these last couple of weeks, we adjusted production at the smallest of our 3 refineries in Western Australia due to natural gas shortages that continue to persist in the region.  We have a strong foundation across this company with the know-how and expertise to drive continued improvement. We are ready to address short-term challenges while remaining focused on our future, one where aluminum will become even more important as the world works to decarbonize.  As we progress into the year, it's also worth reinforcing the work we are doing on our ESG objectives. Alcoa has a clear purpose and a vision that guides our actions and decision-making. We are producing and delivering products that support our customers' own sustainability ambitions, and we are creating shared value for our communities and our other stakeholders. Just recently, in fact, we were once again named a top-tier industry producer by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. We also continue to pursue growth opportunities via projects that can creep our production. And we're excited about the progressing development of our transformative technologies, which align fully with our vision to reinvent the aluminum industry for a sustainable future. So with that, let's dive into the numbers. Bill, please go ahead. Fourth quarter 2022 revenues declined $188 million compared to the third quarter to $2.7 billion on lower aluminum and alumina prices. At this point in the cycle, input costs were not yet declining and the result for the fourth quarter was a net loss of $374 million or $2.12 per share. Special items in the quarter totaled $251 million and included $196 million of tax items, primarily related to a valuation allowance on Brazilian deferred tax assets, $30 million of smelter restart costs and $26 million from mark-to-market energy contracts.  After special items, adjusted net loss was $123 million or $0.70 per share. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $29 million. For the full year 2022, year-over-year revenues increased $299 million to $12.5 billion, and net income decreased $531 million to a loss of $102 million or $0.57 per share. Adjusted net income changed from $1.3 billion in 2021 to $890 million in 2022 or $4.83 per share, and adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, moved from $2.8 billion to $2.2 billion.  Let's take a closer look at the quarterly change in EBITDA. For fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter, the largest driver of the decline was $98 million of lower metal and alumina prices and includes higher raw material costs and higher production costs in alumina and aluminum. Energy improved $9 million as substantial Lista smelter and San Ciprián refinery improvements were partially offset by CO2 compensation adjustments in Norway of $35 million. Thanks to actions taken at the Lista smelter and the San Ciprián refinery, Lista and San Ciprián EBITDA improved to combined $67 million compared to the prior quarter. The other category is comprised primarily of a $25 million ARO charge in Brazil and $22 million of intersegment eliminations. In the segments, Bauxite improved $9 million on better volume, favorable foreign currency and broad cost improvement. In the Alumina segment, the $42 million EBITDA decline was due to lower index prices as well as a $25 million charge to increase the ARO reserves at Alumar, partially offset by the $27 million improvement from the San Ciprián partial curtailment. In Aluminum, the $121 million EBITDA change was due primarily to lower metal prices but also due to broadly higher costs, partially offset by favorable foreign currency and lower alumina costs. Below the segment level, transformation, intersegment eliminations and other corporate expenses increased a total of $27 million.  Let's move to cash flow. The fourth quarter cash balance declined $69 million sequentially to $1.36 billion as releases of working capital, CO2 credits received and quarterly EBITDA did not fully fund outflows. Capital expenditures, cash income taxes and environmental and ARO spending were the largest uses of cash in the quarter. Dividends paid were $17 million. On a full year 2022 basis, uses outpaced sources by $451 million. Our largest use of cash was returning capital to stockholders, followed by cash income taxes, capital expenditures and increased working capital.  Now for our key metrics at year-end. Return on equity for the full year 2022 was 17.2%. In 2022, we returned $572 million of capital to investors, $500 million of share repurchases and $72 million of quarterly dividends. The balance sheet finished with proportional adjusted net debt of $1.2 billion, while DWC working capital improved $111 million sequentially, primarily due to higher accounts payable. Lower revenues kept days working capital flat at 50 days. Free cash flow less net noncontrolling interest distributions was negative $49 million in the fourth quarter, and the full year 2022 number was positive $177 million.  Let's take a closer look at the cash and liquidity position. We are proud of the improvements we've made to our cash and liquidity position. In the 3 charts you see over time are cash position, debt maturities and key cash outflows. Year-end 2022 cash on the balance sheet was a substantial $1.4 billion, consistent with the average level for the previous 5 year-ends. After redeeming higher rate debt with maturities in 2024 and 2026, our debt has a lower rate and scheduled maturities are inconsequential until 2027. Our revolving credit facility has improved terms, has been extended to 2027 and has no borrowings against it. Pension and OPEB cash needs were low in 2022 and are expected to remain low in 2023 and beyond and are now mostly OPEB, which as you know, is pay as you go.  Turning to our 2023 outlook. First, we are simplifying our reporting structure for 2023. Beginning in January 2023, the company will combine its Bauxite and Alumina segments and report its financial results in 2 segments: Alumina and Aluminum. In future reports, segment information for prior periods will be updated to reflect the new segment structure. In 2023, we expect alumina shipments to range between 12.7 million and 12.9 million metric tons due to lower refinery production, driven by the partial curtailment of the San Ciprián refinery and lower bauxite quality at the Australian refineries.  The Aluminum segment is expected to ship between 2.5 million and 2.6 million metric tons as increased production at Alumar and Portland is offset by lower buy-resell activity and modern shipments. In EBITDA items outside the Alumina and Aluminum segments, we expect transformation costs to increase to $80 million on higher demolition expense and other corporate expense to be virtually unchanged from 2022 at $130 million.  Below EBITDA, we expect depreciation to increase to $645 million primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar. Nonoperating pension and OPEB expense is expected to improve $45 million to $15 million and $110 million interest expense is comparable to 2022's level. For cash flow impacts, we expect 2023 pension and OPEB required cash funding to be similar to 2022 at $75 million. The majority of that spend is U.S. OPEB. Our current capital expenditure estimate is $115 million of return-seeking and $485 million of sustaining capital, and we will continue to review it based on market conditions. We expect $150 million lower prior-period income tax payments in 2023, down to $175 million. Environmental and ARO spending is expected to increase to approximately $195 million. Finally, capital returns to stockholders will be aligned with our capital allocation framework. Looking specifically at adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items for the first quarter and excluding impacts from index sales prices or foreign currency. In Alumina, we expect approximately $25 million higher costs from a Western Australia gas supply disruption to be offset by the nonrecurrence of the Alumar ARO adjustment. In Aluminum, we expect alumina cost to be favorable by $15 million. We also expect Norwegian smelter costs to be favorable by $70 million from the nonrecurrence of CO2 credit adjustments and lower energy costs. Additionally, we expect $15 million lower raw material costs and $15 million lower production costs.  Below EBITDA, other expense is expected to be unfavorable by $45 million sequentially on equity contributions to ELYSIS and lower modern equity income. Based on recent pricing, the company expects 1Q '23 operational tax expense to approximate $5 million to $15 million. Beyond the first quarter of 2023, the company is reducing the available alumina grade at the Huntly mine to provide additional time for an extended mining approvals process. This grade change is isolated to the Huntly mine that supplies the Pinjarra and Kwinana refineries.  Operating the refineries with lower-quality bauxite decreases alumina output and increases input costs. Starting in the second quarter of 2023 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect lower Alumina segment adjusted EBITDA of approximately $55 million per quarter in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2022, after excluding $35 million of nonrecurrence for the Alumar refinery ARO adjustment and certain other nonrecurring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022. Now I'll turn it back to Roy. Thanks, Bill. Next, I'd like to provide some brief commentary about the current global market environment for alumina and aluminum in 2022. Even given the clear change in pricing from first to second half of 2022, these markets were balanced or even in a slight deficit across the year. But differently than we have seen in previous cycles, the cost for raw materials have remained stubbornly high throughout the year, and it is only here in the beginning of 2023 where we are starting to see some minor relief in market pricing.  In fact, we saw some of our highest-ever costs for raw materials in the second half. All direct materials increased in price since the end of 2021, driven by multiple raw material supply disruptions that have kept market balances tight. In Alumina, we saw a 39% increase in the market price for caustic soda in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Caustic soda is used in the digesters in our refineries. In Aluminum, we saw more than a 70% increase for the market price of pitch and a nearly 30% increase for coke compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Both products are used to make anodes for our smelters. Meanwhile, recent smelter curtailments announced across the U.S. and Europe have only marginally influenced calcined coke prices. We have, however, mitigated supply chain disruptions by maintaining an agile and diversified global sourcing portfolio, which also closely manages our inventories to avoid market-driven supply disruptions.  As far as global supply-demand balances, the market for alumina was mostly balanced in 2022. And in aluminum, the global market was in a deficit, including in China and the rest of the world. China has continued to enforce its 45 million metric ton smelting cap, and we saw approximately 2.5 million annualized metric tons of smelting capacity curtailed in the country in 2022 due to power constraints in southern provinces. And we entered 2023 with the likely constructive impacts of a loosened COVID policy in China and the increased application of stimulus measures in China and globally.  Next, let's spend a bit more time on what we're currently seeing in aluminum over a longer time horizon. We continue to see evidence that supports our positive view on aluminum. Although 2022 was an unusual year with global events influencing energy and raw material costs, we remain bullish on the long-term fundamentals for aluminum. Even in a challenging market like what we saw during the second half of last year, there was continued evidence of the growth of aluminum demand for the future.  Let me illustrate this point with 2 of aluminum's end-use markets, transportation and packaging. Since Alcoa became an independent company in 2016, these 2 sectors have experienced significant growth rates. First, the share of electric and hybrid vehicles is on a solid trajectory to experience nearly a sevenfold growth rate in a 6-year period by 2023. These vehicles contain more aluminum in their construction versus traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Electric vehicles, for example, contain approximately 40% more aluminum.  Several recent reports from industry analysts have reported on this strong growth for EVs, which is occurring even faster than some had earlier predicted. And key auto manufacturers such as BMW and Ford have taken significant steps to increase their mix of battery electric vehicles relative to their total output.  At the same time, China, the largest automobile market in the world, saw one of the largest year-over-year increases in 2022 electric vehicle production with 6.9 million units confirmed. Current estimates would add an additional 2.1 million new electric vehicles to be produced in China in 2023, bringing that total to 9 million units on an annual basis. The transition to these vehicles is also supported by several major countries and regions that have announced bans on new internal combustion car sales in the years between 2030 and 2040, including the U.K., France and Canada.  The second market to watch is packaging, which is expected to see a 41% growth rate in aluminum can stock consumption between 2016 and 2023. For Alcoa, packaging was one of our best-performing markets in 2022 in Europe and North America. Also, more beverage products are using aluminum such as alcoholic seltzers and sparkling waters due to the metal's lightweight, infinite recyclability and ability to chill beverages quickly. While these markets are meant to be examples, they support continued strength in aluminum demand in the long term.  Now let's move to the right-hand portion of the slide. Given the importance of Chinese capacity growth over the last decade, one of the most influential factors for this next decade will be China's self-imposed 45 million metric ton cap. We see continued policy decisions and actions in China further supporting this capacity cap. Any increase in that ceiling would hinder the country's well-publicized goals for energy efficiency and decarbonization. While we expect an increase in operating capacity of roughly 1 million tons of metal in 2023 compared to last year, these are added capacities that either transfer existing operating permits from plants that will be shuttered or have outstanding permits complying with the Chinese cap. We've also recently seen China's actions to limit exports of primary aluminum through increased export tariffs on commodity-grade aluminum in 2023, supporting the reality of the country's capacity cap.  One final point to make on this slide. With the drop in global stocks over the last 6 years, inventories in 2023 are expected to remain near historically low levels of 49 days of consumption. The 10-year average has been 77 days and stood at 70 days of global inventories in 2016, the year we launched as a stand-alone company. Relative to annual consumption, the projected stock levels in 2023 could be insufficient if we see a rebound from current demand growth figures in China or the rest of the world. This adds support to both the short- and long-term outlook for aluminum. While there continues to be significant uncertainties about the global economy in 2023, we continue to expect another year that will remain in relative balance for aluminum. And even more importantly, the underlying fundamentals continue to remain very favorable for aluminum in the long term.  Now let's talk specifically about some of the important actions Alcoa completed in 2022 to advance our strategy while also addressing the challenges of a volatile market. First, we worked to offset negative market impacts at some of our locations, including the high cost of energy in Europe, which skyrocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We partially curtailed 2 facilities, adjusting our production rates to San Ciprián alumina refinery in Spain due to high cost of natural gas. And we curtailed 1 of 3 potlines at Lista in Norway, our smallest aluminum smelter due to high electricity costs.  In July of last year, we curtailed 1 potline at Warrick operations due to workforce shortages in the region and increasing instability. And we've continued to maintain that partial curtailment as we focus on safe and consistent production from the site's 2 operating potlines. Also, we are continuing to work toward the planned restart of the San Ciprián smelter. And we've now signed 2 power purchase agreements for wind-based electricity, although permitting will need to be approved by the regional and national Spanish governments before construction can begin.  As I mentioned at the top of our call, we also maintained a strong balance sheet, which is essential, especially at a time when there's still a lot of unpredictability in the world. We reduced our pension liabilities in 2022 by completing a $1 billion transfer of liabilities and related assets to a highly rated insurance company for certain U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. Our strong financial position also enabled us to make dividend payments and share repurchases while achieving an investment-grade rating on our debt and improving our revolving credit facility, which remains untapped.  We made significant strides in growing the business as well at locations on 4 continents through capacity restarts and creep projects. In Australia, we safely completed the restart of additional capacity at Portland Aluminum in the state of Victoria. In Europe, we announced a capital project now underway to increase capacity at Mosjøen in Norway by a creep project. In South America, we progressed with our Alumar restart in Brazil, which is powered 100% by hydropower and will capitalize on the integration with the co-located refinery. In North America, our Deschambault smelter is working to increase its casting capacity to add standard-sized ingots to meet increasing demand for foundry alloys in smaller formats.  With all these actions, we continue to advance sustainably, both in supplying customers with low-carbon products and advancing our breakthrough technologies. In 2022, we continued to see a significant increase in year-over-year demand for our EcoLum low-carbon aluminum, which is part of our Sustana brand. Sustana is the most extensive suite of low-carbon products in the aluminum industry. While still a relatively small portion of our overall sales volume, we saw increased margins and deliveries of EcoLum in 2022. Our sales of EcoLum, in fact, grew more than 4x over 2021, driven mostly by the European market.  Two examples of customers looking to us for this low carbon metal were Speira, a global aluminum rolling and recycling company; and Hellenic Cables, a large cable producer in Europe with key markets in renewable energy transmission and distribution. We also maintained an increased certifications with the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative, our industry's most comprehensive third-party validation of responsible production. We have 2 additional sites certified to ASI standards in 2022, bringing our total number of sites to 17. We can also market and sell ASI-certified bauxite, alumina and aluminum to customers globally.  Finally, we made progress on our road map of breakthrough technologies. This includes work to decarbonize the alumina refining process through our Refinery of the Future initiative, which has support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Also, our ELYSIS joint venture furthered its work to commercialize the carbon-free smelting process first developed at Alcoa's Technical Center.  The actions we took in 2022 helped us prepare for the year ahead. As we start this new year, we are laser-focused on further improvement. We will drive operational excellence and rigorous cost management to meet today's challenges while working to promote future growth. We are developing opportunities to create growth via improved margins as a producer of low-carbon products, and our breakthrough technologies provide opportunities that can set us apart from others in the industry.  The news that we announced last week regarding our restructured executive leadership team will drive continued focus on our priorities. We have teams across Alcoa that have a proven ability to execute and we intend to deliver. In operations, we are actively managing the issues we face in Western Australia as it relates to ore supply, as Bill mentioned in his portion of the presentation. While the annual mine approvals are taking longer than in prior iterations, we are adjusting our Huntly mine plan to extend mining operations already permitted under our existing approvals. We continue to work collaboratively with regulators to address this matter.  Meanwhile, we are focused on improving our overall system processes to drive stability and performance across our facilities. We continue to review our operating capacity to address short-term market challenges and promote operational excellence. This includes monitoring the energy situation that prompted our decision to curtail some production at our Lista smelter and the San Ciprián refinery and the most recent impacts from gas shortages that led to a 30% reduction in output at the Kwinana refinery in Western Australia. And we continue to progress the restart of the Alumar smelter and prepare for the future restart of the San Ciprián smelter per our agreement with the workers there.  We've worked hard over these past several years to improve our company's financial position, and we are intent on maintaining that rigor as we further sharpen our focus on costs. We will continue our work to maintain a strong balance sheet, which includes considering more opportunities to reduce the risks from pension liabilities as the market allows. While we focus on the immediate needs for success for 2023, we are also keeping our future programs firmly in focus. Our R&D programs are fundamental for our long-term growth strategy and our vision to reinvent the aluminum industry.  Our breakthrough technologies include the ELYSIS joint venture, our Australia scrap purification process and the Refinery of the Future initiative. Our strategy and technology road map are tightly linked and continued innovation will be vital. Today, we offer the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of low-carbon products, and we are focused on delivering to our customers products that can help them and us reach sustainability goals.  We've seen year-over-year growth in both margins and volumes for our Sustana line, and we intend to continue this growth. And we see this developing low-carbon market as the key to building this critical demand as our ELYSIS joint venture continues to progress towards production at industrial scale. Due to work across our company, we are well positioned as a supplier of choice, especially in a world that is working to further reduce greenhouse gases. We have a global refining system with the industry's lowest carbon dioxide intensity, and a significant portion of our smelting portfolio is powered by renewable energy.  Underpinning all of our initiatives, we remain committed to being a responsible and reliable producer, working cooperatively with our communities to bring shared value. We also have clear mid- and long-term sustainability goals, and we will continue to make progress against those targets.  Finally, I have just a few points I'd like to summarize before we take questions. First, our industry was a case study in contrast in 2022.  The first half of the year was very strong with high pricing that more than offset high raw material costs. But world events negatively influenced our markets in the back half of the year. That helped emphasize once again why we operate with an intense focus on cost and delivering consistent operational excellence while we continue to work on projects that can drive future growth.  Next, we know the world has experienced unexpected and disruptive volatility. Still, producers everywhere are facing increased demands and assurances of responsible production. Alcoa is quick to adapt and we will not simply wait for a market recovery. Alcoans know how to do the hard work, including managing both the short- and long-term opportunities ahead.  And finally, we took action in 2022, and we will continue to improve and operate as a sustainable low-cost producer while we work on our vision to reinvent the aluminum industry. The world is working to decarbonize and that provides us an opportunity. We know the long-term fundamentals for our industry are strong. Aluminum is the material of choice, and Alcoa is the company to deliver the products our customers are demanding. With that, we're ready to take your questions. Operator, who do we have on the line? [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Congratulations on the new role, Bill. Thanks, Emily. My first question is around Western Australia alumina. And perhaps, could you share specifically what's driving the delays to the mine plan approvals there? Are these new environmental requirements that have been recently enforced that you now have to address? And is there a time frame in mind as to when you would expect to see those approvals received? Yes. Emily, I appreciate the question. So we have an annual planning cycle. And as you can imagine, it takes time for us to adapt and prepare and put together everything that goes into choosing where we mine and how we mine. And so we also have an annual regulatory and set of connections that we make in order to receive all the permits that we need for operations. And so as expectations have been increasing around how we protect the environment, the amount of information and baseline data that we provide over to regulators has started to increase. And this is particularly in relationship to the Myara area that we're mining today. It just takes longer for us to be able to receive and then put into place those permits. And so essentially, it's not necessarily new requirements but a new set of discussions that are necessary and just more discussions that are happening between us and the regulators. And so as we go through that process and because of the critical importance of bauxite that we have coming into the refineries and also just because of how critical Western Australia is to Alcoa as a company, we thought it would make sense from a risk mitigation standpoint really just to step back, give ourselves a little bit of extra time, particularly for the process in play for the coming years and really work through these permits and make sure that we were delivering to our regulators all they needed in order to be able to secure those permits.  So I have confidence that we're going to get to an end point here. I look at this as an intelligent way to make sure that we have the extra time that's demanded because of -- just because of some of the changing expectations and some of these discussions to allow them to fully happen. Over the course of these next few years, we're in the midst of preparing for that next big mine move in the Huntly mine to North Myara. That is a larger set of discussions and it's what we call a Part IV environmental approval, which is sort of a full bone review of how we'll access those reserves and connections with communities, et cetera.  And so really, this just helps to set us up over the course of these next few critical quarters to be able to manage all those different processes. Again, I have full confidence that we're going to get this where it needs to be. I find that we're collaborating and working with all of the stakeholders that are involved in the process. I just felt it was the right thing to do to really derisk and make sure that we have what we need and that we can operate our refineries smartly.  I would add 1 more thing on top of that, Emily, because I think it's important. As we look at these next few quarters over the course of 2023, the opportunity we have is also to fine-tune our refineries to make sure that they're managing the -- managing these new bauxite grades really smartly. And so I think there are opportunities that we have to learn how to run more efficiently, to manage the mud and sand loans that are coming in and really to make sure that we're optimizing and running as cost efficiently as we possibly can in Western Australia and across the portfolio.  And that points to some of the changes that we've been making in the organization as well really just to make sure that we are as cost effective as we possibly can be. And so I -- again, I'm confident we'll get the permits. I'm also confident that we can find ways to improve and make sure that we're driving that -- those mine operations and refinery operations as smartly as we possibly can. Great. That was really helpful, Roy. Maybe a follow-up, if I may, and sticking with the cost theme there, but just wanted to touch on what you're seeing from the lower gas prices in Europe right now. And if there's been any benefit to San Ciprián going forward for the Alumina segment. I don't think that was mentioned in the release. So yes, we are seeing lower gas prices in Europe for San Ciprián refinery. San Ciprián refinery results improved fourth quarter over third quarter. We anticipate that they will improve again first quarter over fourth quarter due to a couple of actions: one, the lower gas prices; two, some of the commercial actions that we've taken to try to drive some price increases in our NMA business and really trying to optimize the cost of running the refinery at the lower levels that we have at that. The next question is from Alex Hacking with Citi. Let me add my congrats to Bill on the new role. Deserve a lot of credit, especially if you work on the balance sheet. And hopefully, investors will still have a chance to hear from you going forward. Just following up on Emily's question on the cadence of cost. You mentioned that at San Ciprián, you would expect sequentially lower cost in the first quarter. As we look further ahead into the second quarter, would we expect European smelter costs, Norway, San Ciprián to keep falling, assuming that nat gas is at current levels or keep or falls further? Alex, what we're seeing on the cost structure is really we're now starting finally to see some reduction in key raw material costs. I think you probably saw in the chart that we're starting to see coke prices tip over. Pitch is continuing to be pretty high. But we've guided to a relatively stronger result in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, especially in the Aluminum segment. So in Aluminum, we're guiding really to $100 million positive, $100 million up from the fourth quarter in the first quarter. As we look out into the second quarter, it really will depend on what energy prices do. And with the volatility in the market, it's probably too early to give an indication of what energy prices will do in the second quarter of the year. Okay. And then on the San Ciprián smelter, what percentage of power is covered by the 2 PPAs that you signed? And then what are prices they're indexed to, if anything? Are they sort of indexed to market prices or LME? Any color there would be helpful. Yes. Alex, I can answer that one. So the -- these 2 contracts that we've put together over the course of 2022 really add up to about 75% of the total demand for the smelter operating at full capacity. We've not talked about how the pricing structure works, but essentially, it's a fixed price. And then you need to add in transmission charges in any programs that the Spanish government might be running an order on interruptibility and things like that. We look at this as an opportunity to really re-baseline and prepare San Ciprián for our future. It's the reason we put together the agreement with the workforce. We were able to gain the time where we didn't -- where we were able to curtail the facility completely and are preparing, as I said in my comments before, preparing for the restart back in January -- the start of the restart back in January 2024. The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Happy new year Roy and Bill. And Bill, congrats on your tenure as CFO and all the best in the new role. Just a question regarding the Kwinana run rate, just to continue the discussion on alumina, I guess. You mentioned in the press release, and I think there were some news articles that the gas supply has improved, but yet you're keeping the reduced capacity utilization there. So what would need to change for you to take the capacity utilization higher in that refinery? That will be my first question. And then the second one maybe related to ELYSIS. What can you tell us there in terms of important milestones? When should we hear an update from you on how the developments are progressing? And when will you be making the decision of further investments? I think there was something around $100 million contingent CapEx depending on the success of the developments that you're running right now. Carlos, let me give you first couple of answers, then Bill can fill in, particularly on the ELYSIS numbers. Kwinana, just to get started there, so we've got about 30% curtailed. It was very much driven by the fact we just didn't have enough gas in the state of Western Australia, asked large consumers of gas to look for ways to be able to reduce. And operating on diesel just doesn't make a lot of sense just because of the price differential and for a number of other reasons.  So as we looked at that, the right thing to do was to be able to take a series of maintenance activities and bring that down by 30%. At this point, we have seen improvements in how much gas is available essentially up to our normal contracts. We've seen an improvement but we've not yet got back to the stability that we normally have. I would say we've made good progress in being able to fill in some of the gaps so that we're now running what we have running fully on natural gas, and we're not substituting diesel, which is very good and good from a cost standpoint but also good from a stability standpoint.  But we need to see continued sort of the return of all the normal operating capacity back before we start making that next set of decisions about whether we bring it back up or not. All intentions or sort of what we had seen before is that by the end of January, we should see some of those maintenance and downtime events in our suppliers start to ease up, the ones that haven't done so already. And so we'll be analyzing as we go. And as always, we'll keep you informed and let you know as soon as we've made a decision on that, Carlos. On ELYSIS, just jumping into that second question as well, important milestones. I'll hit it qualitatively, and then Bill can step in and talk a bit more about the numbers. For me, the next important milestones, the ones that obviously, we'd be talking more about, we're in the midst of constructing and preparing to start up the first industrial-scale cells. And so that will be happening over the course of 2023. So as you can imagine, this year is very important to see those cells starting to operate and to start to see those initial results.  And I would imagine that we'll keep the market informed as much as we feel is appropriate over the course of 2023 and 2024 as those cells continue to operate. By the end of 2024, what we've said is that we want a commercial package available so that we can get started on the first installations of ELYSIS, which we've not defined where that will happen yet, with the idea that the first operating capacity really will be happening in 2026.  And so to me, 2023 is going to be absolutely critical because it's going to show that we're -- that we've got the ability to operate, to generate the quality of metal at P1020 or better capacity and to start to work on making sure that we can deliver on the operating efficiencies and the capital efficiencies that we've got planned. So it's going to be an exciting year. And on the numbers, Carlos, a couple of numbers to keep in mind. We guided in the -- we are guiding in the first quarter that other income will be down sequentially by about $45 million. $35 million of that $45 million is associated with contributions to ELYSIS in the first quarter. So you know the way the accounting for the ELYSIS contributions are is that when we make that contribution, we immediately take the hit in income and that sits in other income. For a full year estimate, including the $35 million of contributions in the first quarter, we would anticipate about $60 million in full year contributions for ELYSIS at this point. Now that will flex based on timing of some of the key decisions, but that's our best estimate at this point. All right. Very exciting indeed. Good luck, guys. The next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. I wanted to just touch on a little piggybacking on the discussion of kind of what it takes to restart some of your idle capacity but ask a little differently. Looking around the European markets, do you think that there's also the potential for some extensive restarts, given lower gas prices? Or what do you think it takes to see some of those facilities also restart? Timna, I can -- I'd take a first thing at that 1 and Bill can chime in as well if he wants to. The -- operating in Europe is still pretty difficult. So you compare it to prior to the war in Ukraine or maybe even better, take it a year before that because we were seeing an inflation in energy prices even the year before. It's still a very difficult place in order to operate a smelter or a refinery. And so those smelters that are operating tend to be ones that have long-term contracts that have been disconnected from the spot prices that we see today. We were able to find a solution on the relatively small -- lease the smelter that we have, although it is 1/3 curtailed at this point, and that was through some incredible work that our strategy and commercial teams were able to do. But it's still just not a market where you can justify continuing to operate at spot power rates as you see.  And I would extend that over to the Refining business as well when you're buying spot gas. The current LME pricing for aluminum nor the API pricing for alumina giving you a return given where those rates are. As we see the winter continue and if it continues as mild as it is, I think perhaps you'll start to see some opportunities that emerge but we're just not seeing that yet.  If anything, when I look across Europe, I'd say that there are still opportunities or potential and particularly where certain smelters might be coming up on end of shorter-term contracts and then are going into the spot market or looking for that next series of contracts. I think there's still some curtailment potential that could happen both on the smelting side. And we've also heard some rumors about stuff that could be happening also on the refining side that sort of informed the difficulty that's happening in the market.  Again, we always -- when we step back and we look at our facilities and we think about how we run them, San Ciprián is a good example. The San Ciprián refinery is a good example of a place where we've been able to make smart decisions and curtail it partially so that we're really only producing the tons that, in fact, are creating value for us. It doesn't necessarily fix the problems because we want to be operating that facility at full speed again down the road, but we need to see the more relief on gas before we get to that particular point or more relief coming in from the pricing, the API pricing, et cetera. Just to put some numbers around that, Roy, I was going to reiterate the point that you are making at the end there. We were -- we have been consistently surprised that more capacity hasn't come off-line in Europe. And you've heard us, Timna, talk many times about 1 million to 1.2 million metric tons that was at risk because of high cost in Europe. We would still say that today, in the month of December, we think that 15% to 25% of the European smelting capacity is cash negative.  So as we look around the world, the majority of the cash negative smelting capacity is sitting in Europe today. To add on, on the refining side, a surprising number is that we would consider close to 85% of the refining capacity in Europe to be cash negative at the December average gas prices. Now we know that gas prices have changed a little bit in January, but a lot of the capacity in Europe on the refining side is cash negative. Okay, that's super helpful. My other second question was just on the CapEx, given that your guidance, at least from my recollection, is a little lower than what we've seen before by $50 million. And actually, your 2022 came in, I think, about $45 million lower than what you had initially said. So just wondering if any shortfalls there, if that is getting pushed out, any explanation would be great. I wouldn't say anything that were necessarily getting pushed out, Timna. Given -- and you've seen over the years, given the market situation that we are in and the cash generation of the company, we will flex the capital spending up and down. And so I think it's a good point. The last time we gave you guidance around 2023 was back in November of 2021. And we said at the time, we would spend $550 million of sustaining capital. And that was before we curtailed the smelter in Spain and made some commitments in Spain on capital spend there. So the $485 million that we're showing you for 2023, we've already ratcheted down a little bit based on current market conditions.  With that said, going into my new role, we will make sure that we spend that $485 million wisely and do the best that we can to  make sure that we maintain the assets at the right level so that we can produce the tons in the good times. The next question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. And Bill, I hope it wasn't our questions that led you to the new role. In terms of my question, I wanted to follow up on Huntly. Is the easiest way to think about it, it's about $165 million impact for 2023 between [indiscernible] and then as we look out to 2024, this issue will hopefully be resolved? Yes. The number you put out there, the $165 million is correct. That is in relation to the fourth quarter and you just need to -- we needed to be able to ground you in how much this issue was going to cost us in Q2 through Q4. So it's $55 million unfavorable compared to the fourth quarter. But it's important that you first back out some of the unfavorable items that occurred in the fourth quarter in the Alumina segment. So in the Alumina segment in the fourth quarter of 2022, we had an ARO charge of $25 million, and we had an incremental onetime set of charges that were some small things in that segment. So what we're guiding you to is start with the fourth quarter of Alumina, add back the $35 million and then deduct the $55 million. So it's an incremental $20 million of unfavorability in relation to the fourth quarter. And I hope that's clear. We just needed to try to make that as clear as we possibly could for you to be able to model out the impact. Very clear to me. I appreciate that detail. And this would also include all the quality concerns that Roy mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions? It does. That's an inclusive number that includes the loss of tons, but also it's more expensive to make the tons that we will be making. As we push through lower-quality bauxite through the refineries, we will have higher usages of caustic and other input costs. So that's inclusive of those 2 items, tons and costs. Very helpful. I appreciate that. And then switching quickly to San Ciprián. Could you run us through a punch list for that restart? I know you spent some time on that theme today but would appreciate what is necessary there. And if this punch list is not completed by the end of this year, what happens? Do you go ahead with whatever the spot price for power is at that time or are there other remediation possibilities? Yes, Lucas, let me try and answer that, and then if I'm not hitting the targets, let me know. So what we have are a series of commitments that we made that essentially allowed us to idle the facility a little bit more than a year ago. There were a certain number of capital investments, and some of those take longer than others, as you can imagine, and they're meant to set up the facility for the long term. And so those are ongoing. And also, what we need to do is make sure that it's ready to restart when we get to January 1, 2024, which was a very specific commitment that's inside of the agreement. Our workforce is there ready and waiting. And in fact, we've been trying to help with certain trainings and things like that. But in the end, there's only a certain number of activities that they can do. They've helped with some maintenance and things like that, but they're ready and waiting and ready to jump in to start that restart.  So really, we just need to make sure that we have all of the raw materials necessary so as 2023 progresses, we'll be able to make sure that we've got the coke and pitch or anodes in place so that when we start to spark those pots and bring production back online again, it will be ready to go.  From an energy perspective, it's a matter of, we've got the 75% worth of contracts that are already in place. Those are wind farms still to be constructed. So those are going through the permitting phases, which connects with both the national and regional governments. There will then be a construction phase. As you can imagine, the construction of wind farms in northwestern Spain is something that's happened often in the past, but it takes some time to be able to bring those up to speed.  And so we will need to find a solution for the piece of the -- for the remaining 25% plus the piece of the 75% that will not be ready when we get ready to restart those pots. And whether we run that on spot, whether we find a shorter-term contract, how we manage that is still not something that we've disclosed or have made a decision on. But as you can imagine, because we have that agreement with the workforce, we will be ready when the time comes and we'll be working on that over the course of these next months. Right. That is very helpful. That's exactly what I was looking for, so I appreciate that, and to you and the team, continued best of luck. The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Good evening, everyone, and well done, Bill. Thanks, Michael. Roy, could you share with us your observations of what your major customers are behaving like right now as we went through to 2023? Is there expectation that the recovery from the pandemic restrictions in China and such and stimulus is going to be a pretty major factor? Is it going to be sooner rather than later, given what your customers are thinking? Yes. I can provide some color, Mike. As always, every customer might be a little bit different so I'll try and generalize a little bit. We're still seeing a lot of strength in the U.S. market, particularly. And so when we look across the different product categories, and I would highlight transportation and packaging is the 2 places where we're just seeing -- we continue to see more demand than probably we're able to fulfill. So the U.S. market is still running very well. In Europe, I think there's a lot more uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty, I think, has started to step back a little bit just because of the reduction in gas prices and the reduction in electricity prices that we're seeing. There has been a certain amount of destocking, so I think that our customers have been taking the position that they are, being very careful what they order. And in Europe, we tend to contract on a quarterly basis. And so you tend to see those reactions happen a bit quicker than what you might see in the U.S. But I think there's now, I would argue, more uncertainty in the market about whether we'll start to see a better recovery. And you've probably seen as well as I have some of the analyst coverage about the potential for recovery in Europe because it's been such a mild winter and because they are -- they have sufficient gas and storage.  And so I'd say there's been a cautious approach in Europe, but I think it's also potentially constructive as we see what happens over these next few critical weeks and these next few critical months. From a Chinese perspective, and we don't sell particularly into China but I think that has a knock-on impact what people are seeing there, I think there's a general expectation that they need to work through this abrupt opening of -- or loosening of COVID restrictions. I know there's plenty of discussions about how much industrial activity is able to happen between now and the Chinese New Year. We've also seen a lot of issues on the supply side, particularly when it comes to aluminum, just because of the availability of energy between droughts and hot weather and all sorts of things, it hasn't been an easy time to see stable operations in China, particularly in smelting these days.  And all that sort of will culminate then coming out of the Chinese New Year. We're coming into it, and I just saw a headline today saying that we're relatively a very low inventory build coming into Chinese New Year, which then bodes very well if we see that demand recover and we start to come out of sort of what might be the spike in cases of COVID because of the loosening of COVID restrictions. It really does bode well for demand coming out of China and because of the size of the Chinese market, that then bodes well for all of the global markets when it comes to aluminum. So certainly, a lot of the things I've been seeing recently are providing a lot of breadcrumbs that say, \"Hey, there's still a significant amount of uncertainty.\" We come out of what's been a relatively small deficit for the aluminum market in 2022 into a market where there's a lot of uncertainty, but I would argue that over these last weeks, we've been seeing more and more positivity come out. Again, that's -- you always take into account what could happen in Ukraine, what's happening across the world when it comes to demand, et cetera.  But I look at our business and I look at our customers, and we're still finding good uptake of our value-added products. We continue to see good improvements on our low-carbon offerings as well. And that's a piece of the market. It's particularly developed inside of Europe. But to me, that sort of gives you good positive signs that we're continuing to see a constructive market. And that even if there are short-term disturbances when we look into the medium and long terms, I am very positive about what's going to happen across our markets. Our final question comes from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research. Looking at ELYSIS and the Refinery of the Future, what is the likely first location where you would retrofit a smelter or retrofit a refinery? And what year might we look ahead to that? Is it possible for 2025 or sooner or later? So it's a great question, John, and not one that we've yet defined and certainly not communicated. And so we're looking across all the jurisdictions where we operate. As you can imagine, there's a lot of excitement about ELYSIS and a lot of excitement about who can be first. Canada, of course, is one of the frontrunners because they've been so supportive of the technology, the technology as an investor, as supporting all of the work that's being done in Canada right now. And obviously, they have a very attractive energy scheme as well. But I wouldn't count out the U.S. as a potential location. Norway is another great place where we've had a lot of support from the government in a lot of different places. And so I'd say that it is still very much open where that first application will happen. And to be quite honest, as we watch the good results come in here over the course of 2023, it's going to get more and more of an opportunity for us to decide where will that first application be.  And as to when that first 1 will be built, what we've been saying is that by the end of 2024, we want the engineering package in place so that first metal can come out in 2026. So it says we really need to get started building in -- across '24 and '25. So it doesn't give us a lot of time. It means we're coming up on a decision where that first location will be. It means we need to be interfacing with all of our host governments and our potential host governments and need to continue to see good progress on the actual success of those industrial-scale cells that are being operated today. As far as Refinery of the Future, yes? Yes. As far as Refinery of the Future, John, and I'll address that 1 quickly, remember that Refinery of the Future is really a suite of processes that we are developing. Out of that suite of processes, there are some that we've talked about externally, for instance, mechanical vapor recompression and electric calcination. We have committed to do a pilot of mechanical vapor recompression in 2023 at the Wagerup facility, and we're getting some funding from the Australian government.  Out of the $115 million that we're talking about return-seeking capital, MVR is included in that $115 million. So while we've skinnied down our return-seeking and our sustaining capital, there are a handful of projects that are really critically important for us and MVR is one of them, and that's included in those numbers. As far as electric calcination, it's a little bit farther away, and we need to prove out the technology at a smaller scale. So it's too early to say where that would be applied. If I could follow up on Slide 17, Roy's key areas of focus for 2023. A couple of the targets look like they're kind of hard things to do. On bauxite quality, are you assuming that you get regulatory approval? Or would you go across the road and buy some bauxite from Worsley or across the lake from Weber or something? And with gas supply in Western Australia and energy for San Ciprián and Lista, are you essentially seeing the markets soften and that supplies are going to become available that were not available several months ago? So John, it's all very important questions. So first and foremost, and this is something I've learned over the time I've been CEO of Alcoa, we lack easy-to-solve problems. We have lots of things that need complicated solutions, that take time and smart ways in order to address them. It's why I've got the team that I do. It's why I've got a lot of faith as we deal with these things. And to be quite honest, it's one of the reasons that we made some of the changes in the executive team to make sure that we're focused on the right things to be quite honest. And so we have the bandwidth, we have the right people working on these things. And to be quite honest, particularly on the strategy side, we try and look at things without boundary conditions so that we can find what's best to solve for the long-term viability for this business and for our stockholders across the board as well as our stakeholders as well.  And so when it comes to bauxite, like I said in one of the prior answers, I have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to work collaboratively and get to a conclusion, a timely conclusion so that we can we can operate these facilities for another few decades. I just -- I have full confidence because everything is lined up. We have the right people working on it, and I think we have the support of our host government. But that doesn't mean that we can't look at other ways in order to bring in bauxite or to look at other solutions. And so we'll continue to do that. When it comes to your point about solving the energy questions around a plant like Lista or San Ciprián in the short term before we get to these new contracts for the San Ciprián refinery, a lot of times, the deals happen as you get towards deadlines and as you build up consensus with communities and with host governments to find shared and common interest. And a lot of times, it can mean that you're working with suppliers, your energy suppliers so that you can provide that baseload. That's worked really well in the energy contracts that we've built up with Greenalia and Endesa for San Ciprián in the future. We're sort of that baseload customer, and we can get a very advantageous cost position, price position for us. But we also have to see how the market develops and then look at what -- how the market mechanisms can then come to support those final contracts. So all that to say, they are difficult problems and there's a lot -- it's a pretty simple slide, but there's a lot of work that's going into it. But I think we have the right people working on the right things.  And I would just come back to my point that we put a lot of creativity in how to solve these things because none of them are easy problems. And the fact is, is that we need to always step back and say, are we doing things as -- with as little complexity and with as much effectiveness as we possibly can? It's a really good question, John, and I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you for your efforts as a management team. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Roy Harvey for closing remarks. Thank you, operator, and thanks, once again, to everybody who joined this call. Given his time as CFO of Alcoa Inc. and now Alcoa Corp., I thought it would be good to hear a few words from our good friend, Bill, before we close for today. Bill? Thanks, Roy. I'll just make a couple of points before we close off. The first point is I'm absolutely thrilled that Molly Beerman is stepping in as CFO. When I look at Molly's abilities, she has tremendous knowledge of our company. She knows the financials better than anybody out there, and she's a great leader. And on top of that, I think she will be a steady hand to help be a business partner for you, Roy. And I am just really happy that she's stepping into the role. So thrilled about that.  I guess, secondly, to address Lucas' question, Lucas, this is my 40th earnings call as the CFO of Inc. and Corp., a full 10 years. And I have enjoyed tremendously the interaction with investors, investors, buy side, sell side. One of the highlights of my career has been working with the people on this call. And many of the most enjoyable times that I've had as CFO have been working with the people on this call. So going on to a new role, I think over time, we may run into each other again. So it's probably not goodbye for now but maybe just we'll see you in the future. So Roy, thanks for the opportunity to address the group. Yes. Thanks, Bill. And as you know, he's not going that far away. Operations are critically important to us. He does sit next to me in our Pittsburgh office, and we're moving him out and moving Molly in. So the value of my real estate is definitely going up because of better neighbors.  But in the end, not to belabor the point, in the end, I think we've got the right people doing the right thing. Molly is going to do a great job as CFO. Bill is going to do a great job as COO. And we have complex issues but we've got the right team that are working on them. So I just want to, once again, reiterate that I appreciate everybody's continued interest in the company.  I really do believe that we've built, over these 6 years, a strong foundation. And I also believe that we're working on the right things, that we're driving -- continuing to drive improvement and making sure that we're doing things in the right way. So these next few months will be gone before we know it, so I look forward to speaking with you again in April for our first quarter 2023 results. And we're going to have Molly Beerman at my side answering questions and helping us walk through the earnings. So thank you to everybody. Have a good night. Stay very safe, and we'll talk to you soon. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q4 2022 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR and Corporate Development.  Joining me today are Executive Chairman, Reed Hastings; Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters; and CFO, Spence Neumann. Our interviewer this quarter is Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America.  As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary.  With that, Jessica, over to you for your first question. Thank you, and thank you so much for having me today. So Reed, the big announcement about the management changes. Could you give us some more color on the process and how you came to this decision? Jessica, it feels like yesterday was our IPO. We were covered in red envelopes. We IPO-ed at about $1. Hopefully, some of you have held the stock, the full 21 years. And when I think of the evolution, the three of us and so many other incredible Netflix employees to go from DVD service to streaming leader in films and television and emerging player in games. And now to have over 230 million members, it's just -- well, Jim Collins probably said it best. He calls it a good start. We've had a good start.  But honestly, we dream of the whole world finding their favorite entertainment Netflix, and we shorthand that as entertaining the world. And the three of us have been working together for 15 years now trying to figure out how do we get through this issue, that issue, how do we grow. And I couldn't be happier to complete our succession process.  It really started about 10 years ago with the Board trying to think through how could this work. They both have such amazing talents and gifts, and to find a platform where they've been able to contribute is fantastic. About 2.5 years ago, we took a partial step. Ted as Co-CEO, Greg as COO. We continue to just make super progress. And frankly, more and more, they've been leading the company, and this is acknowledging really in formal terms how we've been operating for at least the last few quarters. It's just a great feeling.  And when I think about the stock appreciation over the last decade, I know that they want to beat that record, and I'm all for that. I'll be Executive Chairman, helping them everywhere I can, but it's really theirs to lead and to do that energy and hustle and intensity that we've been doing. They're very ready. That's what's driving the timing, and so I could not be happier. So back over to you. Thank you. Subjectively, I'll just add that this may be the smoothest transition we've seen in media for quite a while. Now for Ted and Greg, what does this mean for Netflix? Does this signal a change in strategy or approach? Jessica, let me start with, first and foremost, to thank Reed personally and professionally. He has been, and I trust will, continue to be a role model, a mentor, a friend. And 22-plus years, he has positively changed my life in every way imaginable, and he leaves some big shoes for Greg and I to fill. Unfortunately, we have four feet to do it with. So that's a good thing.  In so many ways, the way that Reed has been able to see around corners. That's why he's been thinking about the succession for the last decade. He generously opened up more of a co-leadership model over a decade ago for he and I -- and like you said, 2.5 years ago made it a little more formal. And in that time, delegating a lot of the day-to-day to Greg and I. And in that time, in the 2.5 years we've been working at it. We've been working together for 15 years, Greg and I. But in the last 2.5 years, particularly, we've been able to build a really trusting, respectful and complementary partnership. In many ways, the same way I would read over the years. And I really do believe that this kind of shared leadership model is going to help us to move fast to challenge each other, to challenge the company to raise to new heights. And I'm just incredible what we're able to do.  And to your point, this is the leadership team. It's been pretty stable, and that's why that steady transition feels so steady. The ability of this team has helped us build a great foundation and a culture that can absorb complexity and change. And as you saw in this last quarter, it can rise to any occasion. And Greg, I just want to say I'm thrilled to be in this with you. And Reed, we can't thank you enough. Thanks, Ted. It's a real honor to be asked to take on this responsibility and join you as co-CEO and frankly a pleasure to be able to compete to working with some of the most amazing leaders that I've ever had the pleasure of working with and frankly, in my opinion, the best leaders the Netflix has ever had.  So I'll just echo Ted's comments. It's been a real fun and rewarding experience to work closely with him over the last couple of years especially, and I'm tremendously proud of the partnership that we've developed in the shorthand and really how we have been able to take what are sort of a complementary set of skills and perspectives and seeing different angles to different situations.  But basically, at the end of the day, we are, I've always found, are ultimately motivated by the same thing, which is that we want to serve our members. And we want to grow our business, and that is an incredible powerful lining process to those different perspectives. So I'm proud of the work that we've done over '22 in the latter half, especially to get some more momentum into the business, but I'm even more excited about continuing to push that into '23 and follow the model that Reed has always had of continually seeking excellence and always striving to be better. So looking forward to that.  And then to your specific question, Jessica, we -- there's no big strategy shift or big culture shifts Ted, Reed and I have been working and sort of grinding through our individual on this for a long time. And so really, we look forward to taking things forward as we have been for the last little bit in responding to a dynamic industry and doing the changes that we think are appropriate. But we're not -- we don't have a bank of changes that were -- that we've been holding for this moment. So mostly, it's continuity and move forward. Great. So this was originally for Reed. But now given the change in leadership structure, maybe for all three of you, for Reed, Ted and Greg. One of the best quotes recently was from John Malone, who said shareholders should build a monument for Reed hastings.  John Rupert Murdoch ran the dominant global media companies in prior decades, and we're one of the few media executives who've been able to see around corners. Ultimately, they both sold the bulk of their assets. Netflix is now one of the most dominant global media companies, if not the dominant. What is your view of the next 5-plus years? Do you need to get bigger? Stay the course? Well, the one thing I'd point out is that what's happening now and what's going to be happening over the next couple of years is that the consumer is moving to streaming. So the way that they watch content at home delivered to them on Internet on demand, free of the linear schedule and all those things, that is a change, a fundamental shift in the business, and you've got to be where the consumer is. And that's what we've been focused on since we started streaming, doing original content 10 years ago, but being really realizing that we really have benefited from being a customer-first company and meeting the customers where they are.  And we've also had the blessing of that having to unwind our traditional media business as we built into this one. So we've always been focused on the future and where the consumers are going. And I think our ability to continue to stay focused on that because we're -- this is really -- I know we've been talking about it for a long time, Jessica, but this is really in its infancy. I mean you think about as big as we've become and all these things that are happening. And in the U.S., we're about 8% of TV time still. So it's an enormous amount of growth ahead, even in markets where we are very well-established. So that's the key for us, and I think being able to focus on consumers first. And it has really been our biggest benefit, and I think it's what led us to those milestones that you just referred to. Greg? Yes. And Jessica, I would say I think that, that translates into being bigger. And I think that means being bigger in terms of touching more members around the world, delivering them entertainment. We'll see that in terms of being bigger, in terms of the amount of engagement that we can drive, the amount of hours that we're satisfying them. That would be bigger in terms of the culture impact is too. I mean you've seen -- I mean just incredible cultural impact in terms of Wednesday, Stranger Things. The ramifications that these shows have in terms of the popular culture are significant, and that's going to get bigger, too. It also means bigger in terms of revenue and profit streams. So we're looking forward to those as well. Right. So losing subs in 2022 and the market reaction or valuation reset is akin to August 2015 when Bob Iger called out the early decline of subs and the impact for Disney's ESPN. It will take a while for Disney to build ESPN Plus into a sports streaming giant. And actually, they may never replace the profitability of ESPN at that point in time. Your pivot seems more broad-based by extending genres and going into new areas, whether it's games, fitness, live, et cetera. Do you see any similarities or differences to that momentous inflection point, which has certainly shifted Wall Street's view from subs to profits? I'll take a shot at that. And then Ted, maybe weigh in. But I think it's a fundamentally different situation. And if you look at where we're at, a significant part of what we need to go do is essentially take the core model that we've been operating since we've been starting in streaming and just execute it better in all dimensions.  And so whether it's the incredible content that Bella and Scott's team are producing constantly, how we're talking about that content to the marketing and conversation that we do, the product experiences and business model innovations that we're doing. But a lot of it really fundamentally is about executing that core model better.  We're not -- there's not a lot of massive pivots away from a traditional legacy business model that we have to go figure out. We're planting some seeds in terms of games and things like that, that if we execute well and we're excited about the progress we're seeing so far, will represent the future potential for us in terms of and more profit opportunities. So that's exciting. But essentially, a lot of this is just continue to execute the play that we've got and do it better and better. And I don't know about what the similarities, but I would say that this business is really completely about engagement, profit and revenue. So -- and we've got to grow all of those things, and all those things are really are tied to executing on that -- on the content. When the content is working, the business is working. We grow engagement, we grow revenue, we grow profit.  There's an interesting thing starting in July and you think about from Stranger Things Season 4 from the phenomena that it became and what we've been able to offer up to our members from that day forward. So they went from Stranger Things to Extraordinary Attorney Woo, which was a phenomenal success throughout Asia and South Korea, but also built a big cult fan-base in the U.S., straight into Sea Beast, which is our biggest animated film ever; straight into Purple Hearts and Gray Man, two of our most watched films ever on Netflix. And then to August, the Sandman and Never Have I Ever Season 3. September, Copra Kai Season 5. Empress, Cyberpunk is this animated adaptation of a video game that's been hailed as one of the greatest of all time.  Narcos, saved another monster hit from North Korea. The Jeffrey Dahmer story, Monster, straight into watchers, go back-to-back hi ts from Ryan Murphy. All Quiet on the Western Front, which just today became the most nominated non-English film in the history of BAFTAs. Only Gandhi has got more nominations in the history of BAFTAs, and that's from Germany with the great Ed Burger. And then straight out of that into Enola Holmes 2, a big monster success, sequel to -- with Millie Bobby Brown.  And you look at all of these things that go back and forth, and they go all the way into January now, we'll end the month with you people, Eddie Murphy and Jonah Hill. Any outlet would kill to have any one of those months as their entire year. And it's our ability to fire on those owners and create hits, but more than that create the expectation that as soon as you're done with this one, there's another one waiting for you. Jessica, just one thing to add. I know but I just think the analogy is kind of fundamentally different. With ESPN and the example you gave, that was a fundamental kind of shift in the industry from 100-plus million pay TV connected homes to cord cutting that's on a path down to mid- to high single-digit reductions in that distribution platform each year, and that's moving in that direction. So it's kind of a shrinking core distribution platform, where when you see in our earnings letter, the world is shifting from linear to streaming.  Even in the largest -- there is no country where streaming is more than 40% of share of TV time. And in many big countries, as you saw, it's less than 5%. So it's our 5% -- or less than 5%, it's less than 10%. So there's an incredible runway still in the shift from linear to streaming. And so for us, it's about growing into that shift and also obviously competing well and continuously innovating and improving.  And what you saw or what we saw and felt when we had that decline in subscribers was really near-term limiters in growing into that big market. But the big market is still growing as opposed to fundamentally long-term limiters in that ESPN shift that you described. Right. So let's move on to some of the drivers of growth, both near and medium term and start with advertising. So your advertising platform has been open only months, and you've amazingly given some money back to advertisers indicating in one way that demand is exceeding supply. The company is, you guys have consistently said you're going to crawl, walk and run. How is the process going relative to your expectations? Yes. Like you say, it's 2 months. And I think the hardest part is actually that first step when you're crawling because you don't really know what exactly to expect as you get it going. And now with 2 months, we're ridiculously early, but we've learned a bunch already, I would say.  So just ticking through this, I mean, I'd say, first and foremost is that we were able to launch this very, very quickly. And the tech is all working. The product experience is good, and that's really a testament to lots of hard work for both Microsoft and Netflix teams who worked very hard to make that happen, and it's really rewarding to that to see. The other, I'd say, pretty significantly fundamental thing is around engagement, and we see that engagement from ads plans users is comparable to sort of similar users on our non-ads plan. So that's really a promising indication. It means we're delivering a solid experience and it's better than we modeled, and that's a great sort of fundamental starting point for us to work with.  Furthermore, now, we're seeing take rate and growth on that ads plan is solid. It's great because partly, that take rate and that growth is due to incremental subscribers coming into the service because we have a lower price point. That's $699 in the U.S., EUR 499 in Germany, just to give you two examples. And so that elasticity is a real -- not only a benefit to sort of growing our ad scale and sustainability, but the general business. I expect to see that continue to actually grow over the year.  That take rate fits sort of within the middle of our other plans, which is another really healthy sign. It means that we've got a complementary set of offerings that are working to sort of satisfy different needs for different consumers at the right mix of features and price points. So that's quite good.  Another important one, I think, for the investor community because it came up a lot before we launched was plan switching. We aren't seeing as expected much switching from high arm subscription plans like premium into our ads plan. So the unit economy remain very good as we modeled. So these are all really good initial sort of progress points, but I think it's important to reiterate that. As you mentioned, we're crawling and we'd like to get to sort of move to the walking phase. We've got a lot to do to get there.  So there's a bunch of technical improvements terms of ad delivery validation, measurement. We've got progress already on that. More to do in the next quarter or 2. Targeting improvements, which will be better for consumers. More relevant advertising, better for advertisers in terms of more value delivered, a better set of offerings on products for advertisers to buy. We've got a long list of experience improvements that we know we can deliver that will live more value to both subscribers and advertisers.  And there's just also some nuts and bolts stuff that we are learning and improving, just things like how do we do a better job with Microsoft at the ad sales and operations processes. There's so much that we need to do both companies need to better serve advertisers sort of an increasing number of advertisers and meet that demand. So we're just getting started. We're constantly improving, and we see the trajectory ahead of us. And really, our aspirations are ultimately successively over a period of years to basically build, just like we have essentially in terms of the streaming experience, the best, most effective, highest quality premium connected TV ads experience as a win for consumers and advertisers and for us as a business. Spence and Greg. Sorry, Jessica. Spence, maybe give a little context on Hulu, kind of what we know about Hulu's advertising. They've got a 10-year head start. And sort of how many years will it take us to sort of pass them in all of these key dynamics? Greg, do you want to go first or you want me? No, I'll hand it over to you. All right. Let's see. I mean Hulu is -- yes, they've had a long head start, they started in the ads business. They have -- we would estimate, reason we obviously don't know exactly, but roughly half of their membership is on the ads tier. It's a multibillion dollar business for them already, and that's a domestic business, U.S. only. So lower reach, lower engagement than us.  So I guess the short story there is we have given what we've seen and what Greg just outlined in terms of the engagement on our ad plan, the strength of the performance in terms of the monetization, kind of the unit economics and our ability to kind of scale in a way that is even better than the kind of comparable ad free plan, plus providing clearly choice that our members or consumers are seeking out because of the sign-up flow that we would expect to be as large or larger over time, certainly in just our U.S. market and more from there.  But it's -- I just want to emphasize, it's a multiyear path. So we're not going to be larger than Hulu in year 1. But hopefully, over the next several years, we can be at least as large, and we wouldn't be getting into this business obviously, Reed, as you know, if it couldn't be a meaningful portion of our business. So we're over $30 billion of revenue, almost $32 billion of revenue. in 2022. And we wouldn't get into a business like this if we didn't believe it could be bigger than at least 10% of our revenue and hopefully much more over time in that mix as we grow. So that's kind of how I see it without putting a specific guide on it. You committed to an upfront market spot, taking CBS's prior spot,CBS Now Power mount spot, which really indicates your long-term advertising goals of being a major advertising platform. Given this is a prime spot on a critical week for advertisers in premium video. Like it's just -- it's amazing how quickly you just took that lot away. What's the run stage? And how would you and what's the time frame to get there? Well, I think as Spence talked about it, it will be an iterative process. To your point, it does signal that we have big aspirations here, and we think there's a big potential opportunity, and so we're committed to incrementally execute against that opportunity.  But just back to Spence's point, we are starting from a 0 base essentially. And also, we're also starting from a history where as a non-ads platform, we had a lot of folks to basically join Netflix fully as non-ad subscribers, and so I think that we'll be working through that over a period of time. But again, our goal and aspiration is that this is a very meaningful and significant source of revenue and profit for us over many years to come. So I mean when you think about the pool of money that you're targeting, linear, let's call it, $50 billion, $60 billion business, seems like the easy money, you've mentioned already. These are shifting from streaming to streaming from linear, so we've seen all of the kind of eyeballs move. And so now you have basically more scale or reach, but the digital pool is much larger. But in the past, you've said you've made comments, the company's made comments that you can't compete with Google and Meta or it would be incredibly difficult to compete with them. Has this changed? Has your view changed? Not really. I would say that initially, we're competing mostly with that sort of traditional TV advertising pool. Now I think we can layer into that over time, components of what has made digital advertising so effective. So if you think about the targeting capability, the fact that we signed in fully addressable. If you think about the growing relevance of first-party data and how we do that, those are real big advantages that we can bring relative certainly to the traditional world.  But again, the form that we have at least for the next couple of years will still be in that sort of lean back -- primarily in that lean back experience. And so that lends itself to certain kinds of advertising and certain kind of advertising goal. And a lot of the demand collection component that a Google or a Facebook is really good at. We won't be well-suited to compete with that for at least some time to come. And Jessica, just to add to that. The good news, as you saw in the letter, is that, that branded video ad market that Greg talked about us focusing on is about $180 billion, globally ex China and Russia. So we have plenty to do and a lot of opportunity ahead just in that area alone. Yes. No, it's an enormous opportunity, but there's also, besides advertising, there's enormous opportunity in incremental subscribers, as you have mentioned. You are the lowest priced service, at least now you are the lowest price, but can you frame the opportunity in terms of sub growth and how you're thinking about it? Sure. And just to comment on lowest price. I mean, again, we don't really think about the pricing question from it perspective. Again, we're -- think of ourselves as a nonsubstitutable good when you think about Wednesday or you think about Glass Onion, these are titles you can only see on Netflix that's extremely powerful. Scott and Bella are delivering more incredible titles that are nonsubstitutable in that regard.  So really, when you think about the pricing question is how do we offer a wide range of options for a wide range of consumers. We want to make that spectrum even wider as we seek to serve more members around the world and trying to deliver appropriate value at those different price points, and we're doing a good job expanding that range.  And so then you think about so there's sort of two pools of incremental subscribers. There's a bunch of people around the world in countries where we're not deeply penetrated, and we have more opportunity to go attract them. A component of that is we've got folks that are watching Netflix who aren't paying us as part of basically borrowing somebody else's credentials. And our goal is over this year to basically work through that situation and convert many of those folks to be paid accounts or to have the account owner pay for them to get enough subscription. But either way, we're seeking to sort of monetize the viewing value that we're delivering.  And then beyond that, it's back to Spence's comment, even our most penetrated market we're 8% of total TV time, which is potentially a relatively narrow length to think about the broad competitive entertainment offering. So we have huge opportunity to grow the engagement component of that several X. We feel like we can get to if we do a great job of executing across all fronts, and that represents a tremendous opportunity for more entertainment value delivered, and we believe that the revenue flows from that in time. Before we get to password sharing, just one last advertising question. You now have roughly a decade of producing your own IP. Any thoughts on offering a fast service over time, readvertising supported television? Ted, do you want to take this one? Yes. Look, we're open to all these different models that are out there right now, but we've got a lot on our plate this year, both with the paid sharing and with our launch of advertising and continuing to this slate of content that we're trying to drive to our members. So we are keeping an eye on that segment for sure. So on the password sharing, what will drive consumers to pay $3 or $4 per sharing versus becoming a sub with their own profile? Is it affordability? Is there something else? What do you expect? Yes. I think there's a range of motivations for different borrowers. So some of it is economically driven and so a part of what we're trying to do is that we are being responsive to that and finding the right price points, whether in terms of an individual account or an extra member affordance. And obviously, the ad-supported plans give us the opportunity present a lower consumer face pricing in those countries where we have advertising.  Part of it is just what we call casual sharing, which is people could pay, but they don't need to, and so they're borrowing somebody's account. And so our job is to give them a little bit of a nudge and to create features that make transitioning to their own account easy and simple. So we have this basically a profile export feature, which allows you to take your viewing history and all the great recommendations with you. So to your point, there's a range of motivations and I think a range of solutions that we'll be able to offer to land people in different places. Can you provide any details, including the time frame for converting borrowers to paying accounts? Yes. So we've been working hard at this and trying to do some sort of thoughtful experimentation to let our members speak to us in terms of what set of solutions work for them. So that's the testing that you've seen us do over the last couple of quarters.  We feel like we have gotten to a good set of features. It's the profile export that I mentioned, but there's also a bunch of account management features that we think are important to making this experience work for folks. And so we're ready to roll those out later this quarter. We'll stagger that a bit as we sort of work sets of countries, but we'll really see that happen over the next couple of quarters.  And I think it's worth noting that this will not be a universally popular move, so there will current members that are unhappy with this move. We'll see a bit of a cancel reaction to that. We think of this as similar to what we see when we raise prices. So we get some increased churn associated with that for a period of time. But then generally, what happens is both from the specific changes that we make, we'll see folks come on as new subscribers, essentially borrowers creating their accounts or incremental monetization through the extra member that will happen shortly thereafter.  And then clearly, our job is to continue to grow value, right, to have more amazing titles that people cannot wait to see and whether that's satisfying those members to make those transitions or winning back essentially folks who have turned off the service and bringing them back on the service over the months and years to come. Jessica, sorry, I just -- maybe just because we touched on it a little bit in the letter, but just to kind of reinforce a little bit of what that looks like in terms of timing and guidance. So those dynamics that Greg just walked through, because of that as we kind of start to roll this out later in Q1, based on the timing, what we talked about is that we'll have modest growth we expect in paid net adds in Q1, but kind of atypical seasonality, where typically Q2 would be a softer paid net add quarter. It will probably be a larger paid net add quarter. And most importantly, what we're most focused on is obviously revenue. That is our primary metric.  And what you see is in the guide, these revenue initiatives between paid sharing rolling out and then scaling ads, you don't see much of that in Q1, which is why we're forecasting 80% growth, FX neutral in Q1 revenue. But throughout the course of the year, we would expect to see accelerating revenue growth as we roll out paid sharing broadly across our business and then obviously, scale adds throughout the year, which is a more gradual build. So I just want to kind of highlight that, and that's kind of what you're seeing in the guidance. And given the revenue drivers of paid sharing and advertising, how are you thinking about price increases in the current year? Is it just too complicated? How are you thinking about it? Well, I would say the two initiatives that you described represent the bulk of our pricing strategy in '23. We anticipate that they'll both be revenue positive, revenue accretive significantly. So in the -- according to the details that Spence just offered.  Now having said that, our core sort of pricing approach in theory remains the same, and so we're going to look at the metrics that our members are giving us and telling us and look for opportunities where we've -- I think we've done a good job of creating more value for them and for a certain customer segment and a certain tier and a certain country, we think we've done a good job at delivering more entertainment for them. And then we'll go back and opportunistically ask for them to pay a little bit more so that keep this virtuous cycle going and really invest that back into incredible content and stories. And maybe, Ted, I don't know if you want to highlight anything you see comment on that side. No, I would just say that it's the must-seeness of the content that will make the paid sharing initiative work. It's -- that will make the advertising launch work that will make continuing to grow revenue work. And so it's across film, across television. It's the content that people must see and then it's on Netflix gives us the ability to do that. And we're super proud of the team and their ability to keep delivering on that month in and month out and quarter in and quarter out and continuing to grow in all these different market segments that our consumers really care about. So that, to me, is core to all these initiatives working, and we've got the wind at our back on that right now. But you amazingly continue to expand the genres of content, which, as you guys have mentioned, clearly drives engagement. But the most recent new genre, which you introduced on your platform in -- at the end of last -- very end of last month is fitness. Just in time for your New Year's resolution, yes. One class online could be the price of a Netflix subscription. So while many of the work at our bite size. I mean some along, they're simple, but deceivingly effective. Can you talk about what your plans are in this area? And as you develop more content, it really, as I said, drives value for anyone who would work out anywhere else. So how do you define success? And is there anything you could take about partner economics with Nike? Yes. We can't comment on the partner economics, but I would tell you that we've historically stayed away from the fitness category because it's abundantly available online. In many cases, for free, as you know. But we thought if we could partner with a great brand, and Nike is certainly a leading brand in fitness with really well-produced content, which this content is, and then let's go out to our members and see if it's something that they value. And we'll see that in the engagement and see where we could take it from there.  So I think in that way, working with a great partner and the high quality, to your point, of the content itself, will put it in a really good test, do people want to use Netflix to get in shape or to get back in shape. And if they do, we'd like to keep serving that. And if they don't, we'll keep poking around. So it's the way we kind of -- we're able to test the market at a very high end with a premium brand partner. There's constant speculation that you will experiment with sports, which is an expensive rental business for many. Does having an advertising offering change your views on offering sports? And any thoughts that you -- on like WWE, which is for sale, that could be -- potentially, I just think that could be owned content like any views on sports. Yes. Look, I'd say in sports, our position has been the same, which is we really -- we're not anti-sports for pro profits, and we've not been able to figure out how to deliver profits in renting big league sports in our subscription model. Not to say that, that won't change. We'll be open to it, but that's where it's at today. And in WWE, we look at -- we have a lot of M&A activity all the time. We look at all of them, but nothing we can comment on. Does this term play a roll in your investments into live events? Live comedy specials seems to have a value outside of the live window. Other events, like you just announced that you're going to host the SAG Awards. Sports, obviously. These have fairly short lives. So how do you balance the investment in live versus the potential to drive advertising dollars? I would look at this as part of just like other crawl/walk/run scenarios, where we are really looking at our content that would benefit creatively for being live. So the results show for one of our competition series that we have or a reunion show that drives news or like the SAG Awards and opportunity to engage audiences live. And because we've got the shelf space, we can do hours of shoulder programming around the live events and all of those things that our members may enjoy. So think -- there's nothing particularly novel about live television, as you know. But we are dabbling in it, starting with our Chris Rock Live concert to try to create the excitement around live for those things that are uniquely more exciting to be live. The theatrical release of Glass Onion was incredibly successful in its limited release. But -- so for some , it looks like you left a lot of money on the table by not continuing beyond the first one week. Do you have any regrets? Or can you give us your thoughts on your evolving film strategy? Well, I'm thrilled with every aspect of the release of Glass Onion, starting with Ryan Johnson, and he's a great film -- and Scott Stuber and the film team for bringing it to the table. And I think what you saw was a lot of excitement. We drove a ton of us with that theatrical release, and we created a bunch of demand. And that demand, we fulfilled on our subscription service. So our core business is making movies for our members to watch on Netflix, and that's where we're really focused, and everything else is really a tactic to drive excitement around those films. So look like a massive global hit like a Wednesday. There seems to be so many ways you could drive monetization. I know like just staying with margin for a second. Like the Wednesday makeup was sold down in every Max Store in New York City. You could not buy it anywhere. Do you participate in these types of consumer products? Or is it just a way to fuel balance, fuel engagement? It's a little -- mostly the fuel engagement and fuel fandom. We actually -- we do participate in it. Our owned content, we do drive a lot of revenue in our consumer products business. But mostly, the motivation is that is to drive fandom. And Greg alluded to this earlier, but this impact on the culture that this content can have on our platform. In our earnings letter, we mentioned the Lady Gaga song came back after 11 years because of Wednesday. But that doesn't mention, the 4 songs this year that we actually jammed back into the charts, some that never charted and some that were off the charts for 40 years from Metallica, Kate Bush, The Cramps. And that impact on culture, Sofia Carson's music career took off because of Purple Hearts. Jenna Ortega picked up 10 million social media followers in the first week Wednesday launched on Netflix.  And all of these folks who built these gigantic careers on Netflix then go on to have to own their own companies, sell their own makeup in many cases and become incredibly powerful influencers. And all that business is drawn because of our -- the impact that this distribution platform, and its incredible UI that basically can take something like Wednesday, which was not a slam dunk for people to predict that people would love it as much as they do. And the UI could pick up on that activity in the early going of the release and push it out to where it's going to be one of our most watched shows in our history all over the world. And we do use consumer products as a way to intensify fandom. And it could be anything from makeup from Wednesday, as you said. Or maybe even a hand on your shoulder, Spence? Yes. You never know where Wednesday is going to show up or at least thing. I did get my chance to kind of talk and -- and at the risk of going back to the management changes and say, I am thrilled with the changes. I'm going to miss maybe not seeing Reed as frequently as he's supporting Greg and Ted. So I just brought in a little bit of reinforcement with thing even though Reed is not going anywhere. But this way, I've got a little daily reinforcement. Sticking with content for a few minutes. The local language hits a building, but so as the U.S. hits. How do you think about allocating your $17 billion or so content budget between genres or languages? Like is there any way like you can kind of parse it out? Yes. It's a big task. Watching where viewing is growing and where it's suffering and where we are under programming and over programming around the world is a big task of the job. Spence and his team support Bella and her team in making those allocations, figuring out between film and television, between local language and what is -- and what's really interesting is there aren't that many global hits, meaning that everyone in the world watches the same thing. Squid Game was very rare in that way. And Wednesday looks like one of those too, very rare in that way. There are countries like Japan, as an example, or even Mexico that have a real preference for local content, even when we have our big local hits.  And every once in a while, something like Squid Game is even a big hit in the U.S. So think about in Q4, we launched a top 10 non-English series nearly every week of the quarter from South Korea, from Spain, from Colombia, from Japan, from Poland. And so the benefit of that kind of local language investment and the benefit of doing that early was that we become exceptional on the ground in those countries. Those content teams generate not just content people want to see, but content that's leading the industry.  To have Netflix produce the Academy Award entry film for both Mexico and Germany has never happened in the history of the Oscars. It's really phenomenal. And I mentioned earlier the All Quiet on the Western front and the success of BAFTA. And keep in mind that these investments are important because it actually increases the total addressable audience for Netflix around the world. Because if we were just doing English content for the world, we would be mostly attracting Western-centric viewers, but our addressable audience is anyone who's watching TV anywhere in the world. Jessica, we have time for one or two last questions. I just want to make sure you have a chance to ask about margins or anything else you might want to. So let's move away from content then. So free cash flow. First of all, like, what an inflection point, $1.6 billion 2, roughly $3 billion in '23, $4 billion plus probably in '24. Can you just talk about -- historically, you've been more build than buy. Is there any change in philosophy as cash starts accelerating? Can you talk about overall capital priorities? And what's driving that operating margin increase? Spencer, why don't you go first with the capital allocation philosophy, if you like. Sure. Thanks, Jessica. So as we wrote in the letter, no change at all to our capital structure policy or allocation guidance, which is to, first and foremost, reinvest in the core business and selective acquisitions after that. Those are the main priorities. Beyond that, if we have cash in excess of our minimum cash levels, which we -- which is roughly equates to 2 months of revenue, then we'll return that to shareholders or share program. Yes. And I can pick up with margins, I can start with. It's a bit of an explanation. But if you like, in terms of just in the near-ish term, our outlook for '23 and then just generally, what's driving our outlook. But what you saw in the letter, it kind of dates back, frankly.  If we walk back to where we were in the beginning of 2022, when we saw a slowing revenue growth, we said, \"We're going to manage to operating margin of 19% to 20% FX neutral at those January 2022 rates.\" And we ended the year at 20%, so at the high end of that range. And now as we kind of turn the page to '23, first, I should say, with everything we talked about, we've got -- we're quite optimistic in terms of our path forward.  I also just want to highlight there is also kind of short-term unusual amount of less visibility than typical because the things we're talking about in terms of our revenue initiatives, whether it's scaling our ad platform, launching paid sharing, which globally rolled out yet, these things are early days. And then also all multinationals have a level of macro uncertainty. So that's a bit of a caveat in terms of the variability in the forecast.  But what we see is we see with the -- our path to accelerating revenue growth and our high confidence there that as we turn forward to '23, we're guiding to now 21% to 22% FX-neutral operating margins at those same January 2022 rates. We're now in a new year, so we take it forward to January '23 to current rates, and that's a range of our operating margin guidance of 18% to 20%.  So now FX neutral for '23, we're going to manage within that band to deliver at least within 18% to 20% operating margin guide. So that is growing margins, growing absolute profit. And really what's reflected in there is that this -- we have high confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue throughout the course of the year as we scale ads and we launch paid sharing. We've got high confidence in improving the service and the strength of our content slate with everything that Ted discussed here on the call, and we're also continuing to manage our cost structure with increasing discipline. You saw that in the back half with our slowing expense growth, and we'll carry that through similarly in '23.  So that all lends itself to our focus, which is kind of healthy growing double-digit revenue growth and accelerating that revenue growth throughout the year, expanding our -- both our absolute profit and profit margin and then growing positive free cash flow. So that's all reflected again with the big caveat that there's a bit less visibility than typical in this near term. That's something we'll continue to work through. We'll obviously know a lot more over the next couple of quarters, a few quarters as we roll out paid sharing, and we'll update guidance as appropriate. But that's what plays through and then also plays through cash flow generation that you see, where we believe with all those dynamics and managing at about the same level of cash content spend that we'll have more than $3 billion, at least $3 billion of free cash flow in the year. Thank you, Spence, for that answer and, Jessica, for the last question on all your questions. And before I turn it over to Reed for closing remarks, I just want to say as a longtime Netflix employee, as formerly prior to that as an analyst covering Netflix for many years, Reed, it has been a real privilege to work alongside you. And on behalf of all Netflix employees, we thank you for everything you've done for us and the company over the past 25 years, and we're all super excited for the next chapter with you as our executive and Ted and Greg as our co-CEOs.  So with that, over to you, Reed, to make some... It's Spencer. I just -- because I can't just deal with this thing. I just want to thank Reed as well. This is not a goodbye, I know. But it's been fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a more incredible experience in the past 4 years with you as our leader, learned so much. across everything from work to humanity. And I'm so thrilled with the next chapter with Greg and Ted and you and so super excited. And thanks, Reed. Reed, you might be muted. Thanks, you guys. It's certainly not goodbye. I'm heavily invested in Netflix' success. So there's been 83 earnings calls now, and I honestly have loved them. I love the interaction. But it's time for Greg and Ted and the team to lead, and I'll be in the prep sessions, but this will be my last earnings call on screen.  Overall, I would say our first 25 years were good, and I'm super excited about Netflix's next 25 years being great under our broadened leadership team. Pleasing our shareholders and members is so satisfying, and I just want to thank all of you for your support and look forward to continued more progress. Thank you, everyone."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead. Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings.  Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Olivier. Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our fourth quarter results and follow with a quick review of our full year 2022 achievements. Then I will share some thoughts on the outlook for the full year. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results, and we will open for your questions.  To begin, we sustained growth momentum through the fourth quarter, delivering strong revenue growth and further margin expansion, both sequentially and year-over-year. The quarter was characterized by very strong activity growth in the Middle East and offshore and was augmented by robust year-end sales in Digital.  Growth was once again broad-based, and our operational, commercial and earnings performance was outstanding. We ended the fourth quarter with sequential revenue growth and margin expansion in North America and in all international areas. In the international markets, quarterly revenue topped $6 million for the first time in more than 4 years. Additionally, our international revenue growth rate has visibly outpaced international rig count growth since the cycle trough in 2020. Service pricing, new technology and digital adoption all continued to trend positively.  Looking broadly over the second half of the year, the pace of growth in North America significantly moderated. At the same time, international accelerated, growing in excess of 20% compared to the first half of the year, almost twice the growth rate of North America. We are clearly witnessing the start of a new phase of -- in the growth cycle, which will increasingly be delivered by resilient international growth. This market dynamic led to a lower-than-usual cash flow performance at year-end. However, we further reduced net debt during the quarter and closed the year below our leverage target.  Overall, this fourth quarter results helped us surpass our revised full year revenue guidance, and we closed with EPS, [ pre- ] segment operating income and margins all at the highest levels in 7 years.  Switching to the full year. 2022 was pivotal for our industry and for SLB. It marked the second consecutive year of outperformance for the energy sector, providing further evidence of the multi-year up cycle and investment momentum that is underway. I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on what we achieved.  We announced our new brand identity with sustainability embedded in everything we do and opened a new chapter for the company. This, firmly positioned, helped SLB to benefit from the underlying macro trends that will shape the future of the energy: Oil and gas technology innovation, industrial decarbonization, digital transformation and new energy systems.  We executed consistently for our customers, achieving our best safety and operation integrated performance on record. We advanced our technology leadership and service quality differentiation, leading to more contract awards, higher technology adoption and increased pricing premium.  In our Core divisions, we expanded pretax operating margins by more than 300 basis points. This was led by well construction, which expanded margins by more than 550 basis points. We also launched new products, service and solutions that increase efficiency and lower operational emissions. You have seen many examples of this in today's press release.  Our fit-for-basin, technology access and transition technology portfolio have fueled growth and margin expansion in every division and every geographic area throughout the year. And we continue to strengthen our Core portfolio for growth and position for future resilience and returns with the acquisition of Gyrodata and the announced joint venture with Aker Solutions for Subsea.  In Digital, we had strong growth in exploration data, INNOVATION FACTORI and AI solution sales, and the adoption of our new tech digital platform is accelerating. We ended the year with more than 270 DELFI customers, more than 70% growth in DELFI users, and our SaaS revenue more than doubled. These positive undercurrents, combined with higher APS revenue, contributed to the Digital & Integration division's expanding pretax operating margins by more than 170 basis points.  We continue to build adjacent expansion opportunities for our Digital business, both in operation data space and beyond oil and gas, such as carbon management.  And in New Energy, we progress technology development milestones, established new partnership partner in CCUS and made new investments that have created a focused yet comprehensive portfolio that offers promising growth opportunity for the future. Today, this portfolio comprise 5 business areas: Carbon solutions, hydrogen, geothermal and geo-energy, critical minerals and stationary energy storage. And we are accelerating our R&D efforts to develop technology solutions that address hard-to-abate industrial and power generation emissions.  As you see, our 3 engines of growth are on solid footing and are positioned for market success. In sustainability, we reduced our own carbon emissions intensity in Scopes 1 and 2. And we continue to be one of the highest-ranked companies in our industry across the 4 rating agencies.  We also made significant advance, launching SLB End-to-End Emission Solution, or SEES, an industry first to help our oil and gas customers address methane and other greenhouse gas emissions.  Finally, for our shareholders, we demonstrated our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase announced today. And we resumed our share buyback program this month.  These achievements highlight a remarkable year for SLB. It speaks to how we have successfully leveraged the breadth of our portfolio and our competitive strengths to deliver clear, leading outcomes for our customers and shareholders. We are primed for significant success and look forward to carrying momentum into the year ahead. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire SLB team for delivering an outstanding year.  Moving to the macro. We enter 2023 against a backdrop of market fundamentals that remain compelling for both oil and gas and low carbon energy resource.  First, despite concern for potential economic slowdown in certain regions, oil and gas demand growth remains resilient. The IEA forecasts that oil and gas demand will grow by 1.9 million barrels to reach approximately 102 million barrels per day. In parallel, markets will remain tightly supplied with modest production increase offset by the end of SPR release and well productivity declines in certain regions, most notably in North America.  Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in a number of new project sanctions, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at the pace unforeseen just 18 months ago.  And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment.  In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained off an exceptionally strong year in 2022. Capital spending growth is expected to increase in high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins, and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue.  Turning to international. Markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically and more broadly in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030. Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tieback and new development projects mobilize and new FID are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract.  Excluding Russia, customers' capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle. This outlook is very favorable for SLB with multiple paths for resilient growth in Core, Digital and New Energy.  On a full year basis, our ambition is to grow revenue in excess of 15% compared to 2022, supported by the step-up in international and offshore momentum, which will augment growth established in North America. As a result, year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth will be in the mid-20s, driven by further margin expansion.  More specifically, in the international markets, we foresee growth in the high teens, excluding Russia, which is set to decline this year. We expect the highest growth rates to be realized in the Middle East and in offshore markets, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. North America, we anticipate about 20% growth supported by offshore strength, land drilling activity and higher pricing. Full year margin expansion will be driven by further positive pricing dynamics, increased technology adoption and improvements from our enhanced operating leverage, mainly internationally.  Let me share with you how we see this year unfolding. Directionally, during the first quarter, we anticipate a typical pattern of activity, beginning with the combined effect of seasonality and the absence of year-end product and digital sales.  Additionally, the first quarter will reflect some impact of year-on-year Russia activity decline. This will be followed by a rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth trajectory in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This typical pattern of activity and the favorable dynamics I described earlier combine to support the ambition we have set for full year growth and margin expansion.  In addition, the beneficial impacts of an earlier-than-expected reopening in China, the easing of inflationary trends and any further restriction on Russia exports could lead to an acceleration of short cycle activity globally and fast tracking of FID internationally. This could present further upside over the second half of the year.  I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.71. This represents an increase of $0.08 compared to the third quarter and an increase of $0.30 or 73% when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.03, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.74. You can find details of the components of this net credit in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release.  Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. All divisions posted sequential revenue growth, led by Digital & Integration and Reservoir Performance. From a geographical perspective, North America revenue grew 6% sequentially, while international revenue grew 5%, led by the Middle East.  Fourth quarter pretax operating margins of 19.8% improved 104 basis points sequentially and 393 basis points year-on-year. Notably, over 70% of our geo units posted their best margins since 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 24.4% was 219 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year, exceeding the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.  Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1 billion increased 12% sequentially with pretax operating margins expanding 386 basis points to 37.7%. This growth was driven by year-end exploration data licensing sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Africa, increased APS project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally.  Reservoir Performance revenue increased 7% sequentially, while margins expanded 146 basis points, primarily due to new projects and activity gains internationally, led by the Middle East and the offshore basins.  Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion increased 5% sequentially due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East and in Latin America. Margins of 21% declined 50 basis points as improved profitability from the higher activity in the Middle East and Latin America was more than offset by the onset of seasonal effects in the northern hemisphere.  Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was up 3% sequentially on higher international sales of artificial lift, completions and midstream production systems, partially offset by reduced sales of valves and subsea production systems. Margins improved 32 basis points due to favorable technology and project mix.  Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $1.6 billion, and free cash flow was $855 million. This performance did not reflect the increase we typically experience in the last quarter of the year as free cash flow was $200 million lower than in the previous quarter. This was due to a combination of the following 4 factors.  First, we experienced extraordinary year-on-year fourth quarter revenue growth of 27%, representing incremental revenue of almost $1.7 billion.  Second, our inventory balance increased 22% year-on-year to support our increasing product backlog driven by the sizable share of tender awards we have secured going into 2023.  Third, we pulled forward certain investments in CapEx in order to fully seize the continued revenue growth expected in 2023, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. As a result, our capital investments increased $255 million sequentially. Our full year 2022 capital investments were therefore $2.3 billion, as compared to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Despite this increase, the CapEx portion of our capital investments was still at the midpoint of our 5% to 7% of revenue target.  Lastly, lower-than-expected year-end accounts receivable collections contributed to reduced free cash flow. As you may recall, we had exceptional cash collections in the fourth quarter of 2021. We did not achieve the same level of year-end collections as last year. And as a result, our DSO in Q4 2022 was approximately 5 days higher than at the same time last year. However, it is worth noting that our 2022 year-end DSO was the second best we have achieved going back at least 2 decades. Therefore, this is just a timing issue.  Beyond free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the partial monetization of our investment in the Arabian Drilling Company, an onshore and offshore drilling rig company in Saudi Arabia. ADC completed an initial public offering during the fourth quarter. And in connection with this IPO, we sold a portion of our interest in the secondary offering that resulted in us receiving net proceeds of $223 million. We currently have a 34% interest in ADC.  We also sold an additional portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $218 million of net proceeds during the quarter. We currently have a 5% interest in Liberty.  As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $9.3 billion. This represents an improvement of approximately $400 million sequentially and $1.7 billion compared to the end of 2021. This also represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Consequently, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.4.  In addition, our gross debt reduced by almost $2 billion during the year. We repaid in the fourth quarter $900 million of debt that matured and repurchased $800 million of notes that were going to come due in 2024 and 2025. As a result of our strong operating results and the net debt reduction, our return on capital employed for 2022 was 13%, representing its highest level since 2014.  Now looking ahead to 2023. We expect total capital investments, consisting of CapEx and investments in APS and exploration data, to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion as compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. Based on this, our capital investments will grow at a slower pace than our expected revenue growth in 2023.  As a result, and when taking into account our 2023 guidance for EBITDA to increase in the mid-20s when compared to 2022, we are confident that our free cash flow will increase significantly in 2023. Accordingly, we reaffirm our ambition to deliver a minimum average of 10% free cash flow margin through the 2021 to 2025 period. This will allow us to continue increasing returns to shareholders as we leverage both the length and strength of the current growth cycle. Specifically for 2023, we expect to distribute visibly more than 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders between dividends and stock buybacks.  Today, we declared the 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, in line with our announcement at our recent Investor Day event. In addition, we have resumed our share repurchase program this month and are targeting a minimum amount of $200 million for the quarter. For 2023, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.  I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for opening the floor to the questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. So I guess the first thing I wanted to touch on, Olivier, is the international business had a really strong second half, particularly strong fourth quarter. But from everything I understand and see in the market, is we're really just getting started with ramping activity, particularly in the Middle East, particularly in some of the offshore markets. But we're in the early stages of that. And so there should be a further acceleration in international activity. I know you gave some guidance for '23 in terms of what you're anticipating in terms of revenue and EBITDA.  But how would you characterize the next several quarters? We'll see, of course, the normal seasonality in 1Q. But as we get into kind of 2Q, 3Q of next year, we should see kind of big volume increases. And then of course price increases on top of that. No, indeed. I think let me reframe a little bit of the guidance we shared. As we see today, the combination of offshore, Middle East and broad gas investments internationally will continue to support a very solid growth internationally.  We are seeing, as we have seen in the fourth quarter, an uptick into the rate of growth for Middle East, and that's driven by a commitment to oil capacity increase and further gas developments. And this, as I commented briefly in my prepared remarks, will lead Middle East investment to be on record, ever, as we anticipated in this year or next year. And as a result, will generate significant pull for our revenue going forward.  But I think what I will say is that what is characterizing international, as we see it, is that it has a lot of resilience because it's multi-pronged, it's multiple engines, short and long, oil and gas, offshore and onshore. And I believe that the multiyear commitments for capacity expansion and gas development in Middle East is combining with offshore long cycle, a return of deepwater, which is the operating environment that will see the most activity increase this year. And also the return or the acceleration of exploration and appraisal offshore, which should be one of the defining characteristics of the quarters to come.  So when you combine all of this, you are getting a very resilient multi-pronged and multiyear sustained growth pattern for international market. And I think that's what we see. And it will indeed support not only growth this year, but it will support your growth next year and the years to come. And it will be multi-pronged and fairly broad and with multiple geographic impact. Right. That's exactly what we're seeing. So excellent there. And then maybe if I could hone in just as a follow-up on the offshore markets because that's an area where Schlumberger has -- or sorry, SLB has an increased market share. It's also a high technology area of the business.  Could you maybe talk through some of the things that are happening in offshore, shallow water plus really the deepwater area? And especially, what you're seeing in exploration and appraisal? Because that's, as you said, the defining characteristic here. And we haven't seen exploration in, well, a long time. So I'd love to get your thoughts there. Yes, absolutely. First, I think to define, offshore has been, I think, seeing an uptick that started about 18 months ago. We don't see it abating and we see it continue to steadily grow.  I think what is changing this year is that whereas the shallow water environment was leading the growth to a large extent in the early part of this offshore cycle expansion, we are seeing the deepwater to catch up. And including, indeed, exploration and appraisal activity that is set to visibly outpace international offshore activity actually. So deepwater will be the highest operating environment activity growth in 2023. And as part of it, exploration and appraisal will be also outpacing and certainly rebounding.  So it's visible in multiple region. And I think you have seen East Mediterranean with a couple of announcements by 2 or 3 major announcement of gas discovery that are set to be appraised further and then for future development. You have seen some, last year, announcement in the South Africa and Namibia Basin that also get additional appraisal and future development. And you have seen that the East Atlantic margin and/or Suriname and Guyana remains very hot. And finally, East Asia is also seeing some deepwater gas exploration at the same time.  So you have this 4 or 5 offshore mostly deepwater area that are seeing exploration and appraisal. Results of gas and oil energy -- gas and energy security and oil -- pursuit of oil reserve replacements by major and by national -- large national oil companies. So I think this is happening.  And this builds on top of the very high shallow water activity that has already rebounded and is set to further accelerate in the Middle East, where, be it in Saudi, in UAE or in Qatar, we have a combination of oil and gas offshore development plans that are in place. So offshore outlook is strong and is here to stay for years to come. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Olivier. So 2 things really kind of -- 2 things really stood out to me today. I guess the first was you calling this a distinctive new phase of the cycle. But also really kind of what it means for the duration of the cycle, what I'd like to ask you about.  So first, on the Middle East. It's clearly not taken center stage. You've talked about a record level of upshoot in spending in the next few years. In a lot of ways, it's feeling like 2005 again. But I was wondering if you could talk about how this cycle could be different for SLB in this region, from the perspective of the types of work you're performing, how are the contracts being tendered differently? And really, what that means for the pricing opportunity, both within discrete services and integrated contracts? No. Thank you, Dave. Let me comment first on your remark on durability. I really believe that the cycle that we have entered internationally, that is characterized now by the Middle East joining the growth engine, if you like, is set to be very durable. I think -- and the driver of that, as I said, is a combination of 4 or 5 countries having committed capacity expansion for oil production for the future, and that are much in need as we can see that the tight supply is here to stay and to stretch the market. And also for regional gas development.  And this is happening simultaneously in multiple countries. So this is set to happen, and will not last 1 year. These are long cycle offshore, onshore gas, and some of it on commercial and oil development. So this is first, durability is here to stay, and we are talking about years. And I think the targets are expanding anywhere from to 2027 to 2030, depending on the country, depending on the ambition they have on sustained capacity production.  So second is that what is quite unique, and this is a combination of offshore, onshore oil, gas, commercial oil and noncommercial oil. I think you have the Qatar commercial gas development, it is only set to further increase. You have the noncommercial development in Saudi. And in UAE, you have the other gas development in the region, including the East Med that has a -- fundamental potential of East Med gas development. And then you have the mix of offshore, onshore that I think is quite unique, particularly on the rebound on the shallow water increase of activity that you have seen.  So that is unique and that gives us a unique opportunity to outperform and to use our fit-for-basin, to use our local content, to use our customer centricity and engagement that we have in the region, and to build on those market position to really benefit. And we are poised to certainly have record revenue in Middle East in -- during this cycle, and eclipse previous 2014 peak by a margin. And how are the contracts different? Before -- last cycle, I don't think we really talked about integrated drilling contracts or kind of the LSTK contracts. I think it was mostly discrete services. So is that different today? And how does that change sort of your business? Is there more opportunity? There is some more risk there as well. I think that what would characterize this cycle is performance. It's all about performance. And I think our ability to perform in this integrated contract, and as you have seen, what we have shared during this press release on the Jafurah contract and been able to up our performance to peer some of the North America performance. And performance will dictate market allocation, market share allocation and will dictate technology adoption.  So our ability to fit for basin, our technology like we did in Qatar and other region, and local content like we're doing Saudi and other region, I think, is giving us opportunity to earn this contract and to use a pricing premium for this technology adoption to deploy digital. And you have seen the announcement we made a few months back with -- in the sustainability platform with Saudi Aramco, and more announcements will come.  So we are building our future in Middle East on multiple engines, and we are building them on the performance in execution, technology adoption and differentiation. And LSTK, while being a part of the landscape of the way we operate, is not the largest piece of our business in the Middle East. And just as a secondary question -- second question, just a follow-up on what James was asking about on the offshore side. Obviously, you feel confident in the duration. We're seeing this kind of shallow water business which you didn't really have in the Middle East before. But thinking about the deepwater side, we're seeing rig contracting picking up materially. Petrobras, it seems to be cornering the market on deepwater rigs. So I guess my question is sort of similar to my other question, how is this different this time?  Is the customer base changing much from what you see? Is it going to be the same big players that we saw the last time? And so is that changing much? And I'm just sort of thinking that should we be expecting to see a bit more of a pronounced inflection in the second half of the year as deepwater comes on? Yes. I think that's what we are predicting as well. I think as I've indicated, the deepwater, we see the highest activity uptick compared to shallow and land because land is being impacted by the activity compression and decline in Russia internationally. And hence, this is what we anticipate as well, and we don't expect this to stop at the end of the quarter or next year -- this year. So this trend is set to continue, indeed. Next, we go to Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Obviously, you covered a lot of ground on kind of international, the outlook, the multiyear outlook, pricing momentum is starting to build. And we touched a little bit on Dave's question here on offshore. So I kind of want to dig into that a little bit more and talk specifically on subsea.  We keep hearing a lot of anecdotes out there, some really strong margins that are starting to get booked in backlog. So could you speak to the subsea market? What kind of fundamentals you're seeing out there? And I don't know if you're willing to kind of talk to -- if you think the industry, not necessarily Schlumberger, but if the industry can kind of get back to prior cycle peak margins on the subsea side. I cannot comment on that industry. I think I can comment on what I see as activity outlook and what we see in our backlog and type of activity for subsea. So the undercurrent, if I was to use that terminology for subsea, are very strong because, on the outlook, the mid- and long-term outlook, because of this deepwater activity, that includes exploration, appraisal and future development. FID. Offshore FID for 2023 is set to be the highest since 2012, 2013, indicating that there is a pipeline of subsea activity in the horizon. And we have seen some of it materializing in our this year.  We are seeing also some infill drilling, tieback activity, which benefited us in recent quarters. And we are very, very sure that the market is inflecting for further growth. And indeed, the conditions are set for price to be accretive into the margin, into the backlog going forward to build up and to resume some extent previous subsea margin.  But I cannot comment on the industry at large, but I believe this is an industry that is very critical to the success of offshore development, and where we see a lot of collaboration, engagement, technology development. And critical technologies like subsea processing, boosting, and trends are positive as we see it.  And we are -- as you know, we made a strategic decision to align with -- to form a JV with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7 to address that market opportunity. And that, this announcement, reflects our view on the market. Absolutely. All right. Just one follow-up, unrelated. If we kind of look at 1Q and just kind of think about the moving pieces, you walked through some of this with international seasonality. I didn't hear anything kind of explicitly on North America. But I don't know if you can kind of just step us through 1Q, moving pieces between North America and international. And maybe some color around margins. Yes, first, because you pick on it, I think I'd like to first reflect on North America. North America has been a fantastic success in the last 18 months, 24 months. I think the rate of growth that the team has achieved, both in offshore and in land market, has outpaced the regrowth visibly. The success in our technology offering and fit and tech access model, that has been very successful there.  I think as we expanded margin, as you have seen, our margin, the very, I would say, distant if not very accretive level today in North America. So this is a very good base to be on.  And as the market 2023 unfolds, first day is a little bit of a shift to drilling to rebuild the DUC inventory that will favor us in a month and a couple of quarters to come, before the usual plateauing or a moderation of growth in the second half.  [ Which it pins ] a level of rig activity in North America. And clearly, on the momentum of -- and it's typically -- it happens in the early part of the year before it plateaus in the second half, and that's nothing new. That's a pattern that we expect, hence it will have an impact on the first quarter. And then we see a continuation of the offshore strength and in -- be it in Gulf of Mexico, in East Canada or further North in Alaska. And this activity is set to continue to grow in 2023.  So NAm will be indeed an engine that will support growth in the first half. And by contrast, as I said, the usual pattern of seasonality internationally in the Northern Hemisphere will be offsetting this. And we will also, this year, have the effect of the Russia year-on-year decline that we expect to impact negatively. So you have a mix there that I think we have described. And -- but NAm will be an engine of growth in the second -- the first half. Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan Chase. I wanted to get your thoughts, Olivier, on the level of service intensity that you're seeing, particularly in the Middle East, perhaps relative to the 2009, '14 cycle, as well as thoughts on the spare -- OFS capacity in markets like the Middle East and offshore. Yes. I think let me reflect first on the -- indeed, the service intensity. I think the -- again, as I said, I think there is a significant expansion happening at the same time concurrently. And there is a significant focus on performance. So this has led to an increase of service intensity in the contract where we operate. We are fully participating to this, and we are leading on many of them based on our performance.  But at the same time, we have much increased and much improved asset efficiency. And hence, we are able to deliver that service intensity, that performance-focused delivery to our customer without increasing our CapEx intensity. And we remain with our target of 5% to 7% total CapEx, as you have seen in our guidance today. So that's -- I think that's one aspect that I think is critical. And we use that discipline in our CapEx, that capital stewardship, to indeed use this to help us extract and guide further up, the pricing in the market.  So the pricing is driven by, first and foremost, performance. As we see it, our performance gives us a premium. Technology, a unique technology that either impacting performance or impacting decarbonization as transition technology, or that is fit for the basin. And then obviously, the stretch in the capacity market that is now being obvious and is being tested in Middle East and in offshore, is driving another undercurrent of pricing positive trends. Great. And just, I want to follow up on this -- on performance. Olivier, how are your key, call it, NOC partners, differentiated in between performance and, call it, the lowest-cost bid in terms of tender awards? Are you seeing more direct awards? But how is this -- how are the tendering process being impacted by this focus on performance? I think it has been a significant impact. I think if you look at the Kimberlite survey that has been just published, I think we remained the best performance supplier, as indicated by the total survey, based on technology, based on the delivery, service quality and operational efficiency that we deliver. And I think this is recognized. This is leading to either of 2 things: I would say, direct awards or -- and ability to negotiate premium on our service pricing or technology pricing to reflect our differentiation in performance.  So the industry is measured by performance. And we believe that we have set the benchmark, and we continue to pursue collectively in our organization, through technology, through a process in operational efficiency, through digital operation, so that we can extract this performance and offer it to the customer, and they recognize it and they give you the premium. Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. You guys posted some pretty impressive margins in North America last year. Do you think most of the margin benefit overall and the share gain benefit within drilling services from your new strategy has now been captured? Because it does appear that the market is going to stagnate here onshore for a period. I'm just curious about your ability to potentially still deliver exit-to-exit growth onshore in North America. Or whether the benefits, from a share perspective and from a margin perspective, had largely been captured. No. I believe that the market has still room to grow. I believe first, from the activity, as I described, albeit I think it's very well known that the limited access to the Tier 1 inventory and acreage and the stretch on capacity in the market has created a negative inflection onto the well productivity. But we expect the major -- the public to this extent, and much less the private, to drive the growth this year.  In this market, we are well positioned because we have a technology access model and fit-for-basin technology that has, in drilling onshore, made a performance impact and has been recognized, hence has earned a premium.  We have a production portfolio -- production system portfolio that is set also through our ESP or frac trees to succeed. So we see further runway, both in growth and in margin expansion, as the market is still stretched. And similar to international market, the market recognize the opportunity to differentiate to performance, particularly the public company.  So our view is that in the North America, both land and offshore, there is not only activity-based growth coming this year, not to the same magnitude in land market like last year. And still support also pricing, considering the stretch and considering the recognized premium on fit technology and on performance. And part -- and this is true both on land and on offshore environment. Great. No, I appreciate all that color. And then just turning to Russia, you mentioned that Russian activity will be trending lower in '23. Is that a market comment? Or does that apply to your activity in the country as well? No. That's -- I think we are clear, that's a market comment directionally and in line with some independent market analysts' view. This is 5 to -- or single-digit to teens digit decline, and we align with this view. And I think our market activity will decline accordingly. From the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. I'd just like -- I'd like to come back to your positive commentary on the increase in the offshore, and particularly deepwater. I was just curious, to the extent you can share it with us, kind of the way to think about the impact on Schlumberger -- excuse me, SLB, as we go from kind of a conventional land rig, an international land rig, shallow water and then deepwater, right? Like so what's the sort of multiple of revenues, potential margin expansion as you go across those? Yes. I think we have commented this before, and we have commented that offshore is an intensity of 5x revenue intensity per rig. And we maintain that view, whether this can expand depending on the intensity, depending on the market mix, depending on the pricing, I think, is, I would say, a floor to some extent.  But yes, we see the deepwater accelerating. And I think it's something that is not only in one region, but I think it's pretty broad. As I commented, it's Latin America, it's Africa, it's East Med and is to some extent also East Asia. Hence, this addition.  I mean, we're not talking about necessarily 50 rigs, but 1 and 2s and 3s rigs in those regions. And the fact that they are relating to also a content of exploration and appraisal is creating a mix that is favorable in the quarters to come, I will say. Okay. And then my unrelated follow-up is to come back on the CapEx. Understand '22 running a little hot and the growth rate a little slower in '23, based on that accelerated CapEx. But what's the right way for us to think about CapEx as a percent of revenue? Because for a bit, it seemed like kind of 5% to 6%, running a little above that in '22. And by my own calculations, maybe still running above that in '23. So I just wondered if there's been a change in how you're thinking about it, or it just reflects market conditions as we look into '23 and the middle of the decade. I think you clearly have to distinguish the CapEx portion which is directly correlated to the level of activity and the APS investments. So together, as we guided, this is a total envelope for 2023 of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.  Within this, the CapEx portion, as we said, we will continue to target a range of 5% to 7% of revenue. So it allows us to flex it based on activity, but we will not go above this, and it will be probably pretty similar to the percentage we saw in 2022. Okay. Great. So no change in how you're thinking about the investments and how that affects return on capital employed and everything going forward. No, no, not at all. It's in still the same target range. And our next question is from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Olivier, you've outlined '23 international growth, and at your investor event kind of give us some parameters around '25. But then your comments today about international growth could keep going through '27 and possibly to 2030. I think we're all pretty familiar with Middle East, strong growth. Offshore as well growing substantially. But what do you see as some kind of the later-cycle growers? Or is this cycle mainly Middle East and offshore? Yes, I think, again, to make sure we are clear on the commentary we have shared. I think I was specific about the later part of the year, the '27 to 2030, all capacity and gas development commitments in the Middle East, okay? Offshore, similarly, I think it's a typical development and FID that are being blessed and sanctioned this year and years to come, have a 3 to 5 years horizon. So combining the -- what is expected to be the FID and dollar value in offshore environment in 2023 in the last 10 years with a pipeline that is still strong going forward, we indeed expect 3 to 5 years fall through on offshore from today.  And combining with Middle East, the rest, I think, is more related to short cycle and is difficult to combine. But I think these 2 major growth engine internationally, I think, have the potential to sustain a very resilient growth of international environment for years to come. Indeed, that's correct. And that's our opportunity at this point. Next, we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. So Olivier, I wanted to kind of follow up as you kind of laid out your financial targets back from your Analyst Day in November, and it looks like you're very much on track to kind of meeting those targets. And I just want to get a sense now as we're kind of entering into 2023, are you getting a feeling that the market momentum in both international and offshore is even better than you thought it was when you laid out your plans on the Analyst Day in November? No, I think generally speaking, I think, directionally, I think the market assumption we took, the macro backdrop we anticipated, are roughly the same. I think I will only put 2 comments. I think first is that the dynamic of this year has, as I commented in my remarks, a little bit of an upside, depending on the China economic rebound and opening. And that could lead later in the year to up cycle and FID acceleration. And that will have an uptick on the year outlook.  And secondly, I think the -- and I think building on the recent visit I had in the Middle East and the engagement I had with a lot of customers there, I think the strength of the -- and commitment to this capacity expansion and to this gas development program I think is here to stay, and will be resilient to your market condition, I would say.  So I believe that the duration of the cycle. I think we limited our guidance to 2025, but it's obvious -- becoming increasing obvious, that this cycle will expand and we'll have the strength to expand growth beyond '25, both on offshore and Middle East growth engine that will materialize. Okay. That's great color. And then a lot of great information around your Core businesses. Just kind of curious now, what -- if you could give us a brief outlook on what's happening on the New Energy side. No. I think New Energy, I'm very pleased with the progress. I think we crystallized our strategy very much in the last 6 months. I think we have been commenting on it extensively during the Capital Market Day to outline the 5 selected domains in which we are investing in technology. We're investing in partnership. We're investing into equity and critical partner to accelerate our go-to-market, to accelerate our success.  So continue to make progress on each of these 5 domains. And we have seen some announcements relating to CCUS, which I believe has a lot of momentum, and we are involved into dozens of projects this year. And we have crystallized and materialized some partnership, including the partnership with Linde for blue ammonia, blue hydrogen and gas processing. And we have been investing in that area as well for carbon capture. And we continue to make progress, and you have seen some announcement on geoenergy with Celsius, which is a very critical technology that is being assessed and being recognized in Europe as something that could really have an impact as a new technology, as a new domain that could transform a little bit the way the heating and cooling of buildings and cities are done.  So we have a great long-term outlook on this, and more will come on this chapter. But in general, we are making progress on each of this domain, be it in pilots, be it in early commercial contracts, be it in technology milestones. We'll continue to inform you on these milestones so that you can judge the progress and continue to assess the potential.  And then keep us -- we will keep you informed on our journey towards 2030 and the mission we have to the next decade. So I'm still positive and encouraged -- continue be encouraged with what the feedback we're getting from our partners and from our customers.  Thank you. Thank you very much. So it's time to conclude. So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with 4 key takeaways.  First, our 2022 results represent another positive step in our financial and operational performance journey. Financially, we realized broad revenue growth and margin expansion, closed the fourth quarter with year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion ahead of our initial guidance and further reduced net debt. Operationally, the year was transformative, as we executed our strategy across 3 engine of growth and communicate our new brand purpose and identity. This firmly positions SLB to be the leader in the energy sector across multiple opportunities and time horizons.  Second, the macroeconomic environment remains highly supportive of multiyear up cycle in both oil and gas and low-carbon energy solutions. This is fundamentally driven by demand growth amidst very tight supply and further boosted by the prioritization of energy security and Decarbonization. These market conditions will continue to support steady growth in global oil and gas upstream investment for years to come and will prompt additional investments in low carbon energy solutions for a balanced planet.  Third, the oil and gas industry is entering a new phase in the up cycle marked by the inflection in the Middle East and the strengthening of offshore activity. Taken together, this signals the onset of a new growth pattern internationally. These dynamics are closely aligned with our strengths and will enable us to benefit from a favorable pricing environment and further technology adoption. Additionally, we believe that the secular trends in digital transformation and decarbonization will only accelerate across all markets, presenting an advantaged position for SLB.  Finally, based on our confidence in the strength of the up cycle, our favorable market exposure and strong financial results, we reaffirm our ambition to significantly expand shareholders' returns in 2023 through a commitment to more than double the returns when compared to 2022 through a combination of increased dividends and share buybacks.  I could not be more satisfied with SLB's position at the onset of 2023, and have full confidence in our team's ability to fully seize the new phase of this sub cycle and accelerate our investment for the future. We look forward to once again exceeding your expectation throughout this year.  Thank you very much for your time. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day, everyone. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer. Thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our terrific fourth quarter results rounded out another great year for Danaher. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove nearly 10% core growth, strong earnings growth and free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits for the year and has now grown high single digits or better each of the last 10 quarters.  Our well-rounded results this year would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 80,000 associates. The team overcame global supply chain challenges, logistics delays, COVID-driven lockdowns and inflationary pressures to reliably support our customers. We believe the DBS-driven execution, coupled with our proactive growth investments over the last several years, contributed to meaningful market share gains in many of our businesses.   Now looking to 2023 and beyond, we see a bright future ahead for Danaher. Our portfolio is made up of leading franchises of durable business models and attractive end markets that benefit from outstanding long-term secular growth drivers. We're well positioned financially with our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet capacity, allowing us to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. So this unique combination of leading businesses and financial strength, all powered by the Danaher Business System, differentiates us and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage.   So with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2022 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth, including 8% core revenue growth in our base business. We also expanded our core operating margins by 60 basis points and generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio exceeded 100% for the 31st consecutive year.   Now our strong financial results allowed us to continue our cadence of high-impact growth investments throughout the year. In fact, our investments in research and development of more than $1.7 billion in 2022 enabled us to accelerate innovation across Danaher. New products such as the Leica Microsystems' Mica; Leica Biosystems' automated advanced staining platform, BOND-PRIME; and Hach's HQ Series portable meters are helping improve both human health and the environment while enhancing our growth trajectory.   Our capital expenditures of over $1 billion included substantial investments to expand production capacity in our bioprocessing and genomics businesses. These investments have been critical to support current customer demand. But they're equally important to support the long-term growth opportunities and security of supply in these markets. With several of our customers' biologic therapies progressing through the regulatory approval process, we anticipate the size of our bioprocessing and genomics businesses to increase meaningfully here in the coming years.   Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Sales were $8.4 billion. And we delivered 7.5% core revenue growth. Our base business core revenue growth was also 7.5% as our core revenue growth contribution from COVID-19 testing was neutral year-over-year. Geographically, core revenue growth in both North America and Western Europe was approximately 10%. We saw healthy demand across our major end markets with customer activity and funding levels largely consistent with the third quarter.  High-growth markets core revenue was up slightly. China grew low single digits, driven by robust demand in our Life Sciences instruments and acute care diagnostic businesses. However, the reopening efforts associated with the ending of zero-COVID policies and subsequent increase in COVID-19 infections resulted in reduced patients and testing volumes in our clinical diagnostics business. We anticipate lower testing volumes to continue through the first quarter of 2023 before gradually recovering through the balance of the year.   Our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 59%. And our operating margin of 27.4% was up 100 basis points, including 105 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This strong margin performance was enabled by the disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions our teams implemented to help offset the impact of inflationary pressures across our business.  While there continued to be supply chain disruptions and cost pressures, we saw a modest improvement in component availability again this year and this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.87 was up 6.5% versus last year. And we also generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.   Now before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to point out some updates we've made in our financial reporting. Due to changes in our organization resulting from the significant growth of our Life Sciences segment over the past several years, we have separated our former Life Science segment into two new reporting segments.  Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences, which include bioprocessing and our discovery and medical businesses, are now reported as the Biotechnology segment. Our new Life Sciences segment is comprised of the remainder of the businesses in our former Life Sciences segment. The Diagnostics and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments are unchanged. Now importantly, today's discussion reflects these changes.   So now let's take a look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 1% and core revenue was up 4%. In bioprocessing, robust customer activity across monoclonal antibodies, cell and gene therapies and antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, drove another quarter of more than 20% growth in non-COVID revenue.  Total core growth in bioprocessing was mid-single digits for the fourth quarter as customers continued to scale back their COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs. For the full year 2022, core revenue growth in bioprocessing was high single digits, which included non-COVID revenue growth of more than 20%.   Looking to 2023, we expect customers to further reduce their COVID-19-related programs. Vaccination and booster rates have been significantly lower than initially anticipated. And the availability of alternative therapeutics has reduced the need for monoclonal antibody-based treatments. In light of these dynamics, we now anticipate COVID-19-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue will be approximately $150 million for the full year of 2023, down from approximately $800 million in 2022 and lower than our previous expectation of $500 million.   Our non-COVID business has averaged more than 20% growth over the past 2 years. Given these elevated growth rates, we spent the past several weeks speaking with our customers to better understand their planning assumptions for 2023. And based on these discussions, we anticipate non-COVID bioprocessing core growth will be high single digits for the full year 2023. This includes low single-digit core growth in the first quarter as customers repurpose inventory purchased for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs to non-COVID projects.   Now there is a bright future ahead for the biologics market and our leading bioprocessing business. A number of biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise. And we expect to see significant industry-wide investments in research, development and production capacity well into the future. With our differentiated portfolio, which is the broadest and deepest in the industry across upstream and downstream applications, our best-in-class scientific services and extensive global reach, we're exceptionally well positioned to support our customers as they undertake this complex life-changing work.   Now moving to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 8% and core revenue was up 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments and consumables with all major businesses delivering high single digits or better core revenue growth. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Demand remains solid across our major geographies and end markets. And we're seeing good momentum in our opportunity funnels as we begin the new year.   Our genomics consumables businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, driven by strong demand for our plasmas, RNA and gene lighting and editing solutions. During the quarter, IDT strengthened its next-generation sequencing portfolio with the acquisition of ArcherDX NGS assays. These assays are foundational in researching novel cancer fusions and bring new capabilities, including an enhanced bioinformatics platform to expand IDT's suite of sequencing solutions.   Now moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 3% and core revenue grew 7.5%, led by mid-teens growth at Cepheid. Radiometer grew double digits, led primarily by demand for blood gas testing in China. Leica Biosystems was also up double digits with growth across all major product lines. In our digital pathology business, we saw record placements of the GT 450, Leica's best-in-class digital pathology slide scanner, as customers are increasingly realizing the operational and clinical benefits of digitization.   In molecular diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu grew more than 20%, led by infectious disease testing, sexual health and hospital-acquired infections. The acceleration in growth this quarter was due in part to increased adoption of Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu across our nearly 50,000 instruments installed base, which has doubled since 2020.   During the quarter, Cepheid expanded their competitively advantaged test menu with the launch of the Xpert Xpress MVP. The Xpress MVP rapidly diagnoses three distinct health conditions that cause overlapping vaginitis symptoms in women using a single sample. This addition to our sexual health portfolio enables physicians to quickly diagnose a patient's infection and prescribe a targeted treatment regimen, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing closer to patients is improving health care outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid.   In respiratory testing, global PCR testing volumes continued to moderate. But demand for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR testing remained robust. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter significantly exceeded our expectation of approximately $375 million. The respiratory season got off to an earlier-than-anticipated start with a high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, notably COVID-19, flu and RSV, leading to both higher volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV.  Now based on discussions with our customers, we believe COVID-19 will enter an endemic disease state in 2023, and as a result, expect to ship 30 million respiratory tests and generate $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year. As hospitals and health systems begin planning for their endemic testing needs, we're increasingly seeing customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms on to Cepheid's GeneXpert.  Our customers' preference for the GeneXpert for both respiratory and nonrespiratory testing is a result of the significant value of the unique combination of fast, accurate, lab-quality results and a best-in-class workflow-provided clinicians. The combination of these advantages, the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market and our leading global installed base create significant opportunities ahead for Cepheid's point-of-care solutions.   Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 1% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Water quality core revenue growth was high single digits and product identification was flat. At product identification, marking and coding was up slightly while packaging and color management was down low single digits. Core revenue at Videojet was up slightly due in part to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q4 last year.   In December, Pantone announced Viva Magenta as the 2023 Color of the Year. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit full year core revenue growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2022.  In water quality, Hach delivered their third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. ChemTreat was also up double digits in the fourth quarter, capping its 54th consecutive year of growth, a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class execution and their commitment to continuous improvement. During the quarter, demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remained strong across municipal and industrial end markets. But we did see a slight moderation of larger project activity at Trojan.   Throughout the year, our teams in EAS did a great job leveraging the Danaher Business System to overcome supply chain challenges and manage inflationary pressures. They were at the forefront of identifying potential constraints and quickly deployed DBS tools, like daily management, to work with suppliers and ensure production parts availability. They also used visual project management to rapidly reengineer products and to reduce our reliance on hard-to-source electronic components.  Also, strong price performance helped the team expand operating profit margins by more than 80 basis points in 2022 while continuing their cadence of growth investments. We believe this outstanding execution, paired with our proactive growth investments, drove market share gains and enhanced our long-term competitive advantage in both product identification and water quality.   So with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and the full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we are updating our base business core revenue growth definition to exclude the impact of COVID-19-related testing and the impact of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue.  In the first quarter, we expect core revenue growth in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%.   Now for the full year 2023. We expect high single-digit core growth in our base business. And we also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 31%.   So to wrap up, 2022 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to reliably support our customers and deliver outstanding financial results, all while investing for the future. As we look ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, the differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, position Danaher to outperform well into the future.   So with that, I'll turn the call back over to John. Thanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Todd, we're now ready to open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. So a couple of questions to start. I guess, the first one would be just on the inventory situation and sort of like how we should think about that working through and just sort of your expectations on the bioprocessing front on the non-COVID bioprocessing, just some sense of timing. Is this a 1Q, 2Q phenomenon? Just general thoughts there. Derik, as it relates to the inventory situation, let's think about sort of our Q1 guide here as a starting point and the context for that. We expect for our overall guide to have a base business growth of mid-single digits. And we expect COVID testing, including now vaccine and therapeutics, to have high single-digit and low double-digit headwind, giving us that decline of mid-single digits in the first quarter.  Now let me come back to the base business because, of course, that's where your question resides. And once more, we have to be clear that we have now excluded vaccine and therapeutic revenues from the base business, right? So our mid-single-digit base business is down from the comparable low double-digit core growth we saw in Q4 and most of 2022. And that's due mainly to bioprocessing ex COVID. And I want to dig into that a little bit, but also because we're expecting lower patient volumes here in China as zero-COVID policies are ended. So that's what's happening there in that base business in Q1.  Now if we look and we dig in a little bit deeper into bioprocessing, we anticipate that our non-COVID bioprocessing business will be low single digits. And that's really for two reasons. One, we're coming off of 30% growth in Q1 of 2022. But we're also working through the inventory pockets that we spoke about that were related primarily to COVID programs. And we do expect Q1 to be an inflection point there that we work through the majority of that in Q1 and then after that, continue to see improvement. Got it. Okay. And I have to ask the obligatory analytical instrumentation demand, SCIEX demand, coming off of some really strong growth this year. What are your sort of expectations on instruments? And I would expect you would see some slowdown in the back half of the year is embedded in your numbers? I think that reflects our perspective. We saw low double-digit-plus core growth in our instrument businesses here in 2022 and believe that we definitely took share there. And frankly, our funnels are still very strong here going into the new year. But as we look to the total year, we would expect that low double-digit-plus to moderate to the more normal growth of mid-single-digit-plus certainly towards the back end of the year. And what's embedded in sort of like an overall pricing expectation, just  to get a sense of... So as you know, we -- in the fourth quarter on pricing, Derik, we came in over 400 basis points with the teams really executing very well. And that represents roughly where we were for all of 2022. As we look forward then into 2023, we continue to expect some cost pressures there. And we'll look to have pricing of 200 to 300 basis points, probably closer to 300 basis points. Derik, that's for total Danaher, not just instruments. Yes, okay. Got it. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. So first up, just on China, so you mentioned that you're expecting some softness there. Can you just dig a little bit deeper, how much of the softness on that 1Q is going to be pressured there? And then what do you expect for China in total for the year as well? So as I mentioned, China is -- and of course, everybody knows coming out of the zero-COVID lockdowns, and that's affecting patient volumes here. And we saw that in December, in particular, and have taken that as an indicator for how we should think about the first quarter in China, which we expect to be down around high single digits here in the first quarter but then moderating as the Chinese population gets through sort of the various infection waves that are expected. And we expect that patient volumes then improve throughout the year and are expecting low single digits for the full year in China. Great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, you mentioned that Western Europe was 10% core during the 4Q. Can you just talk about your expectations for Europe with this year? Have you seen any softness related to any budget constraints on your conversations with customers there? I would tell you, if we think about non-COVID, we continue to see good demand in Western Europe. We have seen the cycle time of deals, so that period of time between lead, capture and capturing the order, extending here in the fourth quarter. And we would expect that to continue. As you think about Western Europe, including COVID headwinds, we would expect that to be flat here in the first quarter and then up low single digits. But once again, that includes some COVID headwinds. Helpful. And then final question for me, just around bioprocessing. Can you just walk us through kind of the order book and how book-to-bill has trended within bioprocessing, given some of the puts and takes there getting us to that low single digits in the first quarter and rounding out the year at high single digits on the non-COVID side? Sure. So as it relates to orders, and I talked about this in the past, as well as book-to-bill. In fact, we don't really look at book-to-bill for the bioprocessing business because it may not be the best way. And we don't think it is the best way to really understand the underlying health of the business, particularly given the extended lead times that we had here in the prior period. So we've been looking at orders really on a 2- to 3-year horizon to take out the lumpiness as well as the extended lead times. And over the last 3 years, really both orders and revenues have grown at a mid-single-teens average rate.  Now from a current trend perspective, in the fourth quarter, our order rate improved by over 500 basis points sequentially but was still down mid-teens, which was as expected as customers continued to adjust for our shorter lead times. Now to be clear, our full year 2023 guide anticipates Q1 being the low point at low single digits for the bioprocessing non-COVID core growth. And that also takes account to any inventories that might be with some of our COVID program customers, which are now being repurposed. We're working with those customers to repurpose that inventory. So whatever these order dynamics, our revenue forecast for bioprocessing non-COVID in the first quarter is low single digits. We expect that to be the low point of the inventory work-off or burn-off and then move forward to what is high single-digit bioprocessing non-COVID core growth for the full year. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. So I had my first question on bioprocessing here, just to clarify some of these numbers here. I think a couple of months ago, Rainer, I think the expectation was for base bioprocessing anywhere from high singles to teens. When you look at the high singles, it's a bit at the low end of that range. Did anything change? And when I think about the cadence throughout the year, I think first half is somewhere in the mid-single digits, implies second half in double-digit range. Is there any risk out there in the back half? What gives you the visibility in the back half ex COVID and bioprocessing? Thanks, Vijay. So as early as the JPMorgan conference, we did talk about the bioprocessing growth range being from high single digits to mid-teens range. And as I mentioned then, and I'll confirm now, we have spent the last several weeks talking to our customers to understand their planning assumptions for the year. And the clear message is the underlying demand remains robust and unchanged. So we continue to see monoclonal antibodies, cell therapy and gene therapy activity continue to be strong. And we're even seeing more work on mRNA on the back of its success with COVID vaccines. So while the demand is remaining solid, customers are actually not anticipating a step-up in activity.  So activity remains strong and as we've seen in prior quarters. But they're not anticipating a step-up versus what we've seen here in the last couple of years. And so as you look at the 2-, 3-, even 4-year stacks here, we've seen mid-teens growth CAGRs for bioprocessing non-COVID. So coming back then, if you take our high single-digit bioprocessing non-COVID full year guide on the back of an approximately 30% comp from 2022, it fits right in the mid-teens range, both on a 2- and a 3-year basis. So we think that's especially strong in light of the fact that in Q1, we do expect to burn off some inventory and will start low single digits.  And in fact, if we had assumed the mid-teens to the higher part of the range for '23, that actually would have implied an acceleration of demand to over 20% on a 2-year stack. And frankly, that's just not supported by our customer discussions. So as we think about burning off these inventories, you asked about the confidence in the later part of the year. And that confidence is based on our discussions with customers, the backlog that we have, the continued order activity that we see and that has improved over prior periods. And so we feel very good about the high single digits non-COVID bioprocessing growth for 2023. And maybe, Vijay, just to give you a bit -- sorry, yes, just to give you kind of numbers to it. Because I know we've talked about this a lot recently, but just so that we kind of repeated here. If you look at bioprocessing ex COVID growth, right, over the last 4 years, inclusive of our '23 guide, you have 7%, 8%-type growth in 2020 as we are sort of moving into and away from the core bioprocess of doing more COVID work. And then in 2021 and 2022, we grew ex COVID 20%-plus in each of those 2 years. And so now this year in '23, the high single-digit guide, it's sort of kind of an inverse barbell, if you will.  But if you look at kind of high single digits to start in '20, high single digits as we get through the last of COVID in '23 with 20% and 25% growth in the middle in '21 and '22, that's sort of the period that we're looking back and over. Because I don't think you can look at just any 1 period or quarter, given everything Rainer said that happened in '21 and '22 with the extended lead times and what was happening with COVID. So just so that we're all on the same page on sort of the numbers historically on how we have sort of arrived at that mid-teens growth rate in discussion with our customers who say, \"Hey, look, if you look back over the last 3, 4 years, my demand is about the same. My order pattern is going to be slightly different. But my end demand is about the same.\" That's helpful color and perspective. And then one last question here for me. Perhaps, Matt, this is for you. The high single-digit guide for bioprocessing implies like the non-bioprocessing that's nearly 75% of Danaher revenues. That's also up high singles. That's a strong number. Again, any confidence here?  I think there's been some concerns around capital order trends. So what's the order book shaping up for instruments? And margins here, 31%, that's stepped down from Q4. Given that high single digits will resume and the pricing commentary, your volume leverage and pricing contribution should be pretty strong. So maybe if you could just comment on the non-bioprocessing high single-digit assumptions and margin assumptions? Well, let me take margins. And I think we sort of covered the high single digits bit. But maybe Rainer can kind of wrap it up on bioprocessing. I'm sorry, non-bioprocessing. Non-bioprocessing. I'm sorry. So COVID? No, no, no, ex bioprocessing, the other, EAS diagnostics. I meant those... I'm sorry. Okay. Everything outside of bioprocessing, got you. So let me start with the margin question first because I think that's one that's topical here, too. So if you think about margins for the full year, and then I can kind of touch on '21 -- or Q1 as well, if you look at margins, we're talking about kind of 31% adjusted margin. And that's going to be a bit lower than we were in '23 on the margin, if you will, with the biggest factor going to be the volume leverage, like you alluded to there. We're going to lose, call it, $3.2 billion of COVID headwinds in the year, $700 million from the vaccines and therapeutics as we go from, call it, $800 million to a little over $150 million or a little under $150 million. And then we're going to have $2.5 billion of testing follow-up as we think we get to a more endemic state on Cepheid testing.  So the margin profile on that stuff on the headwinds is basically the fleet average. I'd say that probably falls through at 40%, so kind of in line with our normal fall through. But that volume is pretty meaningful at $3.2 billion as you talked about. So we will offset some of that. High single-digit core and the base business is going to be $1.7 billion and change, let's call it, falling through 35% to 40%, but just not enough to fully compensate what's happening with our COVID headwinds here. So I think you combine that, the volume, with sort of an overall macro backdrop, Vijay, that I still want to kind of be prudent here from a planning perspective as we head into the year. I want to see how the inflation of the supply chain kind of progresses through the year.  China is still a bit of an unknown on how that bounces back. And I kind of -- I like to start the year with a cost structure that's in the right place. And let's see how some of these things sort of play out. And as the year goes on, we'll obviously try to do better. But that's sort of how I'm kind of thinking about the margin for the year. And really, the only difference between Q1 and Q2 from 31% for the full year -- and sorry, in Q1 is FX in the first quarter. That's it. We'll have a $225 million FX headwind in Q1. And so I would say that the same drivers, if you will, for the full year are for Q1. And then Vijay, just coming back to your question regarding the base business without Biotechnology growth here for 2023. We talked about Life Sciences instruments going from the low double digits or to the mid-single-digit-plus here as we expect that to moderate during the course of the year. But in our Life Science businesses, we also have our genomics businesses, which are growing at double digits. So when you look at our, under the new definition, Life Sciences business, so that would be the instrument businesses and genomics businesses, we expect high single-digit growth for the year.  As it relates to our Diagnostics business without COVID testing, we also expect high single-digit growth there, if you think about the growth in Leica Biosystems, Radiometer and as patient volumes normalize, supported also by solid growth at Beckman, Diagnostics, once again without COVID testing, high single digits. And then as it relates to EAS, we would expect that now to normalize after having had just banner growth here in the last couple of years to be more the low to mid-single-digit growth, probably skewed more to mid-single digits for the year. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Lots of detail already discussed here. So I'll try to go back to a little bigger picture. What assumptions are you guys using for kind of labor and material inflation for 2023? I assume this is mitigated a little bit from the high labor inflation you've had the last couple of years. But curious on your view there. Yes, Scott. I think when I think about price/cost kind of back to that 200 to 300 basis points of price, we have been positive on price/cost the last, I guess, year here and probably a little bit more. So I think we -- that guide of 200 to 300 basis points would keep us at positive price/cost. We are seeing -- I would say that we're seeing some things from a supply chain pressure come down.  Freight rates is probably the one -- the biggest one that I can think of from a cost perspective. I would tell you that other parts of the supply chain, we probably are seeing availability be better but not necessarily seeing costs come down yet. So I think we're sort of still in that 200 to 300 basis points of price to help offset what is still out there. But there are early signs of things may be turning. Is that price, Matt, is that pretty much already out in the system? Or is that still to be... No, it's out. Yes, it's already out there. And if we need to, we can go for more as we've done here, Scott. And you saw that as we built through the year this year. And can you guys remind us what are the remaining steps you need for the EAS separation? Is there any kind of upside to getting that done on the early -- earlier than planned? I'd love to say that it's easy to do. But there's quite a bit of work to get through it, Scott. I mean, we've got -- we're still in the early days of the audits, getting the audits done. And after that, we've got a lot of org work obviously to do and a whole work stream of people who are working on it. I think we are still very much on track for Q4, the ability to do something here in Q4. Anything earlier, I think just between the audits, the work that remains and the tax ruling, it just takes time for these. So I don't think that's probably a base case scenario for us right now, Scott. I still think Q4 is the way to think about it. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Maybe first one would just be on China. I know there was a question asked earlier. But just wondering, some peers have commented that obviously there's a headwind right now as the COVID rates have spiked. But that, as the year plays out, you could see China actually turn out to be stronger than maybe you were -- or than peers were anticipating, excuse me, given the benefits on the economy. So kind of what are you assuming in that low single? Is that -- do you think you're leaving some cushion in there? Or just how do you contemplate China playing out for the year, given the change in policy? Dan, so I mean, the near term, just to recap is, in fact, that we saw, particularly in our Diagnostics business, lower patient volumes related to the hospitals in China being overwhelmed with COVID-infected patients. And we expect that to continue here in the Q1. It's currently the Lunar New Year holiday, where we expect infections to spread here in the next 30 days or so. And then over time, that, that would start waning, reducing. With -- it's kind of unknown as to how many other waves follow that.  But we do believe that during the course of the year, especially as it relates to our business, patient volumes start recovering. We've seen this again and again after severe lockdowns of large cities in the previous years. And so we expect that to be pretty resilient. And that's why we end up then with a full year China guide of low single digits. Now could there be upside? Potentially.  There's clearly some pent-up demand in the Chinese economy. And it just depends now on how quickly people can get back to work and some normalcy returns to the markets in general. So we think from where we sit today, low single digits for the full year is a good way to think about it. And of course, we'll continue to update as we go through the year here. But it's a good starting point. And there may be some upside, should in fact that pent-up demand be released here in 2023. Great. And then just on the M&A environment, we've heard some commentary in kind of recent weeks that there seems to be a more willing seller environment, maybe just a reflection of macro and interest rates. So there seems to be maybe more folks coming to the table. How would you characterize -- obviously, it's impossible to time M&A. But how would you characterize the current environment?  And just any color in terms of the outlook, whether it be from private targets or public targets? And obviously, I'm sure all the remaining businesses post the EAS spin are candidates for M&A. But just how would you characterize kind of the interest levels by your business? So our perspective on M&A remains unchanged here. First of all, our funnels continue to be very active. As you know, our balance sheet, which is now at 1.5 turns, is in great shape. We're starting to see in the marketplace some recognition, and I'll even say some acceptance of the lower valuation levels that we have now seen for a good period of time. And I would say it is early days, but the environment for M&A continues to improve. And as you know, in the past, when there have been these kind of situations, Danaher has been able to deploy capital in a really value-creating way. And of course, it's our intention to do that here in the future as well. Our next question -- I'm sorry, our last question will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Maybe one on -- back to the Diagnostics business. On Cepheid, can you just talk about the non-COVID piece, what you're hearing from customers in terms of utilization, usage, particularly those who bought instruments during COVID? Obviously, you saw the installed base double over a couple of years there, would love just some perspective in terms of what you're seeing as COVID comes down a bit, respiratory comes down here shortly, what the expectations there. I mean, Patrick, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing. As you mentioned, over 50,000 instruments placed, more than double than we've had, well into the mid-20s in the number of tests. Now as you can imagine here in the fourth quarter and sort of the beginning of the first quarter, our customers have been busy with respiratory testing, no question about that. But we're very encouraged by the fact that even in the fourth quarter, we saw that non-COVID testing growing at over 20%. And I think that's indicative of a couple of things.  First of all, we were very strategic in how we thought about placing our instruments in the sense that we really stayed at the point of care with customers that would be able to standardize their larger IDNs around the GeneXpert architecture as well as leverage subsequent to the pandemic the broad testing menu that we offer. And we continue to see that. Not only do we continue to see that, but we see continued consolidation of point-of-care molecular testing onto the GeneXpert platform, which is likely also another driver for us seeing the continued adoption of the nonrespiratory menu. So very positive outlook here, we're encouraged, and it's still kind of early days. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just to follow up on Dan's capital deployment one there, can you just refresh us on kind of how you think about leverage ratios and if the current rate environment changes your perspective at all in terms of what size of deal you guys would look at? Yes, Dan -- or Patrick. Yes, I mean, from a leverage perspective, we've been -- I think, a couple of times in our history, we got to a little bit over 4. So I mean, I think we've always said we don't have much of an appetite to be rated any lower than we are, for sure. So I think that's sort of the outer boundaries of what to kind of think about. But we kind of -- we've been all over the place historically. We don't really have a target of 2 or 3. It just sort of moves around with the deal activity. And we sort of take our time, too.  And as far as the current rate environment, I don't think it changes anything for us. I think we still think about sort of returns in the same way that we did. We've been doing this a long time. We've been in rate environments like this before. We've been in the rate environments that are worse last 10 or 12 years, obviously at close to zero was a very different time. But I don't think we have fundamentally any changes here, given where we're at. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks. Well, first of all, thanks again, everybody. We are thrilled with the way we closed out 2022. And we see a strong 2023 ahead. With all the numbers, maybe just a quick recap.  For 2023, we see our base business growing at high single digits. And in the first quarter, we see that base business, despite the fact that we're working off some biotech and bioprocessing inventories, at mid-single digits. Now we've talked at length about COVID testing and vaccine, therapeutic headwinds. And I think those are real. But despite those headwinds, we feel great about the important role that we played in the pandemic.  Keep in mind, we have reinvested COVID-related cash flows to create lasting annuities with acquisitions and breakthrough innovation while further strengthening our balance sheet. And so we exit the pandemic much stronger than we entered with higher growth and higher margins in our base business. So with that, we thank you for the call. Wish you all the best for 2023. Thanks, everybody. We're around for follow-ups all day. Thanks. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Technologies Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Latif, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.   On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Calio, Chief Operating Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from Raytheon Technologies' website at www.rtx.com.   Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustment and net nonrecurring and/or significant items often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.   Raytheon Technologies' SEC filings, including its Form 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]  With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes. Thank you, Latif, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our press release this morning.   Before we get into the highlights, I'd first like to welcome Chris Calio to the call. As you know, Chris has been our Chief Operating Officer for the last year, has been responsible for our business units as well as our operations, engineering and digital functions. Effective March 1, Chris has been elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of RTX. Chris has been instrumental over this past year in driving our focus on operational excellence and delivering for our customers in a very challenging environment. So welcome, Chris.   Okay. Let's go to the webcast slide for Slide 2. We'll talk about some of the highlights for 2022. I don't have to tell anybody that '22 was an incredibly dynamic year. And I'm pleased to say that we were able to achieve, despite facing a number of significant challenges, including transitioning out of Russia, managing record levels of inflation as well as supply chain and labor constraints.   With all that as a backdrop, we still delivered $67.1 billion in sales for the full year, which was up 6% organically and adjusted EPS of $4.78, which was up 12% year-over-year. We also returned almost $6 billion of capital to shareowners, which included $2.8 billion of share repurchases. And more importantly, even with the $1.6 billion headwind from the R&D tax legislation, we generated $4.9 billion in free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations. At the same time, we continue to position the business for sustained profitable growth.   In 2022, we captured $86 billion in new bookings, resulting in backlog growth of 12%, a book-to-bill of 1.28 and a near record backlog at the end of the year of $175 billion. Additionally, we were granted over 2,600 patents last year. This places us in the top 10 of companies in the United States for the second consecutive year. While we invested $9 billion in R&D and CapEx, this allowed us to bring new technologies to our market and drive further automation and digitization through each phase of our product lifestyle from design, through development, through manufacturing and product sustainment.   Our investment in recent awards supports our mission to create a safer and more connected world, which was especially true in 2022. Our products and technologies have been instrumental in helping the people of Ukraine defend itself. From the Stinger, Javelin and Excalibur to NASAMS and now Patriot air and missile defense system, we remain in lockstep with the U.S. government to ensure we can continue to support our allies.   On the commercial side of the business, we saw continued advancements on our path towards leading the future of sustainable aviation with the start of development flight testing of the GTF Advantage engine, which, as you know, further enhances the GTF's position as the leader in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.   Importantly, we also completed the first engine test run for our regional hybrid electric flight demonstrator. This system integrates a 1-megawatt electric motor, which was developed by Collins with a highly efficient Pratt & Whitney fuel burning engine, specifically adapted for hybrid electric operations. This new engine will reduce fuel burn and CO2 emissions by 30% compared to today's most advanced regional turboprop aircraft. These types of investments along with strong demand across both the commercial and defense end markets will position us for continued growth as we head into 2023. We're particularly proud that RTX outperformed among all companies in the Russell 1000 for local U.S. job creation in 2022. RTX leads the industry in employee giving and volunteering, which is a testament to the impact our workforce has in the communities where we work and where we live.   Before I turn it over to Chris, I just want to spend a minute to talk about the status of our integration and the next steps as we evolve as a pure-play aerospace and defense company. As you know, in 2020, we brought together 2 great companies, UTC Aerospace business and Raytheon. With combined strength, scale and capabilities that makes us uniquely equipped to innovate and deliver game-changing technologies and solutions for our customers. As we approach the third anniversary of this merger, we've accomplished many of our objectives, including exceeding our original synergy commitment, and we see even more opportunities ahead.   So today, we're starting the next step in our integration and evolution. Our plan is to streamline our structure to a customer-centric organization with 3 focus segments: Collins Aerospace, Raytheon and Pratt & Whitney. This will better align us with our customers' needs and allow us to better collaborate on next-generation technology. There's still a lot of work to be done to make this happen, but let me turn it over to Chris to give you some of the additional details of this transformation and some additional business updates. Chris? All right. Thank you, Greg. It's great to join today's call, and I'm looking forward to engaging more with everybody.   Starting here on Slide 3. Over the past year, I've been focused with our team on driving operational performance and program execution as well as identifying ways to improve our cost position and to ensure alignment between our investments and our strategic priorities.   As Greg noted, our merger integration is nearly complete, having realized gross cost synergies of $1.4 billion. And so we are now in the process of realigning RTX into 3 business units. Let me give you some additional color around our thinking on this. At its core, this move is about enabling us to better coordinate with our customers, aligning with their needs and collaborating more effectively across our businesses, all of which is feedback we've received from our customers. All of this will ultimately enhance performance, make us even more competitive and allow us to capture additional revenue synergies in areas such as connected battle space. For example, just this past year, we were awarded a phase of the JADC2 effort known as Titan, where RIS and Collins are working together to deliver this cutting-edge solution to ensure our joint forces have one common operating picture of the battle space.   Additionally, this realignment will allow us to better leverage our scale so we can optimize our footprint, improve resource allocation, and reduce costs for both RTX and our customers. Now we don't have a number for you today in terms of cost savings as we are in the early stages of that analysis. But we do believe there are additional material opportunities to be realized. Connection with this reorganization, Roy Azevedo, President of our I&S business, informed us of his plan to retire. Roy will, however, stay on as an adviser over the next several months to help us with this important transformation. Sean Mural, currently the CFO of our I&S has been acting President of I&S, effective February 1.  While organizational changes like this are never easy, we have demonstrated our ability to successfully execute on these types of initiatives in the past. And many members of the team involved in this process have experience from our recent portfolio and merger transformations. The exact timing of this change isn't final yet, the current plans to make effective during the second half of the year. Until then, we'll manage the business under our current structure. We'll provide updates on our progress over the coming months.   Before I turn it over to Neil to discuss our results for the quarter and the outlook for the year, I want to turn to Slide 4 to share some of our critical assumptions for 2023 and the areas where we're focused to ensure we execute on our commitments. As Greg mentioned earlier, customer demand for our products and services continues to grow. In Commercial Aerospace, we expect global air traffic to fully recover to 2019 levels as we exit 2023 with continued strength in the U.S. and Europe. This is pretty consistent from what we're all hearing from the airlines. And like everyone else, we're keeping a close eye on China, which historically has represented about 14% of global air traffic. Our working assumption today is that China's lifting of COVID restrictions continues to be manageable and its traffic levels will remain robust. We also assume traffic in other parts of the world remain resilient. We are, therefore, expecting commercial aftermarket revenue growth across our aerospace businesses to approach 20% in 2023.   Commercial production rates are also quickly accelerating and we expect commercial aircraft volumes will be up around 20% year-over-year.   On the defense side, our backlog is expected to continue to grow given the heightened and increasingly complex threat environment. In the U.S., we continue to see strong bipartisan support as evidenced by the adoption of the defense authorization bill and the Omnibus Appropriations bill with a budget of $858 billion, which is up about 10% from 2022.  In overseas, the EU is targeting a EUR 70 billion increase in defense spending over the next 3 years and Japan will increase their defense budget by 26% this year. Given our current backlog and this continued strength in demand, we remain extremely focused on execution, and I see 4 key actions that will position us to be successful on this front. One, we continue to grow production capacity to deliver on this backlog as we move through 2023 and '24. For example, we've made investments in key strategic locations like Asheville, North Carolina, for Turbine Airfoils, the Kinney, Texas for RF and EO/IR products in Bangalore, India to expand the Collins India manufacturing strategy. Second, we, of course, need a skilled workforce to execute our development and production programs. Labor availability remains a constraint. We've made some progress across RTX in Q4 through reduced attrition and other strategic retention and recruiting initiatives.  Third, we need to continue restoring health within our supply chain. We've actively maintained a physical presence at close to 400 supplier sites. We continue to qualify additional suppliers on key programs. We secured sources of supply for critical commodities. While we are broadly beginning to see our supply chain improve, it is not yet at the levels we need, we are assuming a recovery as we move into the back half of the year.  And lastly, we are taking a number of actions to deal with the elevated levels of inflation that everyone is experiencing. For perspective, we are expecting roughly $2 billion of labor and material inflation in 2023. And we are targeting to more than offset this headwind through higher pricing and aggressive cost reduction actions across all RTX. Some of these actions are in the category of blocking and tackling, such as continual process improvement and some are more strategic in nature, such as driving productivity through increasing the amount of connected equipment and automated factory hours. No doubt, we've got a lot of work in front of us, but I think we all believe we've got the right actions identified, and more importantly, the right team in place to do it.   So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to look at our financial results and outlook for '23. Thank you, Chris. Let's turn to Slide 5. I'm pleased to see how we finished the year where we continue to see solid growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow in the quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $18.1 billion grew 7% organically versus the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by our commercial aerospace businesses as the continued recovery in commercial air traffic more than offset the supply chain and labor challenges we saw during the year. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 was in line with our expectations and up 18%, led by the commercial aftermarket at Pratt & Collins which more than offset the impact of lower productivity in our defense businesses.   On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.96 per share and included $0.31 of acquisition accounting adjustments, restructuring and nonrecurring items. It's worth noting that both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share had a tax benefit of about $0.06 associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations, which were completed during the quarter. And finally, we had free cash flow of $3.8 billion in the quarter, bringing our total cash generation for the year to $4.9 billion which exceeded our commitment as a result of stronger collections, particularly in international areas across the portfolio.   With that, let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll get into the segment results. Starting with Collins. Collins sales were $5.7 billion in the quarter, up 15% on an adjusted basis and up 16% organically, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets.  By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 21%, driven by a 32% increase in provisioning and a 25% increase in parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 5% organically in the quarter. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%.  Commercial OE sales were up 20% versus prior year, driven principally by the continued strength in the narrow-body. Military sales were up 5%, driven primarily by improved material receipts, higher volume and new program awards. Adjusted operating profit of $743 million was up $274 million from the prior year as drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and lower R&D expense was more than offset by higher SG&A expense.   So shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $5.7 billion were up 10% on an adjusted basis and up 11% on an organic basis with commercial OE sales growth in large commercial engines in Pratt Canada as well as higher commercial aftermarket volume. Commercial OE sales were up 37%, driven by favorable volume and mix within Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses.  Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter with growth in both legacy large commercial and Pratt Canada shop visits. In the military business, sales were down 2%, driven by lower military legacy program aftermarket sales. Adjusted operating profit of $321 million was up $159 million from the prior year, driven primarily by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket, which included a favorable contract adjustment. It was partially offset by higher SG&A and R&D.   Turning now to RINS on Slide 8. Sales of $3.5 billion were down 8% versus prior year on an adjusted basis, driven by the divestiture of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021. On an organic basis, sales were down 5% versus prior year, driven by command control and communications, cyber training and services and sensing and effects.  Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $278 million was down $122 million versus prior year. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating profit was down $96 million driven primarily by unfavorable mix, lower net program efficiencies and lower volume. RIS had a $2.9 billion of bookings in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92 and a backlog of $16 billion and on a full year basis, RIS's book-to-bill was 0.96.   Turning now to Slide 9. R&D sales were $4.1 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis and up 7% organically, primarily driven by higher volume and naval power programs including SPY-6 production, higher volume and strategic missile defense, including next-generation interceptor development and higher volume and advanced technology programs.  Adjusted operating profit of $418 million was $68 million lower than the prior year, driven by unfavorable program mix and lower net program efficiencies partially offset by drop-through on higher volume. RMD's bookings in the quarter were $6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.48. And for the full year, RMD's book-to-bill was 1.37, resulting in a record backlog of $34 billion.   So with that, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the financial outlook for the year. At the RTX level, we expect full year 2023 sales of between $72 billion and $73 billion, which represents organic growth of 7% to 9% year-over-year. From an earnings perspective, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $4.90 to $5.05, up 3% to 6% year-over-year. And we expect to generate free cash flow of about $4.8 billion.  I should note, we are not assuming the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes will be repealed in our outlook. And as a result, in 2023, we'll have a cash payment of about $1.4 billion related to the current law. While there are more details on the cash flow walk in the appendix, let me share a few of the moving pieces.  First, we are expecting segment operating profit growth. Offsetting that will be increases in working capital, capital expenditures as well as a lower pension cost recovery. Additionally, we're expecting to buy back approximately $3 billion of RTX shares in 2023, of course, subject to market conditions.   Now getting into the details around the earnings per share walk. Starting at the segment level. We expect strong operating profit growth of about 20%, which results in about $0.77 of earnings per share growth at the midpoint of our outlook range. And as Chris noted earlier, this overcomes about $2 billion of material and labor inflation. And with respect to pension, although markets have improved since we spoke in October, pension will still be a substantial year-over-year headwind based on actual 2022 asset returns and where discount rates ended the year, that headwind will be about $0.22. Our tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 18% versus the 14.4% we saw in 2022, which will result in a $0.22 headwind. This change is primarily driven by benefits recorded in 2022 that likely won't repeat in 2023.   And to wrap things up, we see about $0.14 of net headwind year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest and corporate expenses, and all of this brings us to our outlook range of the $4.90 to $5.05 per share.   So with that, let's go to Slide 11 for a little more detail on the segment outlooks. At Collins, we expect full year sales to be up low double digits, primarily driven by continuation of the commercial aero recovery. Military sales at Collins are expected to be up mid-single digits for the year as well. We expect Collins adjusted operating profit to grow between $750 million and $825 million versus last year, and this is primarily driven by drop-through on commercial aftermarket, higher OE production ramp and increased defense volumes.  At Pratt & Whitney, we expect full year sales to be up low to mid-teens versus prior year, principally driven by higher OE deliveries in both Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses as well as continued growth in legacy large commercial engines, GTF aftermarket and Pratt Canada shop visits.  Military sales at Pratt are expected to be flat, driven by higher F135 sustainment volume, which will offset lower F135 material inputs. We expect Pratt's adjusted operating profit to grow between $200 million and $275 million versus last year, primarily on higher aftermarket volume, which is partially offset by a higher large commercial OE delivery impact.   Turning to RINS. We expect full year sales to be flat versus the prior year and adjusted operating profit to be up between $75 million and $125 million, driven by improved net program efficiencies. And in R&D, we expect sales to grow low to mid-single digits versus 2022 as the effects of the supply chain constraints ease in the back half of the year and for adjusted operating profit to be up between $175 million and $225 million versus prior year, driven by improved net program efficiencies, which will be partially offset by continued mix headwinds. And finally, higher intercompany activity will increase sales eliminations by about 10% year-over-year. And it's also worth noting, we've included an outlook for some of the below-the-line items and pension in the webcast appendix.   So with that, let me hand it back to Greg to wrap things up. Okay, Neil, thanks very much. So we're going to close out on Slide 12 and take a quick look at our priorities. Obviously, there's no surprises here. As we head into 2023, I would tell you the future remains bright for RTX, especially with a $175 billion backlog and strong demand in all of our end markets. We also know the challenges that we saw in 2022 will continue, and we'll keep working to mitigate the big 3 that we continue to focus on: supply chain, labor and inflation. And although we're monitoring the macro environment, we remain optimistic on the economic outlook as the demand drivers for our businesses remain incredibly strong. As Chris mentioned, we're actively preparing for the demand ahead by expanding capacity, investing in digital solutions, and leveraging automation to unlock efficiencies across our value streams. We have the right team in place, and we're making the right investments. And we're also taking proactive actions to mitigate the risks we see today and to ensure success not just in 2023 but beyond.  The streamlining lining of our businesses is just the next step in our journey on leveraging the unique scale and capabilities of RTX to deliver value for our customers and our shareowners. Right now, it's all about program execution and managing costs. We have the backlog. We have the demand, and we have the technology and our balance between defense and commercial aero will help us navigate into the future.  We will, of course, continue to stay disciplined in capital allocation, and we're going to generate strong free cash flow this year and beyond, all of which enables us to return significant value to our share owners. Most importantly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2025 targets. We're going to provide an update at our upcoming Investor Day, which will be on June 19 at the Paris Air Show.   Before I close, I really want to say a special thank you to Roy Azevedo for his many contributions to Raytheon over these past 34 years. Roy has been a key member of our senior leadership team at RTX for the past 3 years, and we wish him nothing but health and success as he moves into the next phase of his career.   So with that, let's close out the -- this portion and open it up for questions. Latif? [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Greg, just like to follow up on your final comment there on your confidence in 2025, whether this confidence has been shaken anyway by this change in the R&D tax legislation but also the supply chain challenges because you basically have to double the cash flow between now and then to get to your target. Rob, that is a great question, one that we have been working through over these last couple of months. We obviously thought going into the end of 2022 that the tax legislation, the R&D amortization would get eliminated. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. That cost us $1.6 billion last year. As Neil said, it will be another $1.4 billion. And as we go into the 2025 time frame, that drag will still be about $1 billion, about $800 million of that is actual net R&D deferral and there's a couple of hundred million dollars of additional interest expense and financing our little loan to the government.  So is all that being equal, we still see -- and we had always talked about a $10 billion free cash flow in 2025. Realistically, I think that number is going to be $9 billion. Now most of that growth from, let's call it, $5 billion this year to $9 billion is going to come from segment operating profit, which should grow between 2022 and 2025 by about $5 billion. And that just assumes an execution on the current demand that we have in backlog, right? That's -- there's nothing else magic about that except the continued return of people flying and the defense budgets remaining very robust. So we see a path to the $9 billion. I don't see a path to the $10 billion today because of the R&D. But it's a long time. We hope that people in Washington will understand that they're making a very, very bad tactical decision here and not allowing us to deduct R&D, but it is the reality that we face today. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Maybe a little bit more focus on 2023. You mentioned 400 suppliers in the supply chain. How are you expecting the supply chain to unravel across both the commercial aerospace and defense segments. And you mentioned $2 billion of inflation headwinds. Can you talk about the impact of pricing on a net basis and across the businesses, maybe where you're seeing the most impact? Sheila, it's Chris. I'll start with this one and then invite Neil and Greg to chime in. So let's talk about supply chain for a minute. Maybe start with the positive, which was -- saw some stabilization as we exited the year last year. If you look at R&D, material receipts were up 30% Q3 to Q4. Supplier delinquencies were down. At Pratt, we saw some uptick in casting deliveries. So those are some of the green shoots that we saw at the end of the year.  But I'll tell you, it's not where we need to be, especially for the back half of '23. The kinds of things that we're focused on, candidly, are the things that we can control. We've got the people on site, as you mentioned, and they're responding to engineering and quality issues, giving us better visibility of what's going on. We're leaving bottlenecks and also finding issues earlier than perhaps we were previously giving us more time to react. We've qualified some additional suppliers and negotiated additional LTAs. I think we did about 400 agreements last year with about $1.8 billion in annual spend. So again, giving our suppliers better visibility into our demand and what we're doing.  And then candidly, we're taking some actions in our own house to better enable supply chain performance, small things like reducing the time it takes to place a PO to perhaps more complex things like engineering changes to improve the yields on some of our complex parts and ensuring we've got sort of a stable configuration as programs move from development into production. So those are all the things that we're focused on continue to drive health and supply chain. But you're right, we're going to need it to perform to hit these numbers we've got here in '23 and beyond. So Sheila, the other question you had there was on inflation. And I think, again, we -- the $2 billion of inflation is a real number we saw last year. We were able to overcome it through cost reduction as well as some additional pricing. And again, we will see pricing benefits again in 2023, especially on the commercial aftermarket side. Keep in mind also on the defense side, about 1/3 of our business is cost type cost reimbursable. And so some of that inflation gets passed automatically along to our customer at the Department of Defense.  As I think about that $2 billion, right, about $1.2 billion, I think Chris said is product related and about $800 million of that is people cost. And that is a real number. We've got roughly $20 billion in compensation costs across RTX that's about a 4% increase year-over-year for $800 million. It's a big number. But again, we've got plans in place for cost reduction, both in the supply chain and in the factories as well as in the back office. And some of this transformation activity that Chris mentioned with the realignment of the businesses will also present us an opportunity to get after some of that cost. So it's real, but we've got plans and I think we have more than provided for that in the guidance that Neil covered. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Question for you about this restructuring reorganization, I guess, in the defense business at Raytheon. I think we all understand that you'll get cost synergies out of it. But if you look at RIS in the quarter with the sales down 5%, how does the reorganization boost sales synergies. I think that that's the first question. And then the second question is -- I mean, it's really -- I mean, how do you boost that? And then the second question is, is there some restructuring that actually has to go on in that portfolio? Because are there some businesses in there that are just structurally lagging? Ron, it's Chris. Maybe I'll take a crack at the sales synergy. So again, as we kind of said upfront, this is about taking the organization to the next level, right? You got a tremendous defense backlog, something like $70 billion RIS R&D. And this is really about enhancing customer alignment and coordination. We've had customer feedback throughout the last couple of years about the need for us to figure out how to better integrate some of our solutions, providing mission solutions to the customers, coming in with a unified narrative and an investment story.  All of these things, I think, will enable us to work better and frankly, collaborate better across businesses. In large organizations like ours, you won't be surprised to hear that sometimes there's some friction there, and we think this will help remove some of that friction and again, provide better solutions to the customer. So thus far, the customer feedback, those that we've spoken to sort of see that potential and to us to execute on it.   As of the portfolio, I think, again, RIS has a very strong portfolio. Book-to-bill was 0.96, not necessarily where we wanted. We had some campaigns push out of the year, but feel really strong again about the portfolio, and we're going to continue to invest in it. Ron, let me just jump in and add to that. As we look at this reorganization, this is not just about putting RIS and RMD together to recreate the old legacy Raytheon company. We're going to look to take the entire portfolio of RIS, Collins, R&D and move the pieces where they most appropriately aligned from a technology and a customer standpoint.  So you may well see pieces, especially related to JADC2 moving into the Collins business. We'll see how all of this evolves over the next several months. I would tell you by the time we get to the end of the first quarter, we should have a really good understanding of what the new organization is going to look like. We'll share that with everybody at that point. It's going to take us longer than that to actually do the rewiring, that's why we're talking about kind of a midyear.  But I agree with Chris. I think the portfolio that we have across the legacy Raytheon and Collins business is really quite strong. And the book-to-bill we'll be -- we'll get better at some of those legacy RINS businesses, especially in the Space segment. I would also tell you that the performance in Q4 was not great, but it was really program -- legacy programs from many years ago that we still have not completed. So there's some work to do there. But I would tell you the portfolio is not broken or the business is not broken. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Recognizing that there's multiple top line inputs that are out of your control at the moment, which of the 2025 segment margin targets hold and which do not at this point? Because in the 2 aerospace segments, the '24, '25 incrementals required to get there are a lot better than '23. And then obviously, on the defense side, it requires a pretty big step up. So help me with that math? And I guess, just what's the latest medium-term outlook for each of the segment margins? Yes. Noah let me take a stab at that one for you because as you look out to 2025, clearly, we've had in 2022 some supply chain and labor impacts that have kind of caused us to come in a little lower than our initial expectations. However, when you think about that backlog that we've been talking about, it's $175 billion at the company level, $69 billion, $70 billion within the defense.  We have a lot to deliver ahead of us. And so I think there's going to be some puts and takes as we look at the segments on an individual basis as you get out to 2025. But as I step back and look at the totality of RTX and where we projected to be and where we're aiming to go and with that backlog, we feel confident that we can get there. We can get the sales growth, get the earnings growth and Greg already hit on the cash flow pieces there.  So some things have changed since we've talked in 2021. We're certainly dealing with a lot more inflation, but we've also got the situation in Ukraine that has given R&D some tailwinds. So when we get to June, we'll be able to lay out that in more detail. It also be aligned with the format of our new operating segments at that time.  But I think there's going to be some puts and takes, but we're all focused on driving margin improvements and making the right investments to drive that automation in the factory and digitization. I should add to Greg's comments earlier about the free cash flow walk. We'll probably see about $0.5 billion of capital headwind between 2022 and 2023. So making the right investments. I'm really focused on earnings growth and conversion to cash and so we'll see where the margins land, but I do think we're going to get that earnings growth. Is it your anticipation that you'll have a few hundred basis points of defense segment margin expansion over the next few years? And is that all cost or is that mix? Or is it not dealing with supply chain? Or how do you do that? It's -- I would tell you, it is a combination of all of those things. It's supply chain getting better, which allows us to see productivity in our factories. It's also -- as we move from these LRIP contracts, initial rates of production on LTAMS and SPY-6 and others to full rate production to see an improvement in margin on the production side as well as the mix of DoD versus international sales. Today, we're actually at a low point of about 30% in RMD of international versus DoD sales that actually transitions back towards a more historical level 40%, 45% as we do more exports, especially around LTAMS and some of these other new systems. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment, Baird. Greg, I want to stay in R&D. You've just up low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. Just in the backdrop it seems like it should be potentially better than that. Obviously, wondering if you could just kind of parse out how much is being impacted by the supply chain? And if -- just when we think about all the DoD potential replenishment activity, plus you've got strong demand from NATO Allied. Just a lot of opportunities for the space. It feels like you should be having a more potentially sustained top line growth. Maybe just your thoughts on that over the coming next couple of years. Peter, I think you're spot on. I think as we look at '23 and then '24, there is more growth potential at RMD than there probably is at any business outside of Collins just because, again, the backlog is so strong. I would tell you, given the challenges that we saw in supply chain last year and driving material in, I think we've taken a more conservative view of 2023 performance there. I think total material inputs at RMD last year were around $6 billion. This year, we're looking at about $6.5 billion. But quite frankly, the demand is out there for more. So that $6.5 billion should also drive some productivity, $100 million to $150 million. Again, I think that's actually light by historical standards, but we're -- I hate to say that we're conservative again and again. But really we set these targets. So we think we can absolutely deliver. We're not going to have to go back and relook at these in the middle of the year. But there is certainly the demand out there for higher top line and that would result in higher bottom line.  But most of that growth, I think, will come in 2024 when we really see supply chain back to where we had seen it prepandemic. And that is the key for RMD. They've got the orders. We've got the capacity. We just have to bring -- drive the material in and that $6.5 billion that we see next year is going to have to continue to grow significantly to meet the demand out there that we see. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. And Greg, just a follow-up first. I think you just said RMD might have the fastest growth outside of Collins. And I just wanted to clarify, is Pratt still the faster growing of the 2? Or is Collins now faster growing? From a bottom line perspective, it's going to be Collins, right? I think, again, top line, you're going to see -- what is the number, Neil, for '23 here for Pratt? For '23, they'll be up low to mid-teens. So very substantial growth for '23. And sort of as you look out over the next several years, these all 4 businesses are in the same ZIP code of high single-digit type of sales growth on a CAGR basis. And maybe a more detailed question on Pratt. If you can just give a little color on where GTF is in the aftermarket composition, where legacy higher-margin aftermarket is in that composition? How those 2 play out over the next several years? And also how the GTF aftermarket is trending versus your sort of assumptions of profitability on those long-term contracts? Myles, this is Chris. Maybe just as a step back for a minute on GTF. Demand remains really, really strong. As you know, we continue to do the block upgrades to drive improved time on wing, obviously improved time on wing helps with their contract profitability. We continue to incorporate upgrades to sort of improve the customer experience.   On the aftermarket side, in 2022 turned slightly positive. And so from this point, it's about accelerating those margins. You're going to see that through some better contract mix as we talked about back in Investor Day in '21. You're going to see that through increased time on wing through some of these upgrades. And so the GTF aftermarket profitability is something that is of high focus  given the growing installed base, gets above 2,500 engines out there and a very large backlog. So GTF aftermarket is a huge driver. And maybe I'll just put a couple of financial numbers around that to help out a little bit. But at Pratt for 2023, we think the aftermarket there will be up between 20% and 25% from a sales perspective. So think about the legacy shop visits being about 15% to 20% up year-over-year.   On the OE side, that would imply about a mid-teens sort of a sales growth there. So we see strong growth, obviously, in the commercial business. And I guess while I'm on Pratt, I'll just throw out a couple of the Collins numbers just so everyone has them. In their aftermarket business, think about that as being up sort of low double digits to low teens, sequentially kind of growing in the low single-digit percentage kind of range. And on the OE side, up low to mid-teens year-over-year. So again, with all that OE growth that we see across the narrow and wide-body platforms, you'll see that both at Pratt and Collins. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Greg, I guess following up on that. Could you just comment where you are on, I guess, across mainly Collins, but also touching on Pratt, where you are relative to the manufacturer stated rates, I guess, in particular on the MAX in the low 30s, A320 in the mid- to high 40s and 787 around 2 a month. David, it's something we focus a lot on. Obviously, we are, I would tell you, at Collins and at Pratt in lockstep with Boeing and Airbus in terms of their production rates. Obviously, some of the challenges that we've talked about at Pratt on the supply chain with structural castings is limited, I would say, some of our ability to meet some of the demand out there, that's starting to ease. And again, we are working very closely with Airbus on the A320 production rate.  As far as 737, that's really a Collins story. And we -- the outlook that Neil talked about, that assumes those rates that you talked about around 31 aircraft or so a month on average. I think they were a little light on that in the fourth quarter, but we think we'll get back to that. They still have roughly 200 aircraft that be delivered that are in inventory, too, from when the line was shutdown, which, again, also is part of Collins' upside for the year.  As far as 78 -- 787, we see that, as you said, I think it's 1 a month going to 2 a month and perhaps up to 3. Again, I think that's -- that will all depend upon Boeing's ability to continue to get the aircraft out the door. But we are working with them on a daily, weekly basis to make sure that we can support them. But we don't see anything in our supply chain today that would prevent us from delivering either at Boeing or Airbus to the rates that they need. Great. And Greg, could you just comment on the Interiors business, how that's doing? Is that -- if you're starting to see a pickup there from the widebody side? Yes. It's -- David, I want to say, it is probably the slowest recovery of all of the Collins businesses to your point because it is primarily widebody. And as the airlines were conserving cash for these last couple of years, we saw sales down significantly. We don't expect a recovery in the interiors business literally over the next 3 years. So it gets better, but it's still not back to what it was prepandemic. It's -- it will remain a challenge. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. So cash flow -- in the fourth quarter, you had a $900 million uptick in payables, a huge uptick in contract liabilities and yet inventory where you normally get a benefit in the fourth quarter were actually up a bit. Maybe comment on some of those trends and how that translates to a flat year in 2023. Thanks, Cai. Let me start on 2022 and where we ended the year. You're right, the inventory was up. I would say most of that was at Pratt & Collins as you think about the backlog, the growth rates we just talked about on the commercial aerospace side and the supply chain issues that we're all working to overcome.  We were pretty strategic in our thinking around making sure we're bringing the materials and so that we can deliver and meet the customer commitments. You pointed out the accounts payable growth there. So not all, but a large portion of that inventory growth was sort of offset by the payables to kind of go along with that.  On the advances side or the contract side, really, that was driven by some -- a couple of large international advances that we received in December. That contributed to our overdrive of free cash flow, which was about $500 million relative to our expectations. That will be a drag on working capital as you get into 2023.  And as I look at the '23 free cash flow, we see a little bit of headwind on the working capital, in part because of some of the advances that we got at the end of 2022. And I'd say in part because we're going to continue to be pretty strategic about making sure that we bring in parts and materials where we need them and where there's constraints and bottlenecks in the supply chain, value stream right now.  So on balance, we're always targeting to take that inventory balance down, but we want to be smart and make sure we have the products so we can deliver it. We will be seeing improved velocity through our factories as we go through '23. So I'd expect the turns to improve here. But all eyes on the inventory management for sure, and then managing through the collections as we get into 2023 at our international customer sites. Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Greg and Chris, following up on the supply chain, what issues are the same versus 2022 versus what issues are different, I mean considering the strengthening visibility on demand, I would have assumed that we've seen a lot more improvement by now. So what's the root of the problem. And can you provide more details on the actions you're taking to get this resolved by the second half of the year? Kristine, it's Chris. So I would say the constraints are those that we've talked about previously. I said that we saw some improvement on castings, but it's not where it needs to be, so castings is still there. Rocket Motors continues to be a pacing item at R&D. And microelectronics, while the lead times have stabilized, they haven't come down in back to 2019 historical levels. And so those are sort of the 3 main areas that I talked about. We've talked about in the past that continue to be a headwind as we're moving into '23.  In terms of the specific actions, I talked about a few of them earlier. But again, some of this is what I would call blocking and tackling, in the factories, whether it be ours or our supply chain. And I mentioned that before. In some cases, we'll try to make an engineering change to improve producibility and ultimately yield. In other places, we just need to be in with our customer answering quality questions and making sure we can help them relieve bottlenecks.  On Microelectronics, a lot of that was about really the supply base, understanding our demand and then working some interesting agreements, negotiated agreements on making sure that we had our priority placed in line, and we made sure that we had our right allocation. With what you're seeing on the consumer side in terms of microelectronics coming down, we expect to see our allocation get better in that area. But again, still not where it needs to be here in '23. We are assuming a back half recovery. So certainly not all is lost, but it will be the man-to-man defense here to get to that point. And Greg, maybe a follow-up. You mentioned on your commentary on commercial large structural casting. It sounded more constructive today than your commentary in previous quarters. I was wondering what changed in the supply chain that you're seeing to make you more confident? How much of that is the OEMs walking away from -- like Airbus walking away from 75 per month versus you're seeing that use through investments they're making or maybe labor easing. I think, Kristine, if you think about the structural casting issue, we're not out of the woods, as Chris said, but it has certainly gotten a lot better from where we were a year ago today. And we continue to work with the suppliers there, primarily around the requirement side, making sure that the specifications that we're flowing down are actually producible in the supply chain. So that's giving us this confidence. But as Chris said, it's going to be the end of 2023 before we see structural castings back to 2019 levels. Again, we've got confidence they have been bringing people on, they have been training people. We have folks out there helping them. But all of that would support the OE rates that we need to support for 2023. Anything you want to add there, Chris? Yes. I would just support what you said, Greg, that our supply chain is bringing in labor they're starting to see more success on that front. But in some cases, like take casting it is a pretty complex process. And there's a learning curve for folks that you bring in and take some time to come down that learning curve to get to a level of productivity that we need to see for the improvements here. But again, focused on that in the back half of '23. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. On Pratt, you're talking about 15% to 20% growth in the aftermarket, on the legacy programs this year. One of the things that we've been concerned about has been capacity constraints, just it's taking longer, say we get a V2500 into a shop for an overhaul and longer to get it through. When you look at that upside you're forecasting, how are you thinking about the capacity issue, labor availability? And is there potentially further upside from that if you can actually get -- have more success there. Doug, let me start with that, and maybe Chris will add. So as we think about the outlook, you're right to say that we see the large commercial engine -- legacy commercial engine shop visits up 15% to 20%. Think about the Vs being up around 20. And if you think about the math there, we were a little over 700 or so as we exited 2022. So that puts us in the mid-800s kind of a range expectation for 2023, which is a level we've been at before.  So as it relates to capacity, we have that level of capacity for the legacy shop visits. And it really then comes back to the conversation we've been having here for the last hour about ensuring that the supply chain is there and ready to support that level of shop visit inductions, which again, we've been planning. These expectations are in line with the numbers that Chris put out there back in May of 2021. So again, the supply chain, I think, expects this level of an uptick in our shops to as well.  In terms of -- is there upside as you think about retirements of this aircraft, for example, it was 21 aircraft in the last year got retired that were V2500 powered. So I'm not going to get ahead of ourselves. But I think that when you look at the dynamics around OE deliveries today of new aircraft, we think the V2500 still has a lot of life left in it. About 1/3 of that fleet has yet to see its first shop visit. And so I'm cautiously optimistic that we will see that fly for a longer period of time at these elevated levels. Chris, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add to that. Doug, I would add that you're right, turn times have been elevated on V and other platforms. And so we don't see as many supply chain constraints there, perhaps as we do in other areas. I would say the labor is stabilizing. Again, you bring in people off the street to do MRO, there is a learning curve associated with that individual becoming a productive technician and maintenance personnel.  But we believe we've got the plan in place there. In terms of upside, I mean, again, if you listen to lessors and others out there today, and Neil kind of referenced this, given the supply chain challenges we're having on perhaps new production, you're seeing airlines hold on to older assets longer, signing up for longer leases. So again, it kind of goes to the life of the V2500 maybe being some upside there. And just really quick, what was the favorable contract adjustment, the size of that Pratt for the quarter? From an operating profit, think about a few pennies. Our final question will come from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Guys, I wonder if we could dig in a little bit more on the GTF. And you talked, Chris, a little bit about the time on wing. What we've been reading lately from comments from some of the leasing companies and comments in the press is the time on wing on new generation engines has been falling short of expectations. And so a, kind of to what degree do you share that perception and kind of where does it need to get; b, what specifically in the engine, do you need to kind of improve to get it there; and then the last part is, I think you mentioned the GTF aftermarket profits were positive for the first time. And just with a relatively young pool of engines and maybe some time on wing challenges, how did profits get to positive? So I would say that I generally agree with the sentiment that you're hearing, time on wing, and we've been pretty open about this. And very open dialogue with our customers about time on wing, on newer platforms, not necessarily being where we wanted them to be when we launched the program. We have done a number of block upgrades. As I said, we've got a block upgrade going in now through MRO that increases time on wing.  On average, about 20% just based on the geography that you're in. And we've got some other, I'd say, durability and reliability hardware and software fixes that we put in as well. So we want to -- we obviously want to get to the contractual levels that we have promised, and we've got a plan to go do that with these upgrades.  I will tell you, keep in mind, you've got the GTF advantage that's going to start cutting in, in 2024. As you know, that's the next generation of the GTF, more thrust, better fuel burn, started flight testing in Q4 with Airbus, and we remain on track there in -- for 2024 EIS. That takes all of the lessons learned we've had on the, what I call base GTF program and some enhanced testing. And we think that that's the next generation that will get to the levels of performance and time on wing that our customers are anticipating. But even on the -- what I'll call the existing fleet today, we've got upgrade plans to continue to push that time on wing higher and higher. Our customers are demanding it, and our contracts are dependent on it. So we're aligned there. Okay. Thanks, Seth, and thank you, everyone, for listening today. As always, Jennifer and her team are going to be available today, tomorrow, the rest of the week to answer any follow-up questions that you have. Thank you for listening, and take care, everyone. This now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Brady Connor, and I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Hans Vestberg; and Matt Ellis, our Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement, which can be found on Slide 2 of the presentation. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials posted on our website.  Earlier this morning, we posted to our Investor Relations website a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. I hope you all had a chance to read the material. I'm going to briefly discuss the financial highlights before turning the call over to Hans to lead a discussion on our strategy, guidance and forward-looking view of the business.  Slide 3 shows a summary of our results. Consolidated total operating revenue was $35.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3.5% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, benefiting from unlimited plan migrations, our best fourth quarter total postpaid net additions in 7 years, pricing actions that we began implementing in June of 2022 and a full quarter contribution from TracFone.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $11.7 billion for the fourth quarter, down 0.2% year-over-year. Wireless service revenue growth was offset by higher promotional expense, declines in our high-margin legacy wireline business and inflationary cost pressures. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $1.19, a decrease of 10.5% compared to the similar period in 2021, driven by higher interest expense, depreciation and lower pension-related income. Finally, we delivered $14.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2022 and exited the year with a net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.7x.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Hans. Thank you, Brady, and good morning, everyone. On today's earnings call, I will focus on our strategy, guidance, expectation for the business and why I'm so excited about the opportunities for the year ahead.  Let me start by saying that we delivered against all of our revised financial targets provided in July, including 8.6% wireless service revenue growth, $47.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share of $5.18. I'm pleased that the momentum built during the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter.  Last quarter, we set the expectation of a positive consumer phone net adds in the fourth quarter, and we delivered against that expectation. Although we have more work to do, I'm encouraged by the improvement and expect to build on the momentum in 2023. The improvement in the consumer performance was complemented by yet another strong mobility quarter in Verizon Business Group as well as continued success in fixed wireless access with net adds up sequentially in both consumer and business. Together with Fios result, we added 416,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, our best total broadband performance in over a decade, and approximately 1.3 million total broadband net adds for the year.  Regarding our guidance, we have positioned ourselves to improve on our performance in 2023 and expect to build a good underlying operational momentum, although that will be offset by the impact of the noncash factors such as promo amortization in our revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, we're seeing some impact of high interest rates. At the same time, we expect our capital spending to reduce significantly in 2023 as we reach the end of our incremental C-Band spending, which will be a tailwind for free cash flow. We're striving to make further improvement and take even more action that will ultimately lead to better performance than the guidance we have outlined today. Matt will discuss the guidance in more detail later in the call.  The industry enters 2023 with continued macroeconomic uncertainty as elevated inflation and interest rates impact the broader economy. Still, demand for our service remains strong, given the growing importance of mobility and broadband to both consumers and businesses. The combination of our network reliability, diverse portfolio of products and services and the industry's strongest customer base provides us the flexibility to meet the changing customer needs even in a difficult economic environment.  We measure our success in maximizing value across stakeholders by our ability to grow service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Taking these 3 metrics together is how we hold ourselves accountable. We are well positioned to improve our performance and accelerate growth on a go-forward basis with network quality as the foundation for our strategy and growth. We expect that wireless mobility and nationwide broadband will be the most significant contributors to Verizon's growth for the next several years. In 2022, we made important progress in each of these businesses. Our growth in these areas will be driven by extending our network advantage using our C-Band spectrum, which we expect will strengthen our network leadership in the coming years.  We are taking a balanced approach on how we run our business. Adding the right customers and generating ongoing profits from them is how we maximize value. We remain focused on our cost reduction and efficiency actions while also maximizing our return on invested capital via better monetizing our assets to put us on track to improve free cash flow going forward. We're proud of being the strongest in the industry in terms of generating cash and want to preserve that while also continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We're executing with discipline and will continue driving a strategy which produces sustainable long-term growth and profitability.  As connectivity plays an increasingly important role for consumers and businesses, it is the quality of the connectivity that matters the most. Not all networks are architected and built the same nor have the same quality. We have seen these differences in the past and expect that 5G will be no different. Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years.  In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-Band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our company's history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POPs targeted by year-end 2024. C-Band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-Band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-Band spectrum later this year.  Due to the timing of spectrum availability, our deployment strategy targets the highest user areas first with the capability to deliver the most distinguished experience in places where the majority of our customers consume mobile services. As additional spectrum is cleared, we will have access to many new markets. As with prior generations of wireless technology, customers in all areas can expect to receive the best network experience.  And where we have built out the C-Band, we're only getting started. Early deployments have limited to 60 megahertz or 100 megahertz in some early clearance markets. Consumer performance in this market has been encouraging as evidenced by better retention, more favorable gross add trends and higher premium uptake. In addition, the majority of our consumer fixed wireless net adds are on C-Band. With the final transfer of spectrum expected to be available in late 2023, we can deploy an average of 161 megahertz and up to 200 megahertz in certain markets across the entire continental U.S.  When we turn on the full breadth of spectrum, we expect peak download speeds to reach 2.4 gigabits per second, up from the 900 megabits per second we see with 60 megahertz deployed, all while supporting far more users and applications. At the same time, we're also deploying our 5G stand-alone core. So by the end of the year, you should see a network with incredible speeds, both downlink and uplink, and position to deliver 5G capabilities such as network slicing, voice over 5G and/or among others.  We believe our network will allow us to maintain our premium position with our wireless mobility customers and provide reliable fixed wireless access services to consumers and businesses across the country. This is an example of how we can monetize our multipurpose network by scaling several revenue streams on the same infrastructure to enhance our return on investment. We're adding far more capacity to our network than the peak usage increase we're expecting in fixed wireless markets. We continue to expect that we'll have 4 million to 5 million fixed wireless subscribers by the end of 2025, and those subscribers will be enabled by our current build and capital plans.  Our mobility and broadband plans are supported by our deep fiber position and ongoing fiber investments. Approximately 50% of our sites are now served by our own fiber, up from 45% last year. We believe we are the only provider serving the level of its wireless network with its own fiber. This supports superior quality of services and end-to-end owners' economics. That means better reliability and higher margins and look for us to continue to expand the percentage of sites on our own fiber. We also expanded our Fios footprint by over 550,000 locations in 2022, extending our Fios open for sales to more than 17 million locations. You can expect continued fiber expansion in the years ahead.  In summary, network quality is the foundation for our strategy and growth, and all of the moves we are making are focused on ensuring we continue our network leadership in the future.  As I mentioned earlier, Verizon's success should be measured against 3 important metrics: service revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Let me now cover each of these in detail and tell you why I'm so confident in our ability to deliver against all 3 of these benchmarks.  We expect that our network differentiation will be the cornerstone of our service revenue growth and that it will allow us to continue to attract the highest quality customer base in the industry and maintain our market-leading share of the B2B market. Our fixed wireless access is also expected to contribute more meaningfully to service revenue as we enter the year growing rapidly with a base of more than 1.4 million subscribers. 2022 demonstrated to us that we need to be even more agile and responsive in the consumer market. This is one of the reasons I assumed leadership of the business late last year. We are moving into 2023 with momentum and expectation for improved performance based on recent actions and planned initiatives.  After integrating TracFone over the last year, we now have a full complement of offerings from entry-level prepaid all the way up to premium unlimited postpaid plans for the first time in our history. This will enable us to better attract new customers while also retaining customers through their mobile journey. You have already seen us take more segmented approach to the market through the Welcome Unlimited and One Unlimited plans in postpaid and the launch of Total by Verizon in prepaid. We're already seeing the benefits from these actions.  In 2013, our plans will continue to evolve as we look for the best ways to cater to our customers, whether through network experience, content or other product offerings. Each new offering gives us an opportunity to engage with the prospective customers and ensure they receive the plan that best fits their needs. We remain disciplined around our core pricing and continue to perform well with our premium customers on retention and step-up activity. As we move into 2013, we're taking a more localized approach with our network and go-to-market strategy, providing greater autonomy to the teams on the front line and speeding up the pace of decision-making. This will allow us to compete more effectively across geographies, particularly where dynamics may differ by individual market.  Finally, we continue to revise our sales compensation structure, ensuring we have the right incentives in place to drive sales growth. The customers we have and continue to attract represent the highest quality customer base in the industry. Based on our customer payment patterns, which are at or better than pre-pandemic levels, and the low delinquency rates in our securitized device payment plan portfolios, we continue to see only a limited impact from the macroeconomic environment on our customers. While we are watching this closely, we have a lot of confidence in the resilience of our customer base.  Scaling of new business such as private 5G networks and edge computing will also be a strategic focus in 2023. Our funnel is strong, and we are making the appropriate investment to ensure such services provide a meaningful contribution to future growth in the years ahead, which differentiates us in the industry.  You can expect Verizon to compete, but I want to underline again that we will not sacrifice financials for volumes. We continue to focus on improving our cost of acquisition and retention and believe current promotional incentives are not sustainable for the industry in the long run. Although we have participated, to some extent, in this dynamic, expect us to pursue more ways to move away from the aggressive handset subsidies with offers like Welcome Unlimited plan, which offers attractive headline pricing for customers while reducing device subsidies. We manage the business for profitability, and such actions drive healthy lifetime value for the business.  Moving to Business wireline. We're taking several actions to reduce the financial impact of the unit and are scaling back on pursuing low margin revenue in order to again drive improved profitability. While this may result in missing out on revenue, it is the right move and one that will lead to higher margin and cash flow over time. At the same time, we are focused on further improving the cost structure through greater efficiencies.  You may recall that we embarked on a new cost-cutting initiative late last year. A component of this initiative is the formation of Verizon Global Services. This organization is accelerating efforts to drive cross-functional efficiencies, enabling us to reinvest savings in network superiority and customer growth while contributing to long-term profitability. Additional opportunity exists in sourcing, sales and marketing and corporate system, among others. The heavy lifting is now underway as we execute against our goal to deliver $2 billion to $3 billion of run rate savings by 2025. So our EBITDA strategy is clear: grow profitable volumes in both Consumer and Business based on our increasingly differentiated network and manage our expenses the way you would expect us to do.  By growing service revenue and EBITDA, we believe that we will be able to provide our shareholders with increasingly healthy free cash flow, which will support the strength of our balance sheet and fund our dividend growth. Our current streak of raising the dividend 16 years in a row is unmatched in the industry, and we intend to be able to continue that trend. Because our mobility and fixed wireless access products leverage the same infrastructure, they provide a capital-efficient path to future cash flow growth.  We believe that we will become increasingly efficient with our capital, using less capital to generate every dollar of revenue for years to come. That will enable us to produce expanding cash flow that we can both reinvest in our business and return to our shareholders.  And as you know, we're doing all of this as our capital spending budget is expected to decline from $23.1 billion in 2022 to under $19 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range this year, a reduction of nearly 20% year-over-year. In 2024, we expect our CapEx to be around $17 billion, which we expect to represent the lowest capital intensity in over a decade and among the lowest in the industry. We expect we will deliver a best-in-class network experience while reducing our 2022 CapEx leverage by more than $5 billion over the next couple of years.  With that, I turn it over to Matt to discuss guidance. Thank you, Hans, and good morning. I want to spend some time walking you through our 2023 guidance while also commenting on our longer-term outlook.  Our 2023 guidance reflects momentum we have exiting 2022, which we expect to drive wireless service revenue growth. For 2023, we expect total wireless service revenues to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, driven by increased penetration of premium unlimited plans, scaling of fixed wireless, continued growth in products and services such as content and device protection plans and the full year impact of our pricing actions taken in 2022.  As noted in our earnings materials, our wireless service revenue growth outlook includes an approximately 190 basis point benefit from a large allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees, which partially recover network operating costs to wireless service revenue from other revenue. In addition, we expect promo amortization to be approximately $1 billion higher than last year.  We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within a range of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue offset by wireline and other revenue declines and higher marketing and network operating expenses.  Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.55 to $4.85. As noted on our third quarter earnings call, high interest rates are expected to result in approximately $0.25 to $0.30 of interest expense pressure in 2023 due to higher floating rate debt costs and higher securitization costs for our growing device payment portfolio.  We continue to believe we have the right debt structure for the long term and have managed the balance sheet appropriately by keeping short-term maturities to a minimum in this higher interest rate environment. Higher rates of pension and OPEB, in addition to the lower pension asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, are also expected to impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.15 compared to 2022. This flows through other income and expense in our income statement. Finally, we expect approximately $0.03 to $0.05 of impact from higher depreciation expense, primarily driven by the C-Band equipment being put into service across '22 and into '23.  Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.0% based on current legislation. Capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion, including the final approximately $1.75 billion of the incremental $10 billion of C-Band-related capital spending. And we continue to expect total capital spending to be approximately $17 billion in 2024. The reduction from the $23.1 billion CapEx in 2022 is expected to drive higher free cash flow in 2023 despite increases in cash interest and cash taxes. As previously discussed, we will complete our accelerated $10 billion C-Band program this year, after which all C-Band capital expenditures will be part of our business-as-usual capital program.  Looking beyond 2023, given our exit rate from 2022, we don't expect to hit the long-range outlook as we projected at the Investor Day last year. However, due to the way we have positioned our network and service offerings coming into 2023, we do expect increasing growth in revenue and cash flow in subsequent years.  I will now turn it back over to Hans. Thank you, Matt. Let me summarize the Verizon opportunity in a few key points. We are making the necessary improvements to drive better performance. We have the best network, and it's only getting better even as capital intensity improves. We have the largest EBITDA base in the industry and a clear path to free cash flow expansion. And finally, we have one of the most attractive dividends in the market, and we intend to be able to continue the trend of growing the dividend each year.  By that, I hand it over to Brady to start the Q&A. Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. I had a couple of questions on the guidance. The first one is, how are you thinking about your confidence and the visibility of this guide as compared to a year ago? Obviously, we'd had the war and stuff like that. But I think the reductions in guidance, obviously, were a concern for investors. So as you went through this process, was it deliberate conservatism that you were trying to bake in to make sure that you could hit, and I think, Hans, you might have mentioned, exceed the guidance with additional steps? So that kind of setup would be great.  And then I guess for Matt, you called out some of the pressures on the bottom line. But you had a $0.30 range on your EPS guide. I think it was $0.15 a year ago. And it sounded like on the items you gave, the range wasn't that wide. So perhaps you can just give us some color on what caused you to be as wide this year on the EPS. Thank you, Simon. I can start. I mean, when it comes to the guidance, I mean, we -- of course, it's a little bit uncertain, as we said, coming into the year. But we are laser focused on the service growth and on the EBITDA expansion and hence, also the cash flow expansion. That's how we are running our business, and that's how we take decisions. And as I said, I mean, our job is, of course, to see that we are meeting or exceeding the guidance we have given out. And that's how we're going to work all the year. And our teams are set up to work like that. We are in the beginning of the year, so we're going to see how it turns out.  But clearly, we are super laser-focused in the whole company, how we're executing right now and how it hangs together. And as I said before, we have now all the assets, all the way from the network to our -- to the prepaid, to the postpaid, all that. And from us, it's a lot of execution in a competitive market. But we definitely believe we can compete very well in that market. Matt? Thanks, Simon. So look, as you think about the guide for the year, obviously, there's a number of items in there. As I think about the range, we can get to the top end of the range there with strong execution, the activity around the cost program scaling, that flywheel moving faster than our base assumption and just if we see more volumes come through the business there. Obviously, the low end will reflect the promo environment, the overall competitive environment. And then we'll see items like inflation and so on.  So the range of the EPS guide, I think very similar to the EBITDA guide that we've given. And I think it reflects, as we come into this year, when you think about some of the unknowns that will play out here in the macro environment and the competitive environment, we feel it's the right range to have for 2023. As Hans said, there's a lot of things for us to stay focused on and make sure we produce the best result possible. The next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Can we talk about consumer margins within the guidance? They were down about almost 400 basis points in '22. And Matt and Hans, you guys gave some good color on some puts and takes around promotions, around Verizon Global Services and I think, I guess, higher marketing and network operation cost. But I guess any other puts and takes to call out?  And as we look into '23, as part of the guidance, should we expect the consumer margins to sort of flatten here? And do you guys have visibility that as you guys -- a lot of these initiatives take hold that we can start to see some improving margins on the consumer side? Thank you. I mean, I can start. I mean, of course, we're doing quite a lot in the consumer segment right now, all the way from addressing areas where we have softness in our portfolio with Welcome, for example, in order to create growth. But also, we are regionalizing our business, both on the network side and the consumer side in order to take quicker decision. But also, the network is so strong in local markets where we're building out the C-Band, we want to take advantage of that. And as we said before, we have the chance to -- or we don't have the chance. We see the correlation between C-Band deployment and step-ups and, of course, fixed wireless access and the majority of our fixed wireless access customers coming on C-Band right now. So that's why.  And finally, we have also worked with the spending, the consumer investment, I call it, all the way what we're doing above the line on promo, what we're doing below the line on retention and how much we do in media. We're doing that much more agile. I think that will help us to manage and continue our clear path and a clear target of growing our top line and expanding our EBITDA. That's our job. Then there are some headwinds that Matt has talked about. But obviously, the underlying should be improving with the cost cuts and the way we're working in the consumer group. Matt? Yes. Thanks, Hans. John, so as you think about the year-over-year reduction in '22, remember at the start of the year, we said that we expected about a 200 basis point impact because of the inclusion of TracFone in the business for the year, obviously, accretive in absolute terms. But from a margin standpoint, we did expect to see that. So then obviously, there's some other items in there. We talked a little bit about the inflation impact last year, obviously, the competitive environment and the promo piece in there as well.  So there will be some things that we have the opportunity to improve on this year. Synergies from within TracFone as we move more customers over to our own network will be an upside. But then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, the promo amortization is expected to be up on a year-over-year basis as the delay between being at these higher levels from a cash basis and then that flowing through on an accounting basis. So when you net those things out, expect something initially on a -- probably a similar type of level in '23 to '22 with some opportunities to push that as we go forward into subsequent years. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. I'm actually going to stick with consumer. And I was hoping we can get a little more insight into 2 different tools you're using to go to market. The first is Welcome Unlimited. You've been advertising it quite a bit, and you've mentioned it a couple of times during your prepared remarks. I'm wondering to what extent are you finding that Welcome Unlimited is indeed a popular plan with new consumers versus the extent to which it's driving wireless shoppers into your channels where you're actually more frequently converting them into a higher-tiered plan? So that's the first question.  And then it seems like you have been reluctant to make greater use of device promos. Obviously, you were using them to some extent last year. How are you thinking about the role of device promos as you go to market this year and you look to sort of sustain these positive consumer phone net adds? Thanks. The Welcome Unlimited is working exactly as we wanted. I mean, it creates store traffic. We bring our customers in, and we see that the customer gets the plans they want. We have not seen any step-downs that is coming from that. We are more seeing an opportunity for our customers to have a conversation with them. And of course, remember, that's a bring your own device. It's for 4 lines, and that's the way we have been dealing.  And we learned a lot from the first Welcome we started with somewhere in the third quarter, I remember or beginning of -- end of the second when we saw a little bit -- and that was an area where we were soft. And that's where we clearly saw that customers were going to others. These, we now have diverted, and they come to us. And if you then add that, you see our premium unlimited continue to do well. We went up now to 45% actually from 41% in the third quarter, I think. So we added 4% more on unlimited premium. So that is working for us. We just need to be agile, stay close to see which segment and then be aggressive in the segment we need. And the segment we're performing well in, we let them continue to perform well.  And when it comes to device promos, yes, we understand that's part of the competition -- I mean, part of the market. We will be a part in that as well. But we will continue to be cautious and see that we actually are using device promos in the right moment for the right customers. And you saw us last year coming in and out. Sometimes we're a little bit more aggressive. And others, we were actually the least aggressive. And I think that's how we will continue this year, depending on where the market is going.  But what you can expect from us in the consumer unit is to be agile, take quick decisions and see if they're working, then we'll continue. If they're not working, we're pulling them. That's why I'm into this basically every day myself nowadays. And I think this has proven that we get the momentum with the team, and the team is actually executing well. We have more to do. I mean, I always say that. I mean, it's going to take a long time before I feel that I'm 100% satisfied or happy. But definitely, it's work to do here, but I've seen the good momentum. The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Sticking with wireless. On service revenue, when I pull out the definition change from other to service revenue, you're guiding to roughly 1% to 2% wireless service revenue growth in '23, which is a big deceleration from almost 6% this quarter. How should we think about this in regards to phone adds and ARPU and the impact of promotions on service revenue? Can you just put the pieces together for us? And do you expect that service revenue will stay positive each quarter this year or actually flips to negative at some point?  And just on top of that, typically, we see things much slower in terms of subscribers from 4Q to 1Q. While I don't expect you to guide on subscribers, do you think we'll see sort of typical seasonality this quarter? Or do you anticipate sort of better performance? I can start, and then Matt can break down the numbers you're talking about. I mean, yes, we -- on the premium segment, there is seasonality in the first quarter, and I don't think that's going to be different this year. However, our work is to keep up the momentum that we had from the fourth quarter into this year, where we had good store traffic year, quarter-over-quarter and also high conversion rate. But it also means that we need to be agile and see what's happening in the market. And it's a little bit early to do any guidance or something like that, which we're not doing on net adds. But clearly, there is going to be seasonality. But we have good momentum. And we're going to continue to execute and be very close to the market. Matt? Yes. Phil, so kind of unpacking some of the piece parts of your question there. So seasonality, absolutely, we expect that to look reasonably as you would expect throughout the year from an overall standpoint.  In terms of the service revenue guide, your math there is correct. When you think about the fourth quarter, you said close to 6%, remember that included a full quarter of owning Trac in 4Q this year versus only part of 4Q last year. So as we get into '23, finally on a year-over-year basis to talk about stuff on an apples-to-apples basis and not with and without M&A items, which is nice. So once you remove that, very similar.  In terms of the piece parts within wireless service revenue guide, think about you got the positive impacts of the price ups. Obviously, we had 6 months' impact last year, approximately. You get a full year impact this year, also the benefit of the FWA momentum we had and having 1.4 million subscribers in the base at the start of this year that we're billing throughout the year. But that's offset by the promo amortization, which, as I mentioned in the up-front comments, will be higher in the income statement year-over-year with the timing of the recognition of that and then also the impact of the volumes last year offsetting some of the ARPA benefit we had.  So the task for the team going forward is to continue the momentum that we started to see in the second half of last year, as Hans mentioned. And that will put us in a position to continue to push service revenue in a positive direction going forward. The next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. The first one, maybe, Matt, could we refresh the free cash flow outlook for 2023? I think the midpoint was $21 billion for 2023 from last year's Analyst Day. I think if we look at the EBITDA guidance, which is roughly flat, interest expense guidance, which is up $1 billion, the CapEx, which is down $4 billion, it feels like it should be roughly $17 billion, unless there's other things in taxes and working capital related to some of these promotions. So if you could kind of refresh that a little bit, that would be awesome.  And then Hans, you called out 3 things as it relates to the C-Band deployment. And this has been a big success for Verizon is getting this build done. I think that some people have been asking themselves like where the return is from all the money that's been spent. And you highlighted higher retention, better gross adds and higher premium take rate. Are there numbers that you can put around that, that we could grab on to and say, \"When, in 2024, Verizon doubles their footprint in C-Band with the new spectrum getting cleared, we can put a number on that and say, 'This is going to be the return that Verizon gets from this build?'\" Why don't you start, Matt, and I take the second question on the C-Band. Yes. So on the free cash flow, David, obviously, last year, we said that we expect -- you had the right number, the expectation of where we said free cash flow might be for '23. As I think about where we see the business today versus where it was a year ago, a couple of factors that are different. You have CapEx very much in line with where we thought it would be at this point. The team did a great job last year deploying C-Band. And obviously, we spent most of the $10 billion. So you get a nice year-over-year benefit.  Offsetting that, cash taxes will be higher this year as we have less benefit from a higher CapEx number and also bonus depreciation dropping down. That was in our expectation last year. Interest rates were obviously very different than we expected last year, you touched on those. And then the jump-off point from the EBITDA in the business at the end of '22 to '23, lower than we hoped to be at the Investor Day a year ago. So you've got the right moving parts there.  We're not guiding specifically to a cash flow number. We historically haven't, but you've got the right moving pieces in there. So net-net, the CapEx reduction year-over-year gives us a good tailwind to think about cash flow for this year. So with that, I'll hand you to the C-Band question. Yes. And it's, of course, a focus for us to continue to grow the cash flow, as we have said so many times. So we will continue on that work.  When it comes to the C-Band, first of all, we have said from the beginning, the C-Band acquisition we did is a multi-decade spectrum. It's going to -- in so much and in so many years. And of course, that was a deliberate decision because we believe we're going to be in wireless business for the eternity of Verizon's history. So that's very important.  However, when it comes to the impacts, and I think I mentioned some of them, if you think about fixed wireless access, the majority of all new customers are coming on the C-Band right now. That's a clear indication. Without the C-Band, we couldn't grow the broadband right now. We did a history high of 1.4 billion net adds in the year of broadband subscribers. So of course, a lot have contributed to C-Band, and that's a clear metric to have.  The other metrics you have is, of course, the unlimited premium, where we say that actually, we are performing very well, where we have deployed the C-Band in order to get customers to step up. And the step-up is very important. We are in a multi-subscription business or we are in a subscription business. And the more you can see that you're upgrading the price, the P on that quantity, it's enormously important for the long-term value for our customers.  Other -- the third one that is coming and I mentioned also when I opened is, of course, private 5G networks, mobile edge compute. All that is, of course, going to be very much supported by the C-Band as well. There, we will come back and start reporting on that when we feel that, that is coming into the play from a more significant portion. But mobility -- and remember also that we have the wireless business side, the business side actually growing because of the reliability of our network and the resilience of our network, which is how our enterprise customers are buying from us when it comes to wireless business. So I think there are many metrics that you can see already now that is really connected to the C-Band.  Then I just want to remind you, it's almost less -- I think it's 1 year since we got -- since we launched the C-Band. It's only 1 year, and we're going to cross 200 million POPs. We have never built so fast in the entire history of the company, and we're well ahead of the plan to hit the 250 million POPs that we said at the Investor Day by end of '24. So I think that this is really a game changer in the market. And we see performance-wise, we're outperforming. We have the most resilient 5G network in the nation, and we're just starting.  You're starting with 60 and 100 megahertz. And as you heard me talking, we have 160 in average. It's going to be 200 later on. It is a game changer, and we can already see it right now. And we see already metrics right now that is proving it. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson -- I'm sorry, Michael Rollins of Citibank. Two questions, if I could. The first one, as you mentioned earlier in the discussion that you pulled back from some of those longer-term targets that you had, previously, you added the 3-plus percent service revenue and other growth for this year and 4-plus percent for next year, can you unpack the categories that are at or above the plan from a few years ago? And then the areas of shortfall and if those areas, do you view those as temporary or more permanent changes in the opportunity for Verizon? Okay. I can start. I mean, first of all, we're more confident than ever that we have the right strategy and we have the 5 vectors of growth. All of them are going along. Some are actually exceeding our expectations. Some are a little bit slower, and some have a little bit different jump-off points. That's where we are. But there's no difference how we see the market and how we believe we can compete in all the 5 vectors of growth that we outlined the last time. It's more a push in time than something else because of this year or this year, '22, I guess, I should say, had some jump-off that is not really helping us.  But all in all, the whole strategy, where we're going, I have a lot of confidence in our team. The team has a lot of confidence, and we're executing. We're eliminating the things that have been distracting us all the way from Verizon Media Group, et cetera.  Then we have some headwinds that we constantly work with as well that we don't talk so much about. On the wireline side, I talked about that today. I mean, everything from the cost out, but not only that. We're going to be even more prudent what type of business we're taking, which will reduce our top line probably. But it will improve our profitability and cash flow. So you're going to see us taking many actions to see that we are delivering on the plans -- the long-term plans, but there are some shifts in it. Matt? Yes. Thanks, Hans. So Mike, as you think about the conversation we had last year, and we talked about the long-term outlook, we provided the piece parts, maybe if I go through some of those and where we are. Some of them were absolutely where we expect it to be, think about nationwide broadband with the year we had on FWA, but also Fios and the expectation to continue to see very good progress there. That's very much in line with the expectations we outlined a year ago. Also, our business segment mobility results with 6 consecutive quarters above 150,000 net adds, very much in line with the expectations that we had at the Investor Day.  A couple of areas where we are behind versus our expectation at that point in time. Firstly, you take one of them, the mobile edge compute and 5G private networks, you're talking about the technology adoption there on a new technology, that adoption curve, a little slower than maybe we would have liked. But as you heard from Hans in the prepared remarks, heating up, we're starting to see some momentum there. So still feel good about the opportunity there. But the pace of the adoption curve, a little different than we hoped it might be. But the upside there still looks very good.  And then, of course, the other one, consumer mobility. At this time a year ago, we had higher expectations for '22 than where we ended up. Obviously, a lot of that variance occurred in the first part of the year, and you saw the actions taken. But as you think about the piece parts of the long-term outlook that we described a year ago and then how those have played out in the past 12 months, hopefully, that gives you a little more color in terms of where things are moving along very much in line and where we also saw some areas where we've had to -- we have opportunity to see further improvement as we go forward. The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Sorry, I hope you can hear me. So Hans, I wonder if you could just talk a bit about your bundling strategy, particularly on the consumer side. With both the strength now in fixed wireless but also Fios, is it your view that going forward, the consumer is going to buy wireless and wireline or fixed access together? Or is that more of a sort of a financial bundling strategy rather than a real product bundling strategy? Craig, no, I think it's a really good question. Of course, we have seen this as a very strong consumer movement in Europe that is, to a high degree, have convergence in the U.S., where, I would say, much lower. But clearly, it is something that our customers are asking for. So it's actually a consumer feedback. And I spent a lot of time in the stores, meeting a lot of our consumers. And they see a clear advantage to have the same provider on the broadband as on the wireless. I don't think we will get into any European levels. But clearly, this is a movement, and Verizon has a super good position here.  We have owners' economics on our broadband and on our wireless nationwide, both of them. And that's, of course -- we're going to meet the customers here. If the customer thinks that is what they need, we're going to offer it, and that's why we have these bundles in the market. If they want to have them separate, we can do that as well. We have owners' economics on both of them. But I think that trend will continue, given the consumer research we are doing and the consumers we are talking to. That's something that is actually -- and it's not only consumers. You need to think about small and medium business as well, make it convenient for them, both having the wireless and the broadband, because any SMB today, and we spend -- we probably serve half of the SMBs in the country, any SMB today need a digital front door and then being mobile first. So this is really good for us.  And if you look at our numbers this year on both on fixed wireless access and mobility in the business segment, SMB has been very important for us. So yes, I think there's something in there definitely, and it's a consumer desire. And we're going to meet that desire as we continue. And are there big differences between the way you think about it in Fios versus non-Fios markets? No. It's not different. We see it in the same way if the customer -- of course, we're much more mature historically in the Fios footprint. On the other side, when we do fixed wireless access, it's a much more natural discussion with the customer as we have it from the beginning. So I would say that we probably have a big opportunity on the Fios segment to have customers both on the fixed and the mobile.  On the fixed wireless access, I think that there, you start actually on a strong position when you start offering fixed wireless access with many of the customers sort of coming in either on a cable provider and have our wireless. And that's how they move over to us. The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Hans, when we think about the balance between unit growth versus pricing, and obviously, you have made the deliberate choice not to chase unit growth near term, but could you help us think through how you think about this longer term? Because once you cede market share, obviously, it can be pretty expensive to get it back. And so when we think about this balance between pricing and unit growth, how important is unit growth not just for short term as you look at 2023, but also longer term, especially when it comes to postpaid phone growth? Thank you. No, good question. I think that as you heard us at least, I mean, we think that the profitable growth is the most important, both to have the right customers retained with us and the ones we're getting. So that's an overarching measurement we need to have. Then, of course, it's always going to be new customers that are important for our base.  But remember also, this market right now, if you talk about the premium segment, there are, of course, a certain amount of switchers in the market, and then there are a certain amount of people going from pre to postpaid. There is no infusion of new customers in the system. So they're coming from 2 sources, and you need to think about how you do that. And I think we have great opportunities right now with the TracFone brands we have to see -- and Total wireless to see that we are taking care of that pre to post migration, which we've not been part of before. We still have some work with the IT stacks and all of that. But clearly, today, we are running on both sides.  And on the switcher pool, yes, there, we're going to be seeing that we're prudent and disciplined, but we will go for the units we think are the right. So -- but it's a subscription model long term that is even more important to increase the P sometimes than increasing the Q because this is long term that you stay with the customers to get the long-term value from them. But it's a balance of it all the time and that we will continue to have. The next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. You talked about amortization being up $1 billion for phone subsidies to catch up with cash spending. Embedded in all your guidance is cash spending at peak levels. Is there a scope for it still to go higher? I know it depends on the competitive environment that it could eventually improve. But are we at peak levels and it's just a question of amortization catching up? And I'm curious, when you think about the service revenue guide for wireless, are there any price increases anticipated in that guide and kind of what level of price increase? I know it's a sensitive topic, but just curious how we should think about that revenue growth. Thank you. Now if we talk about the price increases, I just want to come back to what I said before. I mean, we will be surgical and segmented in our approach. There are certain segments we need to be more aggressive on. There might be areas where we see opportunities for price increases. There are no major price increases included at this moment. We need to see where the market is going and also where cost levels are going, but we will always look at that. But there's nothing right now that we have in our plans. Matt? Yes. On the promotion piece, you've got the understanding of the accounting treatment versus the cash there, Doug. And certainly, our assumption is that the marketplace will continue to be competitive, but we're not going to go into 100% details of what's in the guide there. But we do assume that we'll continue to see competitive level in line with the past couple of years. And then as Hans said, we'll continue to look for ways to put plans in the marketplace that reduce the level of subsidy out there as well, and we'll continue to push for those opportunities. The next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Matt, can you talk about your goals for free cash flow? And specifically, how much do you think you can reduce the debt by -- per year kind of going forward at this point?  And then secondly, can you talk about the gating factor for fixed wireless growth? It seems like you're implying with your '25 guidance that this is kind of a good run rate, but yet your speeds are going to be increasing threefold and coverage, you're going to basically get a massive amount of capacity kind of going out there. But do you think this is a good run rate for fixed wireless or can it accelerate? I can start with fixed wireless access. First of all, we just reiterated what we said in Investor Day, 4 million to 5 million subscribers on fixed wireless access. Our job is always to try to beat that, but that was -- we just reiterated that, and we are well ahead on that plan.  Then the second is, of course, when it comes to our capacity, we have definitely capacity for that and much more. And again, we have a multi-usage of our network. That has been sort of the basis for this, meaning the same radio base stations are serving mobility, fixed wireless access and mobile edge compute. And we are not doing separate.  In the distant future, way above the 4 million and 5 million, we can always come into sort of decisions of splitting cells in order to get more fixed wireless access. But that's very far away from now. We have ample capacity for the guide and much more than that. So -- and of course, our team is doing everything to see that we can continue to exceed our targets. Tim, on the free cash flow question, so absolutely, one of our goals is to continue to grow cash flow. Hans mentioned that you should measure us on revenue growth, EBITDA growth and cash flow growth, and that cash flow growth is something we expect to be able to continue to generate going forward. Obviously, the capital reduction from the high point in '22 to the guide we gave for this year and then an even lower amount next year will be a positive towards that as we continue to obviously make progress on the income statement as well. You should see that contribute there as well. So that puts us in a position where we can start to see accelerated levels of debt reduction versus what you've seen in the past year or so. So that's the targets we have ahead of us and look forward to discussing progress against as we go forward here. The final question for today will come from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. I wanted to ask you about business postpaid phone net adds. They seem to be a bit lighter this quarter than they've been in the past 4 or 5 quarters. And I'm just wondering if you're seeing trends there soften due to macroeconomic factors such as corporate staff reductions or if it's competitive reasons. Or is it any slowdown in the secular trend toward company-issued devices? And then related to that, can you talk about what you're assuming in the guidance at a high level for the macroeconomic environment? For example, are you assuming a soft landing scenario with small macro impacts? Or are you baking in a more protracted downturn in the guidance? Thank you. Yes. So it's a multifaceted question on the fourth quarter. Of course, on the business-to-business side, SMBs continue to be very strong. And as I said, they need a storefront and a mobile-first strategy in today's world after COVID. So I think that's where we have been performing very well. On the enterprise side, it's a little bit different, but we see that bring your own device is going down. And we see more companies saying that they want the company phone, which is of course, helping us here. So -- and that we -- that trend we have seen for a couple of quarters. So I think both of them are pretty solid.  On the consumer side, as I said, we had positive net adds. We had also, as I said before, a little bit speed lower from the churn from the price increase at the beginning of the quarter. And then there was actually fewer days of sales in the fourth quarter than in a normal quarter. So I don't think there are any new things more than what I said. Customers were a little bit later in the holiday season to do. They had higher intent when it comes to consumers, but it was nothing macroeconomical different than I talked about. Matt and I talked about the bad debt and the delinquency being like pre-COVID or equal or better than pre-COVID. So no, there's nothing there. We are, of course, watching it. But so far, we continue to progress well. Yes. Just to add on a couple of points. So as you think about the VBG net adds, you're always going to see a little bit of volatility up and down from 1 quarter to the next just because of the size of some of the transactions there. So all in all, though, jobs numbers continue to be good. Business numbers, good. Obviously, there's been some high-profile layoff announcements, but overall job numbers are good. And you see that show up in the overall numbers that we produced throughout the year and look forward to continuing to have best-in-class market share within the Verizon Business Group space as we go forward.  In terms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the guide, I wouldn't say we have anything too dissimilar to what you've heard from a number of other people during earnings season. But one of the things I come back to is the resiliency of our customer base. We've been through different types of economic environments in the past. We know customers pay their phone bills before they pay other bills and other outgoings. We fully expect that to continue. And so we're obviously watching the macroeconomic environment. But as Hans said, the payment patterns continue to be very strong, and we'll stay close to that. But so far, so good. Thanks, Bryan. Brad, that's all the time we have today. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. Good morning. This is Jessica Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson. Welcome to our company's review of business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and our financial outlook for 2023.   Joining me on today's call are Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.   A few logistics before we get into the details. As a reminder, you can find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules, on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.   Please note that today's meeting may include forward-looking statements related to, among other things, the company's future financial performance, product development, market position and business strategy and the anticipated separation of the company's consumer health business. You're cautioned not to rely on these statements, which are based on current expectations of future events using the information available as of today's date and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.   In particular, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A further description of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K, which is available at investor.jnj.com and on the SEC's website.  Additionally, several of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships.   Moving to today's agenda. Joaquin will open with a few comments highlighting his first year as CEO and his priorities for 2023. I will then review the fourth quarter sales and P&L results for the corporation and highlights related to the 3 segments as well as full year 2022 results for the enterprise. Joe will then close with additional business commentary before sharing an overview of our cash position, our capital allocation priorities and our guidance for 2023. The remaining time will be available for your questions. We anticipate the webcast will last approximately 75 minutes.  I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin. Thanks, Jess. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to review our 2022 results and highlight my priorities for the business.   I'm excited for the future of Johnson & Johnson. For over 135 years, people have counted on Johnson & Johnson to be at the forefront of health care innovation. This remains as through today as the day we were founded, and I'm honored to continue this legacy.   In 2022, despite macroeconomic challenges, we delivered full year operational growth of over 6%. This is the result of the dedication and focus of our employees around the world as well as the breadth and diversification of our business.   There were many business achievements last year. Let me share some highlights. Our pharmaceutical team achieved its 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, delivering nearly 7% growth as we continue to advance our innovation pipeline.   I'm particularly excited about the progress made across our multiple myeloma portfolio. This includes the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy antibody, our BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody, along with the recent filing of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific.   In MedTech, we generated above 6% full year operational growth, anticipating our second consecutive year, outperforming our competitive composite. In terms of innovation, we accelerated the cadence of new product launches and significantly enhanced the quality of our MedTech pipeline, including more than doubling the number of programs with over $100 million of net present value potential.   Notably, we completed the acquisition of Abiomed, which positions us as the global leader in heart recovery and immediately enhances MedTech revenue growth. This transaction will become accretive to earnings in 2024.  Finally, we made significant progress towards the separation of Kenvue. We have begun operating our consumer business as a company within a company, and we filed our Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation.   Looking ahead, while we expect some of the headwinds that impacted 2022 to continue, we have proven that Johnson & Johnson is resilient in times of macroeconomic challenges. In this environment, our approach to 2023 can be best described as prudent, and our priorities for the year are clear and remain consistent.   First, we are finalizing our plans for Johnson & Johnson to operate as a 2-sector company, dedicated to competitive performance, both in Pharmaceutical and MedTech. This change will enable us to become simpler, faster and more focused.   In Pharmaceutical, we will continue delivering top line growth annually, while driving towards $60 billion in revenue by 2025. We believe we will be able to achieve our market growth in 2023 for the 12th consecutive year, even in the face of the STELARA loss of exclusivity and macroeconomic challenges.   Growth will be driven primarily by our existing portfolio, including DARZALEX, TREMFYA, ERLEADA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI and also continued uptake from new launches, including SPRAVATO, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI.   In MedTech, with the acquisition of Abiomed, we now have 12 platforms with over $1 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to build on 2022's momentum. We will do this by maximizing the commercial opportunity for recently launched innovations, continuing to advance the Abiomed pipeline and prioritizing investment in higher growth segments of our markets.  This will be a transformational year for Johnson & Johnson, which brings me to my next priority, completing the successful creation of a new consumer health company, Kenvue. We remain on track to complete the separation in 2023, as indicated in our initial announcement in November of 2021.   As we look forward, our track record gives us the confidence that we can grow ahead of our peers and cement the foundation for long-term success. Following 2021, a year where we substantially increased R&D investment, we continue our commitment to organic innovation. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D during 2022.   Also we increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year. We instituted a share repurchase, and we deployed over $17 billion in M&A, including the acquisition of Abiomed. Very few companies have the capability and the balance sheet to take such significant actions concurrently, especially in a year like 2022. I'm confident that we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond.   In closing, I am energized about what is to come. As the largest and most diversified health care product company in the world, we will continue to use our scale and breadth to drive innovations, deliver for patients and shape the future of health care around the world.   Now let me turn it back to Jess. Thanks, Joaquin.  Starting with Q4 2022 sales results. Worldwide sales were $23.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 4.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 0.9%, as currency had a negative impact of 5.3 points.   In the U.S., sales increased 2.9%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported sales declined 11.5%. Operational sales outside the U.S. declined 1.1%, with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 10.4 points.  Excluding sales from the COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales growth was 4.6% worldwide, 4.7% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedule, acquisitions and divestitures had an immaterial impact on our results in the quarter.   Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $3.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.70 one year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.35, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. On an operating basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15.5%.  For the full year 2022, consolidated sales were $94.9 billion, an increase of 1.3% compared to the full year of 2021. Operationally, full year sales grew 6.1%, with currency having a negative impact of 4.8 points. Sales growth in the U.S. was 3%.  In regions outside the U.S., our reported year-over-year sales declined 0.6%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. grew by 9.1%, with currency negatively impacted our reported OUS results by 9.7 points. As you will find in our supplemental sales schedules, acquisition and divestitures as well as sales from our COVID-19 vaccine had an immaterial impact on our results for the full year.   Net earnings for the full year 2022 were $17.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $6.73 versus diluted earnings per share of $7.81 a year ago. 2022 adjusted net earnings were $27 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.15, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6%, respectively, versus full year 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 9.2%.   While not part of our prepared remarks for today's call, we have provided additional information and backup for our full year 2022 sales by segment, consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted income before tax by segment, which can be downloaded from our website.   I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights for the quarter. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2021 and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.   Beginning with Consumer Health. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $3.8 billion increased 1%, with an increase of 10.9% in the U.S. and a decline of 5.8% outside the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 6.4%, and outside the U.S., operational sales growth increased 3.2%.  Results were primarily driven by strategic price increases, growth in OTC due to a strong cough, cold and flu season and growth in NEUTROGENA as well as strong new product introductions in Asia Pacific and Latin America. NEUTROGENA growth contributed to the second consecutive quarter of 5% operational growth for Skin Health Beauty. Growth across the portfolio was partially offset by continued, although reduced, supply constraints in the U.S., COVID-19 impacts in China, portfolio simplification and the suspension of personal care product sales in Russia.   Moving on to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.2 billion decreased 7.4%, with declines of 0.6% in the U.S. and 14.9% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales declined 2.5%, and outside the U.S. operational sales declined 4.5%.  Excluding the COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth increased 3.9%, U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.4%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 6%. Pharmaceutical growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, enabling us to continue to deliver above-market adjusted operational sales growth for the 11th consecutive year, including 7 assets with double-digit growth.   Growth was driven by DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA and TREMFYA and was partially offset by REMICADE and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales.  Within our Oncology business, DARZALEX and ERLEADA continued to drive strong sales growth, with increases of 33.9% and 48.6%, respectively. ZYTIGA sales declined 43.6% worldwide predominantly due to loss of exclusivity in Europe in September. IMBRUVICA sales declined 12.3% worldwide due to competitive pressures and a suppressed CLL market due to COVID-19. Despite competitive pressures, IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide.   In our immunology business, STELARA grew 6.2% driven by market growth and share gains in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with gains of 4 points and 5.4 points in the U.S., respectively, as well as a favorable prior period adjustment, impacting worldwide results by approximately 460 basis points. Results in the quarter were partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and rebating in the U.S. as well as austerity measures in Europe and shipment timing in Asia Pacific.   TREMFYA grew 12.5% driven by share gains in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with gains of 1.4 points and 2.9 points in the U.S., respectively, along with market growth. Q4 growth was partially offset by a net unfavorable prior period adjustment impacting worldwide results by approximately 1,150 basis points, unfavorable patient mix and a challenging prior year comparison.   Beginning in Q1 2023, we anticipate that CARVYKTI, currently reported in other oncology, and SPRAVATO, currently reported in other neuroscience, will meet the threshold to be separately disclosed.   I'll now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $6.8 billion decreased by 1.2%, with growth of 7.1% in the U.S. and a decline of 8.6% outside of the U.S. Excluding translational currency, worldwide operational sales growth increased 4.9%, and outside the U.S. operational sales growth increased 2.9%. Excluding the impact of acquisition and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 4.4%.  Q4 growth was driven by commercial execution, strong new product introduction performance as well as COVID-19 procedure recovery in many parts of the world. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of value-based procurement, COVID resurgence in China as well as supply constraints, predominantly in vision.   Strong growth continued in the U.S., with dollar sales sequentially improving each quarter throughout 2022. OUS performance was adversely impacted by dynamics related to COVID-19, especially given our strong position in China.  The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered another quarter of worldwide double-digit growth at 15.1% driven primarily by strong new product introductions, performance, commercial execution and continued market growth in electrophysiology. Abiomed sales are also reported in Interventional Solutions, and financial results were reflected as of December 22, the date the acquisition closed.   Contact lens global growth of 7.7% reflects strong performance of our ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products, including the recent launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, strong commercial execution and market appropriate price actions. Growth was tempered by continued supply challenges.   In the Orthopedics franchise, digital and enabling technologies reported in spine, sports and other continued to accelerate and drive pull-through sales in areas like hips and knees. For additional context, selling days had approximately a 60 basis point positive impact on results in the quarter.   Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold deleveraged by 70 basis points primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing related costs, unfavorable currency impact in the Pharmaceutical business, inflationary pressures as well as unfavorable mix with the enterprise, with a lower portion of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business.   Selling, marketing and administrative margins leveraged by 150 basis points. This represents a 9% reduction versus the prior year driven by phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year as well as proactive management of costs given the current inflationary environment.   We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 16.2% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was an 18.6% reduction versus the prior year driven primarily by phasing with higher spend earlier in the year.   Interest income was favorable to prior year by just over $100 million driven by higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. The other income and expense line was an expense of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to an expense of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily driven by onetime COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing related exit costs, higher consumer health separation related costs, higher costs related to the Abiomed acquisition and lower gains on securities.   As we announced in Q2 2022, we continue to have commitments and obligations related to the COVID-19 vaccine, including external manufacturing network exit cost and required clinical trial expenses associated with the company's modification of its COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements.   Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 2.1% in the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by more income in higher tax jurisdictions versus the prior year.  Additionally, the company benefited from onetime tax items in the fourth quarter of 2021 that did not repeat in the current year.  Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.2% versus 10.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2022 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax matters.   Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items.   Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 25.6% to 31.3%. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 33.9% to 38.2% primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, partially offset by the negative impact of currency and cost of products sold.   MedTech margins improved from 18.1% to 25.3% primarily driven by SG&A and R&D phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year, favorable portfolio mix and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.   Finally, Consumer Health margins improved from 18.6% to 22% driven by brand marketing phasing, with higher spend earlier in the year and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.   This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson & Johnson fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe? Thank you, Jess, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.   As Jess shared, we reported solid results with competitive growth across our business segments in 2022. While macroeconomic challenges and lingering COVID-19 related impacts tempered our fourth quarter sales growth, we prioritized our top investments, while managing costs to yield slightly better margin performance than guided in October to meet our earnings expectations. The business is resilient, and we should be positioned well entering 2023.  We are particularly proud of the advancements in our pipeline and portfolio to solidify the long term, including the launch of TECVAYLI, the filing of talquetamab in the U.S. and Europe, FDA clearance for our TELIGEN digital supply solution, the closing of the Abiomed acquisition and the tremendous progress made on separating our Consumer Health business.   Let's delve into the financials beginning with our 2022 year-end cash position and execution against our capital allocation priorities. We generated free cash flow for the year of approximately $17 billion. And at the end of 2022, we had approximately $24 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $40 billion of debt for a net debt position of $16 billion. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we had a strong year deploying capital against all of our capital allocation priorities. These priorities remain unchanged.   This past year, we invested more than 15% of sales for a total of nearly $15 billion in research and development. This investment has enabled the advancement of important programs, including strengthening our MedTech pipeline and progression of our multiple myeloma portfolio, which Joaquin referenced. Investment in R&D remains a top priority to support long-term growth and value creation.  Our second priority is our commitment to dividends. 2022 marked the 60th consecutive year in which we increased our annual dividend. We know investors value our dividend. And as a part of the Consumer Health separation, we intend, at a minimum, to maintain that dividend. As you can appreciate, we will need more clarity on the type of separation to determine how that is best achieved.  Our third priority is strategic acquisitions, which is intended to complement our organic activities. In 2022, we closed the acquisition of Abiomed, strengthening MedTech's presence in higher growth segments, as well as more than 100 smaller early-stage acquisitions, licensing deals and partnerships.   Finally, our Board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. And as of the end of the year, we've completed approximately 50% of that program. In combination with our dividend, we returned over $14 billion to shareholders in 2022.   I'll now provide our full year 2023 guidance. As we are still in the process of the Kenvue separation, our guidance represents the current Johnson & Johnson businesses, inclusive of Pharmaceuticals, MedTech and Consumer Health segments.  We expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% or $96.9 billion to $97.9 billion. This guidance is provided on a constant currency basis, reflecting how we manage business performance.  We estimate a favorable impact from net acquisitions and divestitures associated primarily with the Abiomed acquisition and, thus, are comfortable with your models reflecting adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%.   Our sales guidance continues to exclude contribution from the COVID-19 vaccine, which, as your models already correctly anticipate, will decline in 2023. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements, but utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08 as well as other currencies, we estimate there would be no impact from foreign currency translation on reported sales for the year.  Regarding other items on our P&L, we expect 2023 adjusted pretax operating margin to be flat driven by continued inflationary pressures and cost of goods sold, offset by continued operating expense leverage.  Regarding other income and expense, the line on the P&L where we record royalty income, the return on assets and actuarial costs associated with certain employee benefit programs as well as gains and losses related to items such as investments by Johnson & Johnson Development Corp., litigation and balance sheet write-offs. On an adjusted basis, we expect this to be $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion for 2023.  The majority of this income is associated with our employee benefits programs aligned with accounting disclosure requirements, rising interest rates, return on assets and program actions the team has implemented to derisk the plans have lowered our projected future benefit obligations. And based on current trends, we expect this benefit to continue through the next couple of years.   We are comfortable with you modeling net interest expense between $250 million and $350 million. These figures include increased financing charges versus 2022 and associated with the Abiomed acquisition.  Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2023 in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses.   Considering all these factors, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.60 on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth of approximately 2.5% to 4.5% or 3.5% at the mid.   While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted operational earnings per share for the year would be favorably impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, resulting in adjusted reported earnings per share in a range of $10.45 to $10.65 or $10.55 at the midpoint, a growth of 4% versus the prior year.   While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, I'd like to provide some qualitative considerations for your modeling. Some segment remarks to Pharmaceuticals. We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023 driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S.   While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe.   In MedTech, we expect continued competitive growth fueled by market recovery and continued commercial uptake of recently launched products. We anticipate a relatively stable recovery in procedure volumes, with health care staffing constraints remaining the most significant limitation on the pace of recovery.   Specific to China, we anticipate continued pressure into 2023 related to the easing of the zero-COVID policies as well as impacts from volume-based procurement. As we've said, we're excited about the Abiomed acquisition, which accelerates our sales growth in 2023.   In Consumer Health, we anticipate continued growth in line with the markets that we compete in. We also expect to continue to utilize strategic price increases across the portfolio to minimize the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures within the supply chain.  Regarding quarterly phasing, it's best summed up with a general theme that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, and likely the second quarter is stronger than the first quarter. We are assuming the following to support these statements.  In Pharmaceuticals, the first half of the year will be impacted by continued declines from LOE products in Europe that impacted Q4 2022 results, namely ZYTIGA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, as well as continued pricing pressure. Also we expect the ramp of new product launches will occur more prominently in the second half of the year.   In MedTech, we expect second half operational sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year, as we anticipate ongoing procedure recovery to improve as the year progresses. We also believe that some of the COVID impact felt in China in Q4 will carry over into early 2023. And similar to Pharmaceuticals, uptake of new product launches is assumed to be more pronounced in the second half.  Given we are in the registration process, regulations limit what we can currently discuss around the planned Consumer Health [ separation ].  On the P&L, we also anticipate operating margin to be better in the second half than the first half. This is attributable to inventory built in 2022 at higher costs driven by inflation that will flow through the P&L in the first half of 2023 and a second half that accounts for cost leverage driven by mitigation efforts and higher sales reflected in the comments I just made.   And finally, while we don't speculate on future currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at 1.08, as well as other currencies, foreign exchange would have a negative impact on our results in the first half of the year, but potentially a favorable impact in the second half.   Turning to key events in 2023. As mentioned, we are limited in the information we can provide around the planned Consumer Health separation. We publicly filed a Form S-1 on January 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, giving us the option to pursue an initial public offering as a potential first step in the planned separation, and we have started to operate Kenvue as a company within a company.   Consistent with our initial announcement in November of 2021, we continue to expect to complete the separation in 2023. And we expect that any interim steps, such as an IPO, would be consistent with that timing, subject to market conditions.  We are estimating $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion in after-tax Kenvue standup costs, with $1.2 billion having already been incurred through the end of 2022. These estimates are in line with industry average for transactions such as this one given Johnson & Johnson's market cap.   In terms of dis-synergies to be incurred following the completion of the separation, we are estimating between $500 million and $750 million of annual after-tax impact. We are already executing on plans to address these dis-synergies and expect to have them fully mitigated by the end 2024.   As we separate a new Johnson & Johnson, we'll also continue to reevaluate the level of ongoing financial information provided based on discussions with investors. While our financials will become simpler as we move from a 3-segment company to a 2-segment company, we will continue to look for ways to enhance our disclosures, such as providing quarterly R&D by segment and a patent expiry table in our Form 10-K.   We also expect 2023 to be an important year of scientific innovations and readouts across our segments. In our Pharmaceutical business, some examples include the potential approval of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; potential clinical data from CARTITUDE-4, a trial studying CARVYKTI or BCMA CAR-T in patients with 1 to 3 lines of prior therapy.   The potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations versus TAGRISSO as well as potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy.   Early clinical data from the Phase II SunRISe-1 study of TAR-200, our drug eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Starting Phase III clinical program for milvexian, a Factor XI anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Potential Phase II clinical data from nipocalimab, our FcRn antagonist in rheumatoid arthritis and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.  Potential Phase III clinical data from TREMFYA in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And finally, TREMFYA, our IL-23 inhibitor, was recently added to the National Reimbursement Drug list in China, which will take effect later this year.   In MedTech, we look forward to providing information on significant innovation programs across the business, including expansion of our digital solutions in orthopedics; our digital robotic solution, Ottava; our pulse field ablation solutions for cardiac ablation; and advancements in our pipeline and clinical studies for heart recovery associated with Abiomed.  Overall, our approach to 2023 financial guidance should be viewed as responsibly cautious given the many external uncertainties. We are focused on delivering competitive growth for the new Johnson & Johnson, while also completing a successful Consumer Health separation. We are confident that our current plans position us for long-term growth and value creation for shareholders.   That concludes our prepared remarks. I am now pleased to open the line for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Maybe a two-part question for me. I guess, Joe, first on the guidance, you mentioned it should be viewed as responsibly cautious. Just wondering any areas you'd call out in terms of conservatism as we think about the year. And then on the pipeline side, obviously, myeloma -- sorry, excuse me, myeloma, an important area for you guys. Just wondering if you can confirm the timing of the CARTITUDE-4 study and what you're hoping to see from that readout. Terence, I'll handle the first question, and then I'll kick the question of CARTITUDE over to Joaquin.  With respect to guidance, I would say, just given all the macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty, we thought this was the right approach at this point in time to come out with guidance in the ranges that we did. I wouldn't classify it as conservative per se. What I would say in terms of our outlook for the P&L is that we're assuming a lot of carryover, quite frankly, of the inflationary impact that we had in 2022.  As you can imagine, the way the accounting would work, we built the inventory at higher cost in 2022. That's set on the balance sheet at year-end and will flow through mostly the first half of 2023.  If there's any element of conservatism, I would say, it probably resides in the fact that we're not assuming any deflationary relief as we go throughout the year. So we do think these costs will be at a higher level for some time. But as you saw with our fourth quarter results, and really the outlook for 2023, we're doing everything we can responsibly to prioritize our top investments for the long term as well as manage costs in the interim. Thank you. And with respect to CARTITUDE-4 and CARVYKTI, our multiple myeloma portfolio trends is the most important driver of growth for our pharmaceutical group moving forward. It's about DARZALEX continued progression in first line, CARVYKTI, our best-in-class BCMA cell therapy, the recently approved TECVAYLI, our BCMA CD3 bispecific. And also we are excited about the filing of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific.  So all in all, this portfolio enables us to do something very significant, which is changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And we'll see these medicines being used in combination and in different sequences in order to achieve these treating to cure.  Specifically, what you mentioned, CARTITUDE-4, which is the study that evaluates CARVYKTI in patients who have received 1 or 3 prior lines of therapy, it's very important in achieving that goal. CARTITUDE-4 is an event-driven study, and we look forward to have some results of CARTITUDE-4 in 2023. We cannot give you the specific timing because it's an event-driven study, and it will be very important in our ambition to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Next question today is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities. So first of all, congratulations on the performance. I was hoping that you could please discuss the longer-term prospects for the Pharmaceutical business. In the past, J&J has targeted $60 billion in Pharmaceutical revenue in 2025.  I'm wondering if that's still the target. And if so, what you believe consensus is under modeling because consensus is projecting sales below the $60 billion figure for 2025. Thank you for the question. And turning to what you mentioned, our 2025 targets, we continue to work towards accomplishing our previously stated goals of, on one hand, delivering growth every single year in our pharmaceutical group through 2025, despite of the loss of exclusivity of STELARA. At the same time, continue to advance our differentiated pipeline and achieving $60 billion in revenue by 2025. So we continue to work towards these goals. As we have discussed multiple times, the growth by 2025 is going to be driven mainly through the strength of our currently marketed portfolio as well as new indications of niche marketed portfolio.  Some examples, continuous growth of DARZALEX in first line; TREMFYA, which is gaining share both in psoriatic arthritis and in psoriasis; and we expect a readout of our IBD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in 2023 will provide a significant additional leg of growth for TREMFYA.  ERLEADA, which is now in different indications in metastatic and nonmetastatic prostate cancer will have some readouts of studies in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2023, providing an additional leg of growth.  Our INVEGA SUSTENNA franchise in the U.S. as well as our pulmonary artery hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT that has been affected by COVID-19, but that we expect that will continue to deliver growth. So that is the mainstay of our growth prospects towards 2025, and I will go later about the disconnect.  Then connected with that, we are also excited about our new product launches, specifically growth of SPRAVATO, growth in CARVYKTI that I just mentioned before and also TECVAYLI, which we got the approval very recently. And as I commented, the filing of talquetamab, everything in multiple myeloma.  At the same time, we continue to make significant progress in some of the key products in our pipeline. Some of them, we commented that were opportunities of more than $5 billion. A sample of them, milvexian, our oral anticoagulant, the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in non-small cell lung cancer, our TARIS platform in bladder cancer. And finally, nipocalimab in autoantibody-mediated diseases. So those are the key drivers of our growth moving into 2025.  If I think about the main disconnect between our forecast and the Street forecast, it's our multiple myeloma portfolio. As I commented earlier, we see our multiple myeloma portfolio helping treating to cure rather than cannibalizing each other. And as a matter of fact, some of the studies that we have now in place show that ambition of combining our therapies.  I mentioned CARTITUDE-4, moving CARVYKTI into every lines of therapy. TECVAYLI and talquetamab, our 2 bispecific antibodies are being studied in combination with one another. And TECVAYLI or talquetamab are also being studied in combination with DARZALEX. So I see that as the major source of disconnect with the Street.  Then further to that, I continue to see disconnects in SPRAVATO, our treatment for treatment-resistant depression. Significant disconnects also in ERLEADA because of the indications in high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer that will read in 2023. We see a disconnect, as I commented in our pulmonary artery hypertension franchise with UPTRAVI and OPSUMIT, which have been impacted by the pandemic, but we see strong growth moving forward. And then finally, in the expectations for XARELTO loss of exclusivity, which we see that in the back half of this decade.  So those are elements that I have reflected as disconnect. So as I said, we continue to drive towards our 2025 goal of $60 billion and posting growth every year. I think it's a reflection of the strength of our current portfolio and how well we are executing in our pipeline. Next question today is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Just a 2-part one for me. Joe, can you provide a little more color on the cadence of operational sales growth in Pharma and Devices? How much lower do you expect the first half to be versus the second half? And what are you assuming for market growth in each of the segments in '23?  And Joaquin, just to follow up to David's question there on the $60 billion, it implies a 6% CAGR between 2022 and 2025. How should we think about the ramp to $60 billion? Do you expect it to be more back-end loaded? So let me start by -- as you know, we don't provide guidance by quarter, but let me talk a little bit about market growth. With respect to MedTech, we anticipate pretty much what we typically see in any given year of 4% to 6%. As some of my earlier comments in the prepared remarks reflect, we anticipate that there will be a little bit of, I'll call it, carryover from some of the COVID surges that we saw in the Asia Pacific region in the fourth quarter. But other than that, a normal cadence of steady procedure recovery.  The biggest challenge that hospital administrators are facing right now is really the staffing concern, but they've done a wonderful job in getting some sense of normalcy to that.  With respect to pharmaceuticals, again, we enjoyed our 11th consecutive year of above-market growth. We anticipate 2023 will be a 12th year, but it is off a lower base. If you happen to see some of the IQVIA data from last week, they're calling global and actually U.S. growth somewhere in that 2.5% to 4% range, depending on what region you're looking at. So while we will beat the market, we think it will be a lower number just by the dynamic of the market overall, and that's kind of how we're thinking of it.  In terms of some of the cadence, maybe to elaborate on the comments that I had prepared earlier, we will see some of that generic erosion that we experienced in the fourth quarter in Europe with the long-acting injectables as well as ZYTIGA having a much more pronounced impact in the first and second quarter, bleeding over from the fourth quarter. And pricing measures likely will be consistent throughout the year.  So hopefully, that helps give you a better sense of how we're looking at it. But again, the general theme of second half stronger than first half and probably second quarter stronger than first quarter seems to hold intact based on top line as well as bottom line performance given our expectations. Thank you. And regarding to your question, Larry, as we have discussed and commented, we see above-market growth in 2023 for our pharmaceutical group, which would be the 12th consecutive year of our market growth. And we continue to see positive growth in 2024, despite of the loss of exclusivity in STELARA. And then we would see again pickup of our growth above market in 2025. That's the sequence that we will see.  Certainly, the actual growth rate will be impacted by the FX, and we don't anticipate and we don't project FX. And when we were establishing our $60 billion goal, we were thinking about the FX at the moment. We don't change the $60 billion because we don't know what the FX would be by 2025. But for purposes of you understanding how we see that, we see above-market growth in 2023. We see positive growth in 2024, and then we see a pickup of growth, a significant one, in 2025 above market. Your next question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Just one question and one quick clarification. I guess, on operating margins, and this is a question maybe beyond '23, I'm just trying to think through the balance of, I guess, on one hand, some of the inflation headwinds potentially decreasing as you work through some of this inventory, I guess, balanced against the STELARA LOE and some of the dis-synergies from the spin.  So I guess, as something kind of bigger picture about operating margins, is 2023 a decent proxy going forward? Or could we see either modest erosion in margins or expansion? Or is it too early to call? I'm just trying to get some sense of how that plays out.  And then my second question, which is just maybe a clarification on some of the immunology comments you made regarding 4Q. I think you mentioned unfavorable mix and rebate dynamics as headwinds. Should we expect those dynamics to continue in '23? And I guess, are they getting worse? Or is this more just a continuation of what you've seen in the last few years that rebates are just kind of like gradually going up for that franchise as a whole? Great. Chris, I'll tackle the operating margin question, and then I'll turn it over to Joaquin for some of the immunology references. So with respect to operating margin, I think, while we don't give multiyear guidance, I think this year does portend to have considerable achievement in terms of managing cost by the organization, in addition to inflationary pressures. And again, that's not combated with an assumption that we'll see deflationary relief.  We also have the dis-synergies that come along with the consumer separation itself. As the comments indicated, we plan to address all of those, and we've already started in mid-2022 to mitigate some of those. They'll be fully mitigated by 2024. So I would think just looking out now qualitatively, '23 and '24 may look similar because you've got some different dynamics playing out, and we'll certainly have to see how inflation plays out over the course of this year.  And then getting back on a more normal cadence, I would say, you would expect from Johnson & Johnson, you know that we like to grow income a little bit faster than sales growth, and you do that by improving your margin profile.  We have $60 billion of resources in a given year. So we've got a responsibility, we think, to continue looking at our prioritization and our processes and technology to make sure that we are being not only as effective as we can be, but also as efficient as we can be. Thank you. And Chris, regarding the dynamics in the immunology market, overall, what we see is that the patient mix is changing, putting more pressure in our overall net price by having a higher participation of some channels we had lower priced. We see those situations continuing into 2023, but not getting worse. Simply, the situation that we are now will continue into 2023, but will stabilize from where we are. Our next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays. So I have just one on -- a follow-up on guidance. Joe, if you could talk a little bit about, following up on some of the conservatism and maybe the bright spots, the China assumptions that you've made for procedure disruption and maybe VBP. If you could give us a sense on how long into '23 you expect that to go and then what you assume for the STELARA LOE.  And then on the [indiscernible] that's a conservative side, on the bright spots, I think you just kind of covered, I guess, the ortho trends. I understand you aim at this mid-single-digit range for performance, but you had a very, very strong back half in the U.S. And I'm just wondering, does that kind of strength in ortho and the spine, for example, which is kind of well above sort of historical ranges, does that kind of continue into '23? Or are we assuming that we're going to get some comp challenges there? Or how -- what sort of elements are contemplated in your guidance? That would be helpful. Sure. Matt, first of all, I guess, let me follow up to Terence's question with respect to how he positioned the conservatism. I probably did miss an opportunity to speak about some of the things that maybe could go better on our behalf, and some of that could be a quicker rebound in China, whether that be in both MedTech or Pharmaceuticals.  Right now, we're assuming there is some carryover effect from the COVID surges we saw in the fourth quarter. The teams on the ground seem to indicate that it's still persistent, but if that rebounded a little bit quicker.  I think also looking at the multiple myeloma portfolio and the performance of CARVYKTI or TECVAYLI could be significant and opportunities or pockets for upside. We're obviously excited by the Abiomed acquisition and what that could possibly mean and bringing the capabilities of Johnson & Johnson, both in terms of scale and reach, presents some opportunity that maybe isn't in the current projections.  So there are some opportunities for outperformance. Right now, we like where the numbers at with respect to that. China and VBP specifically, I would say that is a dynamic that's not really a new phenomenon for us. We had won a number of tenders at the end of 2021 that were persistent throughout 2022, and we continue to win tenders.  And we think, over time, that the volume and the opportunity to help many more patients will be persistent with that. So we are -- it's part of the guidance that we see today, that we've offered today, but it's not really much more pronounced in terms of the impact it has on the business versus what we've experienced already. Next question today is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Just a question on STELARA erosion expectations. So I was hoping you can give us some thoughts about the cadence of biosimilar products that are going to be coming along this year. None are approved yet, but can we expect the first company to enter with exclusivity for 6 months, something we've seen with HUMIRA, and then the rest coming in '24? Or should we expect all the players to come at once? So any color on this patent dance would be helpful. Thank you for the question, and it's difficult for us to comment on some of your topics there. There's no approved biosimilars at this time, and we are going to continue to monitor the situation.  As we have commented, we expect the erosion curve of STELARA to be likely steeper than that of REMICADE given the evolution of the biosimilar market and the fact that STELARA is a self-administered product as well as potentially, to your point, potentially interchangeability in the label. So that's how we see the STELARA loss of exclusivity.  In 2023, when we think about the STELARA in the U.S., we see the sales of STELARA flat to declining, obviously, given the price pressures that will be offset also by continuous volume growth that we see in STELARA. So that's the perspective that we have for STELARA in 2023.  Overall, we have a very strong immunology franchise. I commented on TREMFYA before, the continuous progression in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the readout of our ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease studies, which is exciting. And also in 2023, we may have some data from our Phase II study of our oral IL-23, which we think it's a very exciting underappreciated opportunity in our pipeline, too. Next question today is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. The multiple myeloma franchise, obviously, very central to your objective for 2025. Between the CAR-T sort of gradual launch that you have based upon supply and the bispecifics, can you talk about what that interplay has been since the approval and launch and what you're expecting through the year in 2023? So as far as the demand for CARVYKTI, we see very strong demand for CARVYKTI and also for TECVAYLI. There's a significant need for new therapies in this relapsed/refractory patient population. So the demand for the products, the physicians and patient adoption has been really strong. So that is really encouraging and, importantly, the unmet medical need for these type of patients.  With CARVYKTI, we continue to scale our production capacity and expand our network of providers, and we are doing that in a phased approach.  With TECVAYLI, we are off to a successful start, and the early indications for this -- of the self-option are very, very positive, too, connected with the high unmet medical need that we see there.  Moving into 2023, key elements of that would be, from a data perspective, they're reading CARTITUDE-4, which would give us the opportunity to move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy. Also the filing of talquetamab, which will give us another line of therapy, because some of the studies of talquetamab are done in patients who have failed BCMA, either cell therapy or bispecifics. And the continuous data that we'll continue to provide to guide how to use this incredible portfolio in multiple myeloma. Sorry. Sorry, Kevin, we have time for one last question. Our final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. So wanted to ask you about the timing of data readouts first half or second half and your expectations for a few products. First one is nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. And then your oral IL-23, I saw that a trial was finished and what your next steps are here and when you might have some data. And then lastly, just on your RYBREVANT and lazertinib, are you still expecting a [indiscernible] interim readout for lung cancer here? So regarding the main data readouts that you could expect in 2023, I mean, I commented already on CARTITUDE-4, which is a key one for us. Again, this is an event-driven study, so it's difficult for us to give you an exact timing, Louise.  Importantly, we have the potential for an interim analysis of the MARIPOSA study, which is the study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations in this study versus TAGRISSO. And this is an important study for us.  And also we have the potential clinical data from the PAPILLON study, which is in frontline non-small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. So those are important ones in non-small cell lung cancer.  And then staying in oncology, we also have the data for the -- from the Phase II SunRISe-1 study of our TAR-200 platform, our drug-eluting device in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. And we continue to work on our high-risk localized prostate cancer with ERLEADA. So that's key elements in our oncology side.  As far as nipocalimab, we are expecting data from our Phase III studies in RA, in rheumatoid arthritis, which I know has created significant attention from you, and also in hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn. It will be towards the later part of the year. That's when you can expect those data to come up.  And then keeping with imported data reads next year, we'll also have the data reads in our 2 IBD studies, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease with TREMFYA.  Finally, important progress in our pipeline is that we will be starting our Phase III clinical program with milvexian, our Factor XI anticoagulant with our partners at Bristol-Myers Squibb. So I would say a very important year for us in terms of data read, that will also include our Phase II study of our oral IL-23. It's difficult for us to give you an exact time line, but we fully expect that to happen in 2023. So many important data reads for us that will showcase the good execution that we're having in our pipeline. Thank you, Louise, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those that we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any questions that you may have.  I would now like to turn it over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks. So thank you, everyone, for your questions and interests in Johnson & Johnson. While we have highlighted some of the challenges that we have in the macro environment, we think that 2023 is going to be another exciting year for innovation for patients, and you can rely on us on delivering strong financial performance for both the near and the long term.

         "Good Day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] My name is Liz, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Thanks, Liz. Welcome to GE's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Dybeck-Happe.  Keep in mind that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes.  As a reminder, GE completed the separation of our Healthcare business this month. GE Healthcare will report separately on January 30. So while included in our 2022 results, we're focusing today's commentary primarily on GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, our portfolio of energy businesses. Our remarks will also be simpler and shorter today, reflecting the company we are now, and we'll move more quickly to Q&A.  I'll now hand the call over to Larry. Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. 2022 marked the beginning of a new era for GE, following 4 years of strategic and operational transformation. We successfully separated GE Healthcare in a spin-off, distributing approximately 80% to GE shareholders on January 3. We strengthened our foundation, retiring an additional $11 billion of debt, bringing our total debt reduction over $100 billion since 2018. We continue to improve our operations, further embedding Lean and decentralization to better serve our customers. And today, excluding GE Healthcare Services -- which are both higher-margin and more resilient, represented an even larger part of our portfolio, about 60% of revenues and 85% of our backlog.  We finished the year strong, delivering revenue growth, margin expansion and better cash generation. GE Aerospace led the way as we executed on an unprecedented ramp. Within GE Vernova, Power delivered with continued stability at gas, and we took significant actions to position renewable energy for future profitability.  External catalysts like U.S. climate legislation and the European focus on accelerating electrification are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies. This progress has positioned us to create industry-leading investment-grade independent public companies.  Thanks to our team's high-quality work, our plans to launch GE Vernova and GE Aerospace are progressing well. We're filling key leadership positions for both, and we're preparing for 2 stand-alone businesses. We'll share more details with you, including our ongoing progress and time line for the planned GE Vernova spin, at our investor conference in March.   I could not be more proud of how the GE team managed through a challenging external environment to deliver for our customers and partners in 2022. My thanks to everyone.  And before I turn the call over to Carolina, a moment of reflection. Just 2 weeks ago, I, along with many of our leadership team, attended a memorial service for our exemplary GE Board member and former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter. Ash was a remarkable leader, incredibly humble and clear-headed. We miss him and his sage counsel.  Now Carolina will take you through our results. Thanks, Larry. Turning to Slide 3. I'll speak to the key drivers of our performance, I'll do it on an organic basis and including GE Healthcare.  In the fourth quarter, top line momentum continued as orders grew significantly across all segments. Revenue was up 11%, with services up 13%.  By segment. Revenue at Aerospace, Power and Healthcare was up double digits, driven by market demand, price realization and improving delivery. This was partially offset by Renewables largely due to lower volume resulting from U.S. PTC lapse and our heightened commercial selectivity. Adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points. Power was particularly robust, offsetting renewables. Overall, our price and cost-out actions outpaced inflation.  Revenue and profit growth resulted in over 50% EPS growth. Free cash flow was $4.3 billion, primarily driven by strong earnings and improving working capital. All accounts were a source of cash except receivables, which, as expected, was a use from revenue growth.   Moving to the full year. Orders were up 7%, with 22% growth in Aerospace and 13% growth in Power. Total services orders were up 12%, supporting profitable growth in 2023. Revenue was up 6%, largely driven, again, by aerospace, up 23%. More broadly, higher-margin services were up double digits, while total equipment revenue decreased 4%.  Collectively, supply chain headwinds and macro pressures impacted our performance by about 4 points. Importantly, margins, EPS and free cash flow all significantly improved year-over-year and finished in line or above the most recent outlook we shared in October.  Adjusted margin expanded 160 basis points, led by Aerospace and Power. Robust services growth, pricing, plus almost $1.5 billion of cost-out actions drove improvement. This was partially offset by inflationary pressures especially at our shorter-cycle businesses and pressure from Renewables.   Operating profit growth and debt reduction drove EPS up more than 50% for the full year. Free cash flow was $4.8 billion, up over $2 billion or over 80% improvement, driven by earnings and reduced debt. In 2022, working capital was a source of cash as accounts payable, progress collections and contract assets all contributed to the solid performance.   Now a moment on corporate. In 2021, we ended the year with $1.2 billion of costs. We continued to reduce costs in 2022, including a few hundred million dollars of market-driven favorability. We now have a smaller, leaner cost structure. And in 2023, we expect costs of about $600 million or roughly half of the 2021 sales line. Free cash flow, we expect to improve significantly given our progress with debt reduction and lower costs.   We continue to execute our restructuring plans and reduce our cost structure post the Healthcare spin, setting up fit-for-purpose, stand-alone structures for GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Stepping back, we're encouraged by our improved volume and pricing and our significant cost-out actions exiting the quarter. This will help us drive continued growth in 2023.  Now back to you, Larry, to discuss our businesses. Carolina, thank you. Starting with Aerospace. I'm 6 months in leading this business, and my conviction is even higher today that we have a premier franchise with highly differentiated product and technology positions and leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors.   Entering 2022, our priority was delivering on the significant growth across both engines and services, where stability and predictability are critically important for our customers. This starts with the right team. We have a balance of unparalleled experience and fresh perspective with nearly half our leaders new to their roles this year.   We're also driving 2 major operational changes. First is accelerating our progress with Lean to improve operating rigor and delivery. Take supply chain, where we've seen real improvements with more to come.  Our team in Terre Haute produces LEAP turbine center frames and started '22 with about 50 pieces delinquent. Working through multiple Kaizens, implementing flows, standard work and daily management, the team's Lean actions increased output over 20% and improved productivity by about 10%.  And today, they are on schedule. With our 2023 demand, we'll need to continue to use Lean in this way to deliver for our customers.  The second is decentralization. For example, in our Commercial Engines business, we're increasingly running our product lines as their own P&Ls, in line with how our customers work with us. More cross-functional collaboration in real time closer to the customer helps make us better.   Turning to the quarter. Both orders and revenue were up over 20%. Equipment orders were robust, now with almost 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. Commercial services and equipment revenue grew about 30%, and Military revenue was up about 20%, and services internal shop visits were up 25% and external part sales were up more than 20%. In equipment, commercial units were up nearly 30% with LEAP units up almost to 50%.  Looking sequentially, both internal shop visits and commercial units were about flat, but military units were up 10%. While material availability continues to be a challenge, our output across engines and services, we're using our Lean tools to help accelerate sequential improvement, a key for us this year.   Fourth quarter margins were above 18%, slightly better than we expected, although down year-over-year. Higher volume and price were more than offset by negative mix, driven by increased commercial equipment shipments, continued investment to support the business growth and other cost pressures. While still net price/cost positive, we expect inflation will continue to be challenging in 2023.   For the year, revenue was up 23%, driven by commercial sales with internal shop visits up over 20%. Profitability and cash were solid. Margins were 18.3%, up 440 basis points year-over-year. Services growth and positive price/cost more than offset the impact of increased investments and negative engine mix from higher LEAP deliveries. Free cash flow of $4.9 billion was driven by earnings and working capital. As we shared last quarter, total in-year AD&A flow came in close to 0 versus last year, $0.5 billion of pressure.   Looking ahead today, GE and CFM departures are close to 90% of '19 levels, and we expect to be back to '19 levels later this year. In '23, internal shop visits are expected to grow about 20% and external spare part sales are expected to increase. With Commercial Engines growing at about 20% and services at high teens to about 20%, plus Military growing at a high single-digit rate, we expect total Aerospace revenue to be in the mid- to high teens. And we expect LEAP engine deliveries to grow about 50% in '23. We also expect to deliver profit of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion and higher free cash flow. Aligned to current airframe or aircraft delivery schedules, AD&A is expected to be about $0.5 billion outflow in 2023.  We're laser-focused on supporting our air framers, airlines and lessors as they ramp post pandemic. Today, that means providing stability and predictability for our customers, keeping our current fleet flying and growing our new fleet, all the while continuing to invest in technologies that will define the future of flight.   Notably, we're encouraged by the momentum at Military with our next-generation technology, including the XA100 engine for the F-35. The XA100 offers cutting-edge capabilities needed to ensure continued U.S. air superiority. The adaptive engine transition program received a strong show of support recently from nearly 50 bipartisan members of Congress who wrote in support of continuing the program, which includes our engine, with $286 million of funding included in the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill.  Overall, GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with a bright future as a stand-alone industry leader.  Turning to the GE Vernova portfolio. Power delivered a solid performance this year, and we're making real progress running a similar strategy at Renewables. While the demand drop due to the PTC lapse significantly impacted our Renewables results in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act is a real game-changer for us and the industry going forward.  In fact, we began to see a rebound in demand this quarter with Renewables orders up 7%. Onshore orders in North America more than doubled, a very encouraging sign. But unlocking the full potential of the IRA will hinge on how quickly the administration moves through implementation.  Meanwhile, lower volumes and inflationary pressures continued to weigh on our performance. Fourth quarter revenue was down 13% due to onshore, and margins contracted as inflation and lower volumes offset pricing and productivity gains. Full year free cash flow declined over $0.5 billion due to lower earnings.  So while we await clarity on the IRA rules, Scott and the team are controlling the controllable, taking action. And we saw progress in that regard this quarter.  Grid, a business that lost close to $400 million in 2021, was profitable for the first quarter since 2018, reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts. Orders also grew significantly.  At onshore, we're executing a restructuring with our headcount decreasing almost 20% sequentially, which will deliver savings in 2023. Our strategic sourcing actions at onshore and our focus on reducing product variants will improve product costs despite continued inflationary pressures.  Across the businesses, orders and sales pricing continue to improve with our selectivity strategy yielding a more profitable backlog and pipeline. Service orders and revenues, excluding repower, grew. There's certainly more work to do and the next 6 months will remain challenging, but we're acting with urgency. In 2023, we expect mid-single-digit growth, significantly better profit and flat to improving free cash flow.  Taking it by the business. Onshore. We expect more than 50% orders growth in North America this year. And based on the orders we have in hand, we're confident of delivering over 2,000 units globally with North American volume more than doubling in the second half versus the first half of the year. We also expect a significant step-up in profit driven by lower warranty and related reserves, better price and restructuring benefits.  With this significant orders growth comes roughly $3 billion to $4 billion of cash down payments this year. This includes $0.5 billion of cash linked to large tech selects we've won which we expect to convert to orders later this year. These are strong customer commitments, but given the project size and complexity, timing could shift somewhat across quarters.  In offshore, we expect to more than double revenue from about $0.5 billion in 2022. However, our margins on the first tranche of Haliade-X projects will be challenging between typical new product margins and inflation, resulting in rising losses. Associated with the delivery growth and limited down payments, we also expect cash will be significantly pressured in 2023 in offshore, mostly a timing dynamic.  And at grid, given our robust orders growth, we expect continued growth. The actions we've taken on price are expected to offset inflation pressures, and we continue to make progress, including our small -- our smaller cost structure and productivity. Taken together, this will enable grid to deliver a modestly profitable year in 2023.  Overall, I'm confident we're seeing operating improvements throughout the year in Renewables. And key external catalysts, like the IRA, will help improve our longer-term economic profile here.  Moving to Power. We've significantly improved Power, which is demonstrated by our continued profit and cash growth. We're well positioned for continued services growth with our expanded HA fleet. To date, we've now shipped 110 HAs with roughly 80 units COD, providing a reliable source of cash growth in the future as our highest utilization assets in the fleet.  Looking at the quarter, Power demand remained robust, orders grew in all businesses and revenue was up double digits, largely driven by continued aeroderivative momentum at gas power. Services were also solid with orders and revenue up again driven by gas transactional services. Margins expanded over 700 basis points driven by significant gas volume, favorable price/cost and productivity gains. Similar to Aerospace, we expect inflation will remain challenging through 2023.  Moving to the full year, orders were up double digits. But importantly, we're not taking our eye off selectivity with disciplined underwriting. In line with our outlook, revenue was up low single digits, led by services. Margins expanded 300 basis points, enabling Power to achieve high single-digit margin for the year. And our free cash flow improved significantly across both gas and steam. At gas service, billings were strong as fleet utilization grew low single digits.  Looking to 2023 for Power. We expect low single-digit revenue growth driven by gas power services. Equipment revenue will grow as we deliver more HAs despite the new build wind down at steam. And we [Audio Gap] year-over-year. At gas, both equipment and services volume as well as productivity gains and price should help offset rising inflation pressure. We expect lower free cash flow year-over-year. Continued earnings growth and strong services collections are offset by disbursements, but we expect free cash flow conversion to remain solid.  Stepping back. Our existing technologies in the GE Vernova portfolio will play an important role in the energy transition. It's the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world, is the challenge that these businesses with their vast installed bases were made to meet.  Let's turn now to the overall GE outlook for 2023. We're expecting organic revenue growth in the high single-digit range; $1.60 to $2 for adjusted EPS, which includes about $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion of adjusted profit; and a range of $3.4 billion to $4.2 billion for free cash flow.  Underpinning this outlook is a higher services concentration in our portfolio as well as our confidence in the strength of GE Aerospace as the worldwide commercial aviation industry, airlines and airframers alike, continues its post-pandemic recovery. We also anticipate Military revenue growth, thus yielding significant profit growth for GE Aerospace in '23.  For GE Vernova, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth and profit of negative $600 million to negative $200 million, including improvement at both businesses. On cash, we expect flat to slight improvement. This is driven largely by better profitability and planned down payments in onshore, where timing could shift across quarters with some offset from offshore increasing deliveries.  Across GE, we expect continued operational improvements to deliver higher earnings and improved working capital management. In turn, this will help us drive higher free cash flow for GE in '23.  We're looking forward to sharing more during our March 9 Investor Conference at GE Aerospace in Cincinnati, by then hopefully, home of the Super Bowl champion Bengals, where you'll hear more detail from our leadership teams about both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. Please come see us.  To close on Slide 8, I hope you see what I see: Strong results, a simpler story and an exciting future.  At GE Aerospace, continuous improvement is our mantra, and our results reflect our team, our technology and our portfolio's unique positioning as the industry's largest and youngest fleet. At GE Vernova, Power is delivering solid earnings and cash, while we're setting up Renewables to drive longer-term profitable growth.  We're moving forward with our plans to launch 2 independent investment-grade industry leaders that are well positioned to create long-term growth as we shape the future of flight and lead the energy transition. And I'm confident that we'll unlock greater value for our customers and our shareholders in the year ahead.  Now we're ready for questions. Steve? Thanks, Larry. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please save any GE Healthcare questions until their earnings call next week. Liz, can you please open the line? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Congrats on executing the spin. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. Yes. So my question is really going to be focused on this free cash flow bridge for 2023. And specifically on the segments, I'm curious. You talked about Aviation free cash flow being up versus '22. I know that you threw out the $500 million impact in AD&A, but did the rest of GE Aviation free cash flow grow consistently with earnings in 2023?  And then my kind of second question on the segments is just around Renewables. And what are you anticipating for the large payments in the second half of the year, and what impact that has to the free cash flow in 2023? Okay, Joe. So a couple of questions. So let me start with the free cash flow guide for 2023 for the whole company. So if we look at our 2022 numbers that we just printed $4.8 billion. New jumping house point, excluding Healthcare, is $3.1 billion. So basically, we are assuming that, the midpoint of our guide, we will improve free cash flow with about $700 million.  And the majority of that comes from growing of profit. Midpoint is about $1.3 billion of improvement in ops profit. You add to that lower interest, a couple of hundred million of tailwinds and then some working capital improvement despite the high single-digit growth.  A couple of things that are partially offsetting that. The headwinds for AD&A that you mentioned, about $0.5 billion. We have a restructuring cash out as well as higher cash tax since we made more money. So taking all together, we expect earnings to be the biggest driver of the improvement. We'll continue to benefit from our working capital management. And overall, that's what leads us to have confidence in our total free cash flow guide.  You also asked about the segments specifically, and on Aerospace. So if you look at Aerospace, clearly, the improvement in profit is a big driver in Aerospace improved free cash flow. When it comes to working capital, mind you, what Larry said about the really strong growth that we're expecting to see. So of course, working capital will be pressured, receivables and also partly inventory, from that kind of growth. But we do expect that the combination of profit growth, working capital management will more than offset the AD&A headwind of $0.5 billion. So we will improve cash also for Aerospace.  And then if you look at the Vernova businesses. As Larry said, we basically expect it to be flat to slightly improving on cash as well. And here, you have Power would be slightly down while we expect Renewables to  improve. Down payments, Joe, that you were asking about. I think we said in our formal remarks that, that should be in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. Some of those are for orders as they progress and orders to come, many of which we have been selected for. But again, the timing here, until the IRS finalizes the rules, the tax rules for developers, could have a little bit of movement, and that's what we were trying to flag in the formal remarks. So it will be back-loaded in that regard, but we'll have much greater linearity in Aerospace, as Carolina suggested. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Larry, just wanted to follow up here on Renewables. It looks like there's some op profit improvement, not maybe all the way back to what folks were perhaps expecting. Just wondering if you could parse what's getting better, like selectivity or grid or price/cost, versus what's still kind of a more material headwind this year? No, I think if you look at Renewables, we think profitability will be significantly better. If I break it down. At grid, we're really encouraged by the improvements the team has put in place. I think that's what yielded the profitable quarter here in the fourth, but more importantly, sets them up to be profitable in 2023, right? This is a business that people had given up on a few years ago. And particularly in Europe, we've seen tremendous interest really across the grid portfolio in line with this accelerated electrification that's underway. So I think that's all good and they begin to contribute in the new year.  I think from an onshore perspective, a little to Joe's question a moment ago on cash, the same thing applies to profitability. I think the first half is going to continue to be challenged much in the way that 2022 has. But as we work our way through the year, we would expect to see volume. We'll see higher-quality volume as a function of that selectivity. And we can really see better pricing in our order book compared to our revenues, in our tech selects compared to our orders and in our pipeline. We've talked about that before. I think that really is a sign that the industry is transitioning in anticipation of the IRA to one where volumes may be -- capacity may be challenged by demand, and that will be good overall.  But there's a whole host of things that we need to do operationally. I think we talked in the last call about improving our producibility and the robustness of what we do in manufacturing. At the same time, we have taken some structural cost actions, really the only place in GE where that's the case with nearly 2,000 of our associates in transition here as we look to get the Renewables business, onshore in particular, in better shape for what lies ahead.  And then for offshore. Because we aren't going to double revenue, we're going to need to recognize the losses that go with the Haliade-X early on here.  So grid, much better. Onshore wind in transition. A bit of a timing dynamic with offshore. And you put that together, and that's really what gives you the Renewables guide for '23. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Just wanted to ask about cash flow sort of through the year, and also the uses of your cash. That's something maybe refreshing to talk about for the first time in a few years.  But on the cash flow through the year, when we think about the seasonality, I think you had sort of free cash was minus $900 million first quarter a year ago. How do you see the sort of the cash flow moving this year? It sounds like renewables may be a very big headwind in the first half and then swings in the second. So any color on the GE firm-wide free cash as we go through the year?  And then maybe more for Larry, sort of thoughts on capital deployment. There is starting to be some optionality now for GE partly because of the improving cash flow. It's mostly been debt reduction understandably for a few years. But maybe just help us understand your priorities on cash use. Julian, let me take the first part of that question on seasonality and on how we see that happening through the year in 2023. Maybe let me just start with the first quarter. We are expecting an EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 in the first quarter, so actually better linearity than we've seen before in 2022.  On cash, we still expect cash to be negative also in the first quarter. The new jumping off point is a negative $1.2 billion. So we expect it to be significantly better than that, but still negative as is typical for our seasonality.  And seasonality, in general, I would say we don't expect material changes to our seasonality. We are still sort of heavy second half loaded, both on revenue and profit and on cash, actually even more back-end loaded now that we are excluding Healthcare.  So expect lower volume in the first half and ramping in the second half. Sort of Renewables sequentially growing through the year, and for Aerospace sequentially growing through the year. Renewables, significant sort of first half to second half ramp. And Power, more the typical outage seasonality, where you'd see sort of large 2Q and even larger 4Q, and we also have the equipment deliveries in the second half.  But I would finish by saying that improving operational linearity is a key priority for us, and clearly more to do. Julian, I would say with respect to capital allocation, you're right. The boardroom conversations are fundamentally different than they were just a few years ago, right? We've now reduced our debt load by $100 billion. Really pleased with the way Healthcare has spun and has traded here. You can look at that effectively as a $30 billion dividend to shareholders.  So we have a lot of options. And I would say all options are on the table. However, job 1 remains: The completion of what we announced, the transformation back in November of '21, right? We want to make sure more than anything that we are setting up both Aerospace and Vernova in the way that we described them. So as we work through a number of, if you will, more tactical considerations, that overarching strategic objective will continue to be foremost in mind.  But no doubt about it, it's a different conversation and it's a much more enjoyable conversation to have than where we were back in '18 and '19. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Just a couple of questions, I think, on Vernova. First, I think there's a lot of sort of talk in the industry about -- on wind to structurally change the contract, right, because overall industry is just not in particularly good shape.  So question one, where are we in conversations with large customers who seem to want more capacity, yet sort of the contract terms are not really helping the industry make any money? Where are we in structurally renegotiating the contract structure?  And I had the second question just on Power overall, more traditional Power. But focus is on profit growth, not revenue growth. What are the key levers you will focus in '23? Guidance seems to suggest modest margin expansion. Are there any headwinds in gas and services that you're facing in '23? Andrew, I'll take the first part of that. Carolina perhaps can jump in on the second part. I would say that you see, I think, in the press, more discussion offshore than you do onshore relative to renegotiation, given that some of the PPAs that are in place in the wake of the inflation that has run over every part of our economy, makes those more challenging arrangements. We're just really starting in our offshore business. So we see a little bit of that, but frankly, not a lot given our relatively small position.  I think the way you see those dynamics playing out for us, again, in the wake of the IRA in particular here in the U.S., is that customers really want what we refer to as workhorse products. I think the technical specmanship, the arms race, is a thing that is quickly -- a dynamic that's quickly fading here. And customers want to make sure that they know they can get units, onshore in particular, over the next several years that they can count on, both in terms of performance and delivery.  And I think that, in turn, is leading not to renegotiations. That's not the nature of the business. But as we look at new business, right, the reason we're seeing better pricing. I think that the industry is going to need to work through that so that there will be a new equilibrium. The carrots offered by the IRA are incredibly helpful in that regard, at least we anticipate that they will be once the IRS rules are finalized. And that, in turn, is why I think you'll see us step up in volume over the next several years and presumably convert these better as-sold price levels into real margins and real cash. From the Power, I have to just start by saying, looking at where we landed the year and what the team delivered, $1.2 billion of profit and 7.5% of op margin, really getting to high single digits, that's quite an achievement. And building on that for 2023, for Power, we have a couple of positives.  We have more CSA outages. We talked about '22 being a low CSA outage year, '23 will be higher CSA outage year, so that's good. We also have aeroderivatives growing. But we do expect to have a tough mix equation with equipment deliveries as well as inflation.  So price/cost for Power, having had a big price impact in 2022, when you lap that in 2023, being pressured by the inflation coming through in the P&L being such a long-cycle business. So overall, we expect earnings growth; and on the cash side, also strong services collections; but offset by distribution. So down slightly on the cash side, but still a very high cash conversion number. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Can you hear me? We can. Go ahead, Nigel. Just went -- my line just went dead there. First of all, thanks for all the details. We've covered a lot of ground so far. I did want to go back to the offshore losses and cash outflow in '23. Just wondering, how do you see that curve developing? I don't know if you want to quantify it in '23 in terms of the headwinds it's facing. But how do you see that progressing in '24 to '25? And maybe just given the magnitude of the losses in '23 for Renewables in total, are we still confident in the bridge back to '24 profit? Nigel, I don't know if we got all of that. Let me speak to the offshore dynamic. I think what we're going to see in '23 is pressure. We talked a little bit earlier about the doubling of revenue, the dynamics with the Haliade-X being new and how that rev rec will lead to op profit pressure.  From a cash dynamic, we'll also see disbursements as those projects move forward. We should see some milestone payments, some of which will be back-end loaded as well, and they too have a little bit of timing variability around them. We need to execute in order to see that in '23 as opposed to '24.  But as we look forward, I think what we've gotten from customers is a lot of good feedback relative to where we go next with the evolution of the Haliade-X. And that's where our product teams and our engineering teams are focused. I think the timing of when we see the next tranche of orders is such that it's going to be potentially more a '24 than a late '23 dynamic. And that, too, will create some of that pressure that is not atypical for a business that is effectively in startup mode.  I wish it were otherwise, but again, I think given what we're seeing in grid and what we should see in onshore, once we have clarity with the IRA, that will help buffet us in many respects. But when you look at Vernova overall, for that free cash flat to slightly improving guide, that's really what we're referring to.  I think with respect to [indiscernible], really no change in expectation, right? Again, if we get the volume that I think everyone anticipates coming here in the North American market, our best market, where we're seeing healthier pricing, coupled with better execution from a manufacturing, from a cost perspective; grid being profitable; and onshore -- or offshore rather, coming along, we should do that in '24. We need to do that next year. And when you see that cash -- that profit will then turn into cash, and then also the timing that we've talked about on working capital with the progress down payments, and more of that happening in 2024. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Just sort of a multi-parter for me, if I could, I'm sorry. But just first on Renewables. I just do want to confirm that the free cash flow guide includes the expectation of this $3 billion to $4 billion of payments. But my larger question is really how we think about normal conversion going forward. Kind of the implied free cash flow conversion on the guide here today for '23 is 180%, 190%, 200% or so relative to net income, right? So how do we expect that to normalize over time?  And maybe you could provide just a little bit more color on that bridge from net income to free cash flow. Carolina, you started walking us through the delta a little bit, but still just kind of that absolute difference between the 2 would be interesting to bridge. Sure, Jeff. So to start with, you are right. As Larry mentioned earlier this morning, in our guide for Renewables, we are expecting the $3 billion to $4 billion of payments in the free cash flow.  When we talk about free cash flow conversion, and you know me, always talk about cash, but it's important to see where it comes from. So broadly speaking, we do expect to operate at more than 100% free cash flow conversion for the next few years. And why is that? A couple of different parts.  First part, depreciation and amortization being higher than CapEx. And then I'll talk more about the working capital opportunities and timing as well. But with the depreciation and amortization, an important distinction. We expect depreciation to be largely in line with the CapEx to basically continue to invest. It's really the amortization that makes the difference. And now that we are excluding Healthcare, it's about $600 million of difference, and we would expect that to continue for years.  And on working capital, I would say there are a couple of different parts here. We do continue to see opportunities in improving our working capital management, especially after the year with the pressure that we've seen on the supply chain. So we see opportunities both to improve DSO and inventory turns, so on receivables and inventory. But also when we look at progress and contract assets, we expect both to be sources given where we are in the cycle.  Finally on AD&A. It's not working capital, but it's also a driver. And this year, we're expecting negative $0.5 billion of flow. And we've had a couple of years with positive flow from AD&A. So for the next couple of years, you can expect that to be pressured. But over time, we would also see that normalizing.  So overall, we do see opportunity to continue to improve, and we'll continue to work that. But for now, we're focused on growing earnings. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. I wanted to turn the conversation over to the Aerospace business, and specifically margins. And I understand the general flat-lining of margins in 2023, given the mix towards equipment. But I guess my question is, how long should we expect these mix headwinds to persist? Should we model margins higher coming out of 2023? And is there anything keeping the segment  from returning to the 21% level achieved in 2018, 2019? Well, we're delighted to talk about Aerospace, so let me jump in. We had a very strong finish, as you saw margins up to nearly 19%. But Chris, as you know, this LEAP dynamic, and frankly, mix overall, will be a pressure for us in '23. I think as we look at margins next year -- rather this year, we would expect they would be flat, but the revenue growth will give us an opportunity to drive profit growth up, call it, 15%.  I'd call out 2 things in '23. One, we do expect new units to grow more rapidly than services, that's a headwind in and of itself. And then the LEAP dynamic, both within services and within new units, will create the mix pressure that I suspect will remind folks about it through the course of the year.  That said, I don't think we look at 18% as some sort of ceiling that we cannot pierce. We continue to have, I think, a lot of optimism about the LEAP program and the opportunity to improve margins both with new units and in the aftermarket as we go forward. Program is still very much a young one.  I think at the same time, we know price/cost hasn't been as challenging, but it has been challenging at Aerospace. We'll do a better job, I'm sure, as we go forward. And our Lean efforts, I think very much, is in its infancy. You'll see that both in the P&L and I think in the cash flow statement.  So I don't think this is necessarily a '23 and done dynamic. That said, our expectations would be, as we go forward, all in to continue to drive top line growth, profit dollar growth and margin expansion at Aerospace. Liz, we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. First is a follow-up to Jeff's free cash flow question. Larry, when you joined GE, you talked about an initiative to kind of smooth out the free cash flow cadence for the year, trying to avoid that historical hockey stick. And look, there's still some seasonal impacts you can't get away from, like scheduled outages, that will impact the fourth quarter. But has there been progress? Is that still something that's an initiative here in terms of smoothing out free cash flow? And then I had a follow-up macro question. Deane, I would say that there has been progress, there's still a lot more to do. And we talk about it, when you hear us use the word linearity, right, it gets back to Lean 101. We just want to make every hour of every day count, every day of every week, every week of every month. And there's still a bit of a dynamic, some of this is us, some of this is our customers, where we migrate toward quarter end, we migrate toward year-end.  So I'm encouraged by the progress, and I think more people today understand how we can be more linear. If you look at just the reviews we've had the first 3 weeks of this year at Aerospace, right? We're looking at how we have started this year, how we've started this month vis-a-vis December, vis-a-vis January a year ago. Those are the sort of operating cadences which really help us in that regard. So pleased, but we're not done. Appreciate that. And then just given the uncertain macro, can you cite any changes, any meaningful changes in demand indicators that you're looking at, whether it's quote activity, front log, anything that you could share here this morning? Well, we're looking at just about everything that we can. Obviously, in Aerospace, we're watching not only departures, bookings and everything that can precede that. The only thing that we have seen, and this isn't a proprietary view, Deane, is obviously, freight has softened here as the short-cycle economy has done the same.  I think with respect to for Vernova, we look at utilization in gas and when we can see what's happening in real time. Even in Europe, we've been encouraged, I think, by the utilization of the gas fleet. That said, we don't want to suggest that we're immune. With 60% of revenue now in services tied to those real-time dynamics, we're watching carefully, but we wouldn't be guiding a high single-digit top line number this year if we weren't confident that our positioning both with the Aerospace recovery and the energy transition sets us up to do well here in '23. Larry, any final comments? Steve, we've covered a lot of ground here this morning. I would just wrap up with the group, saying that 2023 really, I think, was a historic year -- or '22 rather, was a historic year for us. We finished very strongly. The plans -- the spins are advancing. We couldn't be, I think, more thrilled with how things have played out for Healthcare. But more importantly, we're excited about what lies ahead.  Certainly appreciate everybody taking the time today to join us, your interest in our company and your investment in GE. And again, we hope to see many of you in March in Cincinnati. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, January 24, 2023.  I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M. Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions.   Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the home page of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.  Please turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.  Please turn to Slide 3. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.  Before I hand the call over to Mike, I would like to take a moment and highlight the financial reporting change we are making starting here in Q1 2023. As we announced in our press release on December 20, we'll be exiting PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, we have decided to provide additional disclosure by expanding the scope of our non-GAAP measurement adjustments to include the exit of PFAS manufacturing.  For 2022, we have treated the Q4 PFAS manufacturing exit cost as a special item in arriving at results adjusted for special items. However, beginning in 2023, we will expand the existing adjustment for special items to also adjust for the sales and estimate of income and associated activity of PFAS manufacturing. Therefore, our outlook for 2023 reflects this adjustment. Today's press release, press release attachments and slide presentation provide the information regarding our 2022 performance on our existing Q4 2022 non-GAAP basis, along with some comparative information on the new 2023 outlook basis. We will be providing a Form 8-K during the first quarter to reflect additional effects of this change in our non-GAAP measures and changes in segment reporting. We remain committed to providing strong transparency in reporting our financial performance. And of course, we are always here to address your questions.  With that, please turn to Slide 4, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike? Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We continue to focus on delivering for our customers and shareholders in a challenging economic environment with slowing growth, inflation and supply chain disruptions.   We posted organic growth of 0.4% versus our expectation of 1% to 3%, along with adjusted margins of 19% and adjusted earnings of $2.28 per share. The slower-than-expected growth was due to rapid declines in consumer-facing markets such as consumer electronics and retail, a dynamic that accelerated in December as consumers sharply cut discretionary spending and retailers adjusted inventory levels.   We also saw a significant slowing in China due to COVID-related disruptions, along with moderating demand across industrial markets. As demand weakened, we took actions to adjust manufacturing output and control costs, which enabled us to deliver a $250 million inventory improvement. In addition to actions taken in the second half of last year, today, we announced restructuring in our manufacturing operations, as we expect the demand trends that we saw in December to extend through the first half of 2023. I will discuss this more later in the call.  With supply chain stabilizing, we are focused on improving manufacturing operations and driving working capital. These are our most significant opportunities to improve margins and cash flow. As we navigate the external environment, we continue to position 3M for the future by investing in growth, productivity and sustainability.  I will recap 2022 and our outlook for 2023 after Monish takes you through the quarter. Monish? Thank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As you will recall, we highlighted negative trends in our consumer retail and electronics-related businesses in late November. As the fourth quarter progressed, those trends accelerated. We also experienced significant slowing in China as COVID-related impacts resulted in a 17% decline in organic sales in December, and down 8% for the quarter. Health Care continued to be challenged in its recovery to pre-pandemic levels, given labor shortages and hospital budgets being under pressure, while industrial end markets mostly remain steady.  Fourth quarter total sales were $8.1 billion or down 6.2% year-on-year, which included headwinds from foreign currency translation of minus 5% [ or ] $400 million which is better than the minus 7% we had expected.   We also experienced a 1.6% decline from divestitures or nearly $140 million largely from the third quarter divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies.  On an organic basis, fourth quarter sales increased 0.4% versus last year. This result included an anticipated falloff in disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia. These 2 items, combined, negatively impacted organic sales growth by approximately $230 million or 2.6 percentage points. Excluding this decline, Q4 organic sales growth was 3%. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter operating income was $1.5 billion, with operating margins of 19.1%. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.28 versus $2.45 last year.  Turning to the components that impacted fourth quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. We took a number of actions to navigate the fluid and slowing macroeconomic environment, including managing selling prices to address inflationary pressures, reducing manufacturing output, maintaining strong spending discipline and taking additional restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end market demand.  These actions delivered an underlying benefit to operating margins of 110 basis points and $0.19 to earnings. This helped more than offset headwinds from the sales decline in disposable respirators and Russia exit, which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and earnings by $0.15 per share.   Inflation continues to impact raw material, logistics and energy costs. These pressures remain persistent and are broad-based. In Q4, raw material cost increased approximately $110 million or a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points to operating margins and $0.16 to earnings.   As mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 5% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of $0.10 to earnings per share, however, was a benefit of 10 basis points to margins. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-over-year headwind of $0.04 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.09 per share year-over-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate.  Please turn to Slide 6. Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, with conversion of 131%, up 18 percentage points versus last year's Q4. During the quarter, we aggressively adjusted manufacturing production levels to end market trends, which drove a sequential reduction in inventory levels by $250 million. For the full year, adjusted free cash flow was $4.7 billion with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 82%. Capital expenditures were $506 million in the quarter and $1.75 billion for the year, or up 9% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. Looking to 2023, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing.   During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of cash dividends of $820 million and share repurchases of $540 million. For the year, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders, including $3.4 billion in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases.   In addition, we reduced our outstanding share count by 16 million shares via an exchange offer associated with the Food Safety divestiture. Having a strong balance sheet and capital structure remains a priority for 3M because of the flexibility it provides. Net debt at the end of Q4 stood at $12 billion, down 4% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.4x.  Please turn to Slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion or up 1.3% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $165 million due to the ongoing decline in demand for disposable respirators. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial grew Q4 organic sales by 7.5%. Our Personal Safety business declined mid-single digits organically, primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Turning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth was led by low double-digit increases in electrical markets, automotive aftermarket and abrasives. Industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking systems both declined low single digits.   Operationally, the Safety and Industrial stream drove strong execution during the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $611 million or up 9% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.4%, up 2.7 percentage points as the team managed inflation with price actions, drove yield and efficiency and exercise strong spending discipline while also investing in the business.   Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $2.1 billion or up 1.4% organically. Our auto OEM business increased mid-teens versus a 2% increase in global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms while also benefiting from a favorable comparison due to last year's Q4 channel inventory drawdown.   Our electronics business declined 10% organically as it continued to be impacted by the significant end market weakness, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs.  Turning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced materials grew organically low double digits, while both commercial solutions and transportation safety increased low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $366 million in adjusted operating income, down 3% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 17.8%, up 60 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team was able to more than offset manufacturing productivity headwinds and inflationary pressures with ongoing benefits from pricing, along with strong spending discipline and restructuring actions while investing in the business.   Looking at our Healthcare business, Q4 sales were $2 billion, with organic growth of 1.9% versus last year. Sales in our medical solutions business declined low single digits organically. Fourth quarter elective health care procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. Oral care was up low single digits despite decreased consumer spending on discretionary items. And finally, separation and purification organic sales increased high single digits while Health Information Systems was up mid-single digits.  Health Care's fourth quarter operating income was $421 million, down 18% year-on-year.  Operating margins were 20.6%, down 2.9 percentage points, with adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 29%. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by manufacturing productivity headwinds, increased raw materials and logistics costs, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by pricing actions along with the strong spending discipline.  Lastly, our Consumer business posted fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 5.7% year-on-year with particular weakness in the U.S., which was down high single digits. All businesses declined organically as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending and retailers aggressively took actions to reduce their inventories, particularly in the U.S.   Looking ahead, we anticipate those trends to continue at least through the first half of 2023. Consumer's fourth quarter operating income was $224 million, down 24% compared to last year, with operating margins of 17.9%, down 3.3 percentage points year-on-year.   This year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by increased end market weakness, higher raw materials and logistics and outsourced hard goods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, along with investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by selling price actions and strong spending discipline.  I'll now turn it back over to Mike for a recap of our full year 2022 performance. Please turn to Slide 9. Thank you, Monish. 2022 was a pivotal year for 3M. Throughout the year, we took decisive actions that are foundational to our future and at the same time, maintained our focus on our customers. We addressed inflation through selling price actions and proactively managed cost as demand softened throughout the year.  To address supply chain disruptions, we did what was necessary to serve customers and reduce cycle times, including opening a new distribution center on the East Coast. We navigated COVID-related lockdowns in China. We reached agreement with the Flemish government to restart operations in Zwijndrecht and exited our Russia business.  As always, we put 3M science to work to solve customer needs across our market-leading businesses. In Safety and Industrial, our new robotic paint repair system received multiple prestigious honors as we continue to drive innovation in automotive manufacturing, an area we led in for more than 100 years.  In Consumer, we launched Scotch Cushion Lock, a sustainable alternative to plastic wrap, which was recognized by Fast Company as one of its world-changing ideas. In Health Care, we advanced our leadership in wound care, which includes our negative pressure wound therapies, becoming the first solution of its kind to surpass 2,000 peer-reviewed studies.  In Transportation and Electronics, we introduced new thermal barrier films to improve performance of electric car batteries, one element of our $0.5 billion automotive electrification platform, which delivered 30% organic growth in 2022. Company-wide, for the total year, we delivered organic growth of 1% or 3% excluding the impact of disposable respirators and our Russia exit.  We posted adjusted EPS of $10.10, along with adjusted free cash flow of $4.7 billion, with an adjusted conversion rate of 82%. We strengthened our balance sheet and reduced net debt by $0.5 billion, ending 2022 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4. This enabled us to invest in the business and returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, we took actions to position us for the long term. We divested our Food Safety business, receiving $1 billion and reducing our outstanding share count by 16 million. We continue to progress in our health care spin-off, which will create 2 world-class public companies better positioned to drive growth and value creation.  With respect to combat arms litigation, as last week's report from the Chapter 11 comediators indicated, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies in this ongoing confidential mediation process. We continue to address PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate.  We also announced we will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. Our decision is based on careful consideration of the external landscape, including regulatory trends and changing stakeholder expectations. We simplified and streamlined our supply chain organization and advanced our digital strategies to better serve customers. We followed through on our sustainability commitments. We are ahead of schedule installing state-of-the-art filtration technologies and factories around the world. We now have capabilities up and running at all 3 of our largest water using sites in the U.S. and in Zwijndrecht.  We supported employee health, safety and well-being, including new flexible work arrangements and factory investments and we advanced diversity, equity and inclusion, with each of our business groups now executing initiatives. The steps we took in 2022 and the steps we are continuing to take in 2023, position us well as we look toward the future.  Please turn to Slide 11. We expect market and macroeconomic challenges to persist in 2023. Based on this outlook, we expect organic growth of minus 3% to flat, along with adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $9, and adjusted free cash flow conversion of 90% to 100%.  Our expectations reflect the slowing in demand we are seeing as we start 2023. Supply chains are improving. However, we still see headwinds from material availability and inflation, albeit at a lower level. We are not satisfied with our progress or performance. We are taking additional actions, building on the actions taken in the second half of 2022 to reduce cost, structure and inventory.  We have implemented strict control of hiring and discretionary spending. Today, we announced that we will reduce approximately 2,500 global manufacturing roles, a necessary decision to further align with adjusted production volumes. In addition to the actions we are taking to respond to the macroeconomic environment, we are taking a deeper look at everything we do as we prepare for the Health Care spin.  As we move through the year, we will take additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us even closer to our customers. At the same time, we win in the market because we stay close to customers and continue to invest in innovation even in the most difficult times.  We will continue to invest in growth opportunities in our businesses, aligned to global trends that take best advantage of our innovation. Automotive electrification, industrial automation, biopharma processing and home improvement are just a few examples of large, fast-growing markets where we are investing and where 3M innovation can make a difference.  We will continue to prepare for the spin-off of our Health Care business, which presents a tremendous value creation opportunity while at the same time, preparing 3M for future success. We will work to resolve litigation we face following through on the actions we initiated in 2022.  Underpinning all of our work will be the strengths of 3M, our people, our industry-leading innovation, our advanced manufacturing, our global capabilities and our iconic brands. I am confident in our future as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M.  Monish will now cover the details of our outlook. Monish? Thank you, Mike. Please turn to Slide 12. The macroeconomic environment remains very fluid and uncertain. For 2023, we anticipate that GDP and IPI will continue to moderate with both currently estimated to be around 1.5% or about half of 2022 levels. Therefore, against this backdrop, we feel it prudent to set our expectations to reflect this reality. . As Mike mentioned, we estimate our full year adjusted organic sales growth to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This includes selling prices up low single digits Therefore, organic volumes are expected to be down low to mid-single digits for the year. This range also includes an estimated 2 percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. We currently expect our disposable respirator demand to be down to pre-pandemic levels.  As the strength of the U.S. dollar carries into 2023, we estimate a foreign currency translation impact to sales of minus 1% to minus 2%. And divestitures that were completed in 2022 will be a headwind to sales of nearly 1 percentage point. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. This range includes a combined earnings headwind of $0.55 to $0.80 per share year-on-year from the following 3 items. First, the expected sales decline of disposable respirators and exit of Russia will be an impact of minus $0.30 to minus $0.45. Second, foreign currency will be a headwind of minus $0.10 to $0.20. And third, divestiture impacts would be a minus $0.15.  In addition, the 2022 carryover impact of higher raw material and logistics costs, combined with energy inflation, creates a year-on-year headwind of approximately $150 million to $250 million or roughly $0.20 to $0.35 to EPS.  And finally, nonoperating items are estimated to be an impact to earnings per share of flat to minus $0.10. This range includes a year-on-year increase in nonoperating pension expense of $125 million, a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 18% to 19% and a lower year-on-year outstanding share count.  While there are a number of headwinds to earnings in 2023, ultimately, our full year performance will be driven by organic sales volumes, sustained progress in global supply chains and raw material availability, and our ability to drive improvements and reduce costs in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Finally, full year adjusted free cash flow conversion is forecasted to be in the range of 90% to 100%. This range includes the continued healing of global supply chains, expected improvements in working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions and full year capital expenditures of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $200 million of investment in water stewardship related to our exit of PFAS manufacturing.  Please turn to Slide 13. Looking at our expected performance by business. We see safety and industrial organic sales growth to be down low single digits in 2023. This includes an estimated decline in disposable respirator sales of $450 million to $550 million or a negative impact of approximately 4 percentage points as the business returns to pre-pandemic levels. Demand across industrial end markets is moderating as customers remain cautious. Our Safety and Industrial team will also be monitoring the recovery of industrial production activity in China as we start the year.  Adjusted organic sales growth for Transportation and Electronics, excluding the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing is forecasted to be down mid-single digits to flat organically. Looking across end markets, automotive unit volume production is currently forecasted to be up nearly 4% year-on-year.  We also expect automotive electrification trends to remain strong as we leverage our technologies and develop new innovative solutions for our automotive OEM customers. Electronics, however, is expected to be down significantly due to weak end market demand for TVs, tablets and smartphones, along with the ongoing impact of display technology shifting to OLED from LCD.  Health Care's organic sales growth is anticipated to be up low to mid-single digits versus 2022. We expect gradual improvement in health care elective procedure volumes as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact global health care systems.  In oral care, we will be monitoring consumer discretionary spending and its impact on patient visits, including orthodontic care. The Health Care team continues to create differentiated value and deliver strong margins for the attractive end markets we serve.  And finally, organic sales in Consumer are estimated to be down low single digits to flat as U.S. consumers remain cautious and retailers continue to aggressively reduce the excess inventory levels. Despite these near-term challenges, the consumer team remains focused on leveraging our iconic brands and accelerating new product launches in 2023.  Please turn to Slide 14. Before we go to Q&A, I want to walk through how we are seeing the first quarter. First, 3 weeks into January, we are seeing continued slowing in organic sales volume as we start the year. This slow start is driven by the same weakening end market trends that impacted the finish to 2022. We expect soft consumer discretionary spending, along with retailer destocking to continue into the first quarter. Sales of electronic devices are forecasted to be down between 10% and 30% sequentially in the first quarter, while semiconductor end markets and automotive builds are down mid-single digits sequentially. Health Care and oral care elective procedure volumes are expected to be at the same levels as Q4. And as we have noted, industrial end markets are mixed.  And we anticipate the ongoing COVID-related challenges to continue in China and the geopolitical situation in EMEA to persist. Therefore, taking all of these items into consideration, we estimate Q1 total adjusted sales in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion versus $8.5 billion adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing or down 10% to 15% year-on-year.  This anticipated year-on-year decline includes headwinds of 3 to 4 percentage points from disposable respirator sales declines and Russia exit, 3 to 4 percentage points from foreign currency translation, and 1 percentage point impact from divestitures. Taking these factors into account, we expect Q1 organic sales to be down low single digits to mid-single digits.  From an EPS perspective, we estimate that first quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.65. This range is impacted by the continued slowing of organic sales volumes, a pretax restructuring charge of $75 million to $100 million or $0.10 to $0.15 per share, a tax rate of approximately 19%, along with normal Q1 items.  As you can see, the first quarter presents a tough start to the year. We will have our most challenging year-on-year comps related to the declining disposable respirator demand and our exit of Russia. Ultimately, organic volume trends will be the biggest factor in determining how the quarter will turn out. 2023 is an important year as we work on progressing our strategies, including preparing for the spin of Health Care, improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and taking actions to further streamline the organization.  We are focused on creating the shortest path to the customer and providing innovative solutions to their most challenging problems. We will remain nimble and take appropriate actions as we respond to changing market dynamics. And we will continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability to ensure the long-term success of our enterprise.  To wrap up, I continue to be bullish on our long-term trends. The large and attractive end markets we serve provide exciting opportunities for the future of 3M. We are not satisfied with our performance and the expected start to this year. We are working to aggressively address our operating performance in this challenging environment. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronic markets stabilize, China works through its COVID-related challenges and as our year-on-year comps ease. We also expect supply chains to continue to heal and raw materials and logistic cost headwinds to abate.  Therefore, we anticipate improvements in organic growth, operating margins, earnings and cash flow as we progress through the year. As you've heard me say before, there is always more we can do and we will do to improve our performance. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers. That concludes my remarks.  We will now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. I was hoping you could walk us through, just perhaps logistically or opportunistically, how you exit PFAS. It's so kind of integrated with your product line, your manufacturing systems. Can you sell some facilities? Can you extract some value? Or is it -- or do you just have to kind of close -- lock up the facility and walk away? And how does that kind of work logistically? Yes, Scott. So maybe I'll take you back to the announcement of the exit. We said we'll exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We also said we would work to discontinue use of PFAS in our products broadly across the company. That's both in our products but also in the manufacturing of our products.  And I think your question is really on our manufacturing part of that. And we said we will meet contractual commitments that we have to our customers, and we're working closely with them to manage that as we make this transition. But ultimately, also, I talked about that we are not planning and won't sell the businesses and that we will plan to shut them down as we work through the transition as we get to the end of 2025. Scott, just also a reminder, as we disclosed, we said we would take -- the exit cost of this will be in the range of $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. And we took a fourth quarter charge of $800 million, that's included in that range of $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. Okay. That's helpful. And then you talked about doing some further restructuring, perhaps help us understand the scope or scale, or at least are you talking about -- I think you mentioned 2,500 people. But are there rooftops and meaningful kind of cost out that you see in this plan? Yes, Scott. So the announcement we made today was 2,500 jobs in manufacturing, really is responding to the volume that we see, the outlook for the volume. And that's -- we're putting a focus on supply chain. We see an opportunity to continue to streamline our supply chain. We hope to take advantage of some of the tailwinds as supply chains heal, as Monish talked about.  We're taking actions ourselves, and we're looking at what additional actions we can take there. And we're looking deeper in the company as well as we work to prepare for the Health Care spin, we've been looking at 3M ParentCo as well, and how do we simplify, streamline and put our position ourselves closer to customers. So it's really looking deeper and broader. And I think taking actions, proactively taking actions against the outlook we have for our markets. Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Mike or Monish, you mentioned that industrial end markets are moderating, customers are cautious. I think, for instance, you mentioned industrial adhesives and tapes were down in Q4. Has there been a material change from conversations that you've had previously with industrial customers? Or is this just gradual moderation?  And then is the regional weakness that you're seeing in China just a function of COVID interruption and more consumer base versus end demand related? And how do you think that pans out in '23? Yes. Andy, back to Monish's comments, we're seeing kind of mixed performance in the industrial markets. We see strengths as we said, as we came through the quarter in areas like electrical markets and automotive aftermarket. We were seeing some moderation in specific end market segments.  And the comment about industrial adhesives and tapes and closure and masking is some of that is related to the electronics slowdown. So that's part of that impact. It's also impacted by China. So China has really got a couple of things that are part of the slowdown. One of them is COVID and the interruption in the markets in industrial production and GDP. It's also reflecting the importance of electronics to that market into our business there in China. And we see that continuing those dynamics that we saw in Q4 continuing into the start of the new year.  We saw some moderation in specific segments of industrial. We saw specialty vehicle construction markets. We saw some moderation coming through the end of the quarter. We're off to a slow start as we start the year. There's a couple of areas of destocking really related to those end market segments where we've seen nothing more broad-based than that. We had strong performance across some of those other end markets in industrial. But we're starting to see some moderating and, like I said, January is off to a slower start for industrial. Mike, that's helpful. And then maybe could you give us a little more color regarding price versus cost expectations for '23. You mentioned the low single-digit price improvement you're seeing. You also mentioned supply chains are healing. Are you generally seeing pricing hold up for you despite some of this demand weakness across the portfolio? And then versus raw material and energy related headwinds, does that price versus cost equation getting increasingly green as you go throughout the year? Yes. So I think 2 different points in there, Andy. As you correctly pointed out, the carryover impact on what we have assumed right now in the guide is 2 pieces. On the selling price, we said approximately 2%. At the same time, the carryover impact of both raw materials and energy inflation is approximately [ 150 to 250 ]. So when you just do that equation together, right now, it's positive.  I think what we'll see as we go through is how do supply chains heal and how fast can we get the cost out. But at the same time, it will take a little bit of time as we sell through our higher cost goods through our inventory, you're going to see some of that moderate, but it will start showing up as the year progresses.  The key question for us that we have to think through and that's what we are thinking through is, as deflation starts showing up in the economy, the discussion that's going to come up is the elasticity of price across not just our company but across all companies.  And what we have found over time, Andy, as you know, 3M so well that, our innovation ultimately drives the value that we add for our customers. And historically, we have been able to have a good price cost equation because of the value that we add for our customers. So seeing what we'll see in '23 will depend on supply chains and what plays out in the long run, we are very confident that the price/cost equation continues to be green just because of the value we add to our customers. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Just a question. What are you guys just -- and if I missed it, I apologize, but are you sort of modeling an explicit recession in your forecast? What are your macroeconomic assumptions? I know you sort of said things are slow, but are you explicitly modeling a recession? Yes, Andrew, underlying our view of the year is -- the projection for the macro is part of it. And then we're talking about specific markets and dynamics that we're seeing coming through the quarter into -- coming through the fourth quarter into the new year.  So when you look at the macro global GDP, IPI in the 1.5% kind of range is the outlook for the year. You see U.S. softer than that. You see GDP below 1%. You see IPI even projected to turn negative as we get into the middle of the year. So those are kind of the macro dynamics that we're looking at.  We're also looking closely as we talked about in a couple of these market segments. Fourth quarter, we saw this 10% to 30% decline in the consumer electronics build and that is expected and projected. I would say, to continue as we get into first quarter and the first half of the year and consumer discretionary spending and the impact on the -- our end markets is -- that was in decline in Q4, I expect that to continue.  So the macro is part of it, and we're looking closely at these key market segments and the indicators there. And I think it really says Q1 looks like Q4 and there are some areas of additional slowing. And then we kind of look at the total macro for the rest of the year as we shape up our outlook. Got you. And then the question about pricing. Just historically, given -- and I know the way you report pricing is not necessarily how we think about pricing internally. I completely appreciate that.  But has anything changed in the market structure in terms of your ability to drive the pricing? I just would have thought for 3M, reported pricing would have been more of a tailwind into '23. But it is what it is, but are there any structural changes that you're seeing and that you're trying to address? Andy, there really is 2 parts to our pricing actions in the near term. One of them is what Monish talked about, we are always really looking closely at our price value in the marketplace. Our innovation delivers value to our customers.  We manage our pricing in the -- take advantage of that value and really make sure that we are getting that value through our broader market pricing. The last couple of years has brought in the inflation dynamic, and that's really been the driver. We are taking pricing actions to adjust for the input cost.  And so you've got a mix of our innovation as well as the inflation dynamic. And so as you look into 2023, you're -- we're confident we'll continue to position ourselves in strong price value based on our innovation. We are going to be managing inflation along with everyone else. How do we see that progressing, and what will we do with our prices, adjusting those if we see additional inflation and managing those as the -- I would say the elasticity in the market around inflation plays itself out. Our next question comes from Stephen Tusa with JPMorgan Securities. What are you guys seeing on the inventory side of the -- of your more industrial businesses? I think you talked a bit about auto, but maybe just on the general industrial side, customer inventory behavior? Yes. Steve, I touched on a little bit of that. I would say as we began Q4, overall inventory looked to be in pretty good shape. And that was with the notable exception of Consumer. Everyone was working to reduce the inventory, and we saw a lot of destocking efforts in Consumer.  As I said, we're starting to see some destocking in industrial. I would say, Asia and China, where we are seeing weaknesses in consumer electronics driving some of that. And as I mentioned earlier, some specialty markets like construction and a few other areas like even packaging, we're seeing some reduction of inventory as we start the new year.  When you look at our transportation and electronics business the consumer electronics OEMs are reducing inventories. With that outlook for their demand, they're reacting to it. Automotive OEM inventory still remains low. It's improving, but it remains low as they're recovering from some of the supply chain disruptions.  Health Care, overall, looks pretty stable. We see oral care channel reacting to some of the consumer discretionary spending and slowing there in oral care that we saw really in the second half, and then it comes back. The biggest move is in the consumer where retailers are still aggressively reducing inventory. So some dynamics reflecting some of the changes in demand in the end markets. Okay. And then you mentioned January was starting slow. I mean, can you give us a little bit of context? Is that -- is January or January -- is January organic kind of like below the low end for the -- of the annual range? Just roughly, just some color on kind of how slow January started for you guys? Yes, Steve. So back to January, yes, it is lower than the overall range. And partly, that's also driven by the toughest comps that we're going to have going into 1Q. As I mentioned, 7.2% to 7.6% -- $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion is the revenue range. It will be down 10% to 15% versus last year's adjusted. And you have to take revenue and adjusted for the exit of PFAS manufacturing, which would be around $8.5 billion. But embedded in that is 3% to 4% from foreign currency headwinds. So it's a Q4 carryover impact.  You've got 1% from divestitures, which is based on the closure of the Food Safety and some of the other transactions we did in 3Q. And then you've got a very large headwind from DR and Russia. If you recall last year, we had a very strong 1Q with the Omicron variant. Plus at that time, we had not announced the exit of Russia until mid-March. So that's another 300 to 400 basis points of pressure because you've got a comp. And therefore, overall, it's LSD to MSD is what we think right now is organic sales growth for 1Q. And what you'll find is as the year goes on, these comps start getting easier and that will start showing the growth on a year-over-year basis. Hopefully that answer your question. Yes. You weren't down double digit in January. Are you? Double digit? As of right now, we are somewhere in that range of where I told you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. I know we've talked a lot about the organic growth guidance for the year. I guess I'm just curious, when you think about the consumer specifically, it seems like you're embedding improvement as the year goes along. Is that just a function of inventories getting better? How much of that is China reopening? I just want to get an understanding of that business specifically. Yes. So on Consumer -- so you're right, Joe, I'll start with the summary, which is we are expecting that as things stabilize and as customers slow down their destocking, you will start seeing the comps get better in the year. The fourth quarter was extremely hard.  And as Mike said, we saw an acceleration of a trend in December. We continue to see that in January, and that's why the first quarter starts pretty soft. But our hope is that as things stabilize, as destocking gets better as consumer confidence builds into the year, we'll start seeing the consumer business starting to get better. Got it. That's helpful, Monish. And maybe my follow-up question is a little bit of a longer-term question on the electronics business. So specifically, I think in your comments, Monish, you mentioned that this shift into OLED, I know there was an announcement about Apple making their own custom displays starting in 2024. Just trying to understand like how that will potentially impact your business beyond this year? And then is it already expected to impact your business in 2023? What -- I would answer, and then I'll ask Mike to join in. The way I look at this, Joe, is there are a couple of things. The company has always -- has been looking at the LCD-OLED transition for a period of time. And that transition has been happening for a few years, and the team has continued to deal with that as it goes on.  What the team is working through is as new devices are coming on, what does that mean from a OLED to LCD ratio to mix. It definitely did have an impact for us in 2022. And then we are seeing what trends we are seeing -- as of right now, the trends we saw, we have predicted into 2023.  But with that said, the one thing about the electronics segment, and especially the display teams, is they always have a lot of innovation that is out there that helps offset some of these headwinds that come across. That business keeps reinventing itself as time has gone.  For example, Ashish and his team have launched products that are used in AR and VR technology, which also hopefully is a growth market in the future, and that's what -- that business is very good at looking at these trends, working these headwinds and then finding innovation to offset that as time goes. But right now, we have embedded what we think is the trend in LCD-OLED shift into our 2023 guide. Yes. And Joe, I would add we've been managing that transition and that trend for some time. It's -- and it's part of our innovation that we're doing with our customers, too, innovating on both sides of that, the OLED displays. And as Monish said, the other higher growth segments in electronics, historically, our electronics business has been overweight to consumer electronics.  And as we've talked about over the last few years, our strategy is continue to innovate there, and we're working with our customers multiple generations ahead, whether it's OLED displays or other applications, we're really working with them to innovate and drive value and opportunity for 3M in that consumer electronics.  At the same time, we recognize the big growth drivers are some of these other higher-growth segments. And Monish talked about AR/VR now emerging as one of those opportunities. Automotive electrification, of course, is the largest of those right now.  There's other areas like factory automation, and even into electronic into semiconductor manufacturing kinds of processes. So we are innovating in those spaces and at the same time, looking ahead and managing through the next display technologies and the next mobile device technologies and consumer electronics. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Maybe just wanted to start on the operating margins. So sort of backing into what you've talked about, are we right in assuming that the guide embeds sort of 19% operating margin for the year and sort of mid-teens in Q1?  And then on that Q1 aspect, very heavy decremental margins sequentially even without the restructuring charge. Is there a lot of sort of under production going on at 3M to clear out inventory, for example? Just trying to understand why that Q1 margin is so light. I think it's like a 50% decremental or something excluding the restructuring. Yes. So I've always said, Julian, first is volume gives us the best leverage. And what you have seen in Q4 continues into Q1. As we have said in Q4, we took some aggressive actions on making sure we rightsized our manufacturing facilities to help control inventory. Our plan is we will continue to aggressively manage production as a way to -- manage production as a way to manage cash at the same time so we're not building unnecessary inventory. So that's number one.  I think number 2 is, as I mentioned, there's continued pressure on a year-over-year basis on foreign currency between 3% to 4%. If you look at it versus fourth quarter exit rate, it's pretty much, I would say, flat to what fourth quarter exit rate was. And then the other item, you mentioned the restructuring, but we also have other normal 1Q items that we have from an accounting basis that we take which is normal in every quarter.  And that's why the start to 1Q is slower. But as you accelerate or move through the year, volume and the supply chain healing are the 2 factors that will continue to drive us to get these margins better. And if we're looking at it on a year-over-year basis, it's all driven by the comps that we had last year, which impact us heavily. So it's lower volume in Q1, that's a big driver and volume will be the big determinant on what we think Q1 is going to be. And Monish, is that roughly right on that sort of mid-teens operating margin Q1 and 19-ish for the year in your guide? Yes. Yes, it's -- we're actually close there. It's close enough, Julian. And then one quick follow-up on that for Mike. Mike, you've announced a restructuring program today. I think it's the first kind of formal discrete one since fourth quarter of 2020. And you had the business transformation savings program prior to that. Just wondered sort of when you think about the scope of the current restructuring plan, what kind of savings run rate we should expect annually when do you get to that? And how do you assess the kind of scope of this being enough to get margins back on track as you had those prior restructuring programs, but margins have sort of stayed under pressure? Yes, Julian, the way we're thinking about it. And like I said, this is certainly taking on what we see in the markets and in our performance and the supply chain dynamics that we're facing, all of that's part of what we're focused on as we look at these actions as we go through the year, adding to what we've already announced.  And then we are thinking and getting ready for the spin of Health Care. We're taking a deeper look, as I said, at everything we do. There's opportunities to streamline what we do as a company in the face of those end market dynamics and then in our operations. And we're learning from the changes that we've made to this point.  So we'll continue to work on that. In terms of giving you a view of the impact of that, that's something we'll come back with as we make decisions and announce those actions, those additional actions as we go through there. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Thank you for all the '23 planning assumption details and also for providing first quarter guidance, I know that's not a typical practice but given all the moving parts, we appreciate that. So my question relates -- it's come up a couple of times on the Health Care spin.  Can you remind us the timing that you're expecting? There was some noise about the potential challenges in the courts. Where does that stand? And on the separation costs, how much is this impacting '23? Or is that all excluded and stranded costs? How quickly would you be able to address those? Yes, Deane, maybe I'll talk a little bit about just the spin now. Monish can talk about the separation cost model. We have a dedicated team working and building the execution plans. We're making very good progress. We talked about our expectation that we would be completing the spin by the end of '23, early '24 and that's kind of the focus for the teams as they work to execute this.  You commented on there had been some -- actually, there was a suit in the marketplace around the spin of Health Care and again, would we be able to complete that spin. And that was something that was dismissed. And so there's nothing from that dynamic that's impacting us. It's really about our teams working to execute the spin. And as I said, they're making very good progress. We're confident that we're moving in the right direction and moving ahead at pace. So as regards to the guide, Deane, as we had disclosed when we announced the spin of Health Care, we currently do not -- we are thinking of counting it as a special item, so that will be excluded from our ongoing operations. We are unable to predict how much of that will show up in 2023, so we haven't put that in our guide.  But when we had announced the transaction, we had given you a framework that our transaction cost of spin-off will be somewhere in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, which is a mixture of CapEx and OpEx. The teams are continuing to work that as they go through right now. We've now been at this for the last 4 to 5 months.  So as we get better estimates around that, we will definitely keep you posted. And then as regards stranded cost, as Mike mentioned, and we had also mentioned it in the last quarter, this is an opportunity for us to look at everything that we do as we are getting ready for the spin.  And our goal is to reduce stranded costs as much as we can, and we'll keep working it as we go through it. And we'll definitely let you all know as we figure this out. But the teams are actively working. The teams are staffed and they're doing an amazing job keeping the program on track. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. We've covered a lot of ground here. But I want to go back to 1Q '23, perhaps Monish. We calculate a 15% margin, which is kind of similar to Julian's mid-teens. I don't think we've ever seen a margin that low. I think the GFC, we saw 17% and change margin. So just wondering why margins will be so low. And I understand supply chain is a factor here, but why 15%? What's going on?  And as part of this sort of question, the kind of the coverage of the full year plan even at the low end of the range is still really, really low. So I think it's about 17% to 19% coverage, making a very, very back-end loaded year. So I know you said volume gets better, but what gives you confidence and what can give investors confidence is enough capture in the back half of the year? Yes. So I think 2 different questions and both great ones. So I'll try to answer the first one, similar to what I told Julian. Volume gives us the best leverage. And when you just look at it even sequentially and you adjust for FX, which helped us versus a guide that we had given, volumes are going to be flat.  We have started very low in the month of January, and that puts tremendous pressure on our fixed cost, number one. Number two, we have a restructuring charge. And then number three, our tax rate is 19%. And then, of course, we have some another normal 1Q items from an accounting basis that we take.  So when you put all that together, I would say, Nigel, it comes down to volume. Volume is down 10% to 15% on a year-over-year basis. And so that's number one. This is the toughest comp and you have DR and the exit of Russia, both of which we have disclosed in the past. When you apply them at company margin, which is at 46%, that puts pressure also on a year-over-year basis.  When I go through the remaining quarter year and as you correctly asked the question, what happens on margins, as you start thinking about -- we exit some of these comps that are difficult, 1Q being the toughest, volumes will start -- our comps will start getting better.  The supply chain efficiencies, the actions that we have announced also in 1Q and some of the actions we took in 4Q will all start showing up in the remaining of the year. Again, as I mentioned, some of these items, including cost out from raw materials take a little bit of time as we work through our higher cost of inventory through the system.  If you also look at external data, and that's what we can look at because none of us are able to predict what we can in the future, external data says the second half gets better. It gets better in China, it gets better globally. And that's another reason why we are hopeful that as volumes come back in the second half, we should see our own margins go up and our own revenue go up.  But with that said, at the end of the day, we control -- we don't control the markets, but what we definitely control is our own actions. And so continuing to drive supply chain efficiency, continuing to make sure that we are being as nimble and agile as we can.  Using Mike's words, we are looking at everything. We're being very careful and discretionary in hiring. And 2023 is an important year [ for you ]. It's a year that we plan to execute on a lot of our strategies over the last few years, including the spin of our Health Care and improving our supply chain operations.  I just want to end with your question, Nigel. we are not satisfied with where we are. We're going to continue to look at this. We're going to continue to be nimble and agile as the volume plays itself out. And our goal is to keep building from where we are right now. Nigel, I just want to correct one thing Monish said. Our total sales for Q1 are going to be down 10% to 15%, not volume. I'm sorry. Yes. Organic sales growth is forecast to be down low single digits to mid-single digits. Okay. I was going to follow up on that. So thanks for that clarification, Bruce. And I know I've asked 2 questions there, but I do have one for Mike. You said everything's on the table in terms of your reorganization and things about new ways of doing things, 5 or 6 years ago, 3M went through a sort of pretty big centralization of supply chain and business support functions. In hindsight, has that left the organization a bit too rigid? Was that the right move? And could you unwind that civilization? Yes, I would say that, Nigel, that the change is that -- there's a couple of different changes that we made to the supply chain maybe that you're thinking about. One was, we did take actions on some of the structure and really looking at factories, our footprint of factories a number of years ago. And then we moved to -- when we announced the change to our business group led model, we went to a common supply chain model globally. And we made some additional steps in that in last year, really to continue to drive more flexibility, greater streamlined performance end to end in our supply chain. So we see it really more as an opportunity to build on the changes we have made and drive simplification, streamline, more productivity, reducing our costs, delivering more directly to customers.  So it's continuing to build on some of those changes. I think those actually have positioned us to be more flexible as we go ahead. And there's an expectation that supply chains will continue to heal. So we want to be able to take advantage of those tailwinds that we hope to see as we go through the year.  At the same time, we control what we control, and that is making additional changes based on what we've learned to really execute our performance in our supply chain. It's the biggest opportunity we have to improve margin and cash flow as we go through the year. And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. I don't know if I missed this or not, but you mentioned that free cash flow conversion is 90% to 100% this year. Is that a long-term goal. Can you maintain that? I mean, as things kind of, I guess, will get less volatile in the out years? Yes, it's 90% to 100% for 2023, just to be clear, that was the guide. For last year, we ended at 82%. As I've said multiple times, the opportunity for 3M's cash from a working capital comes from inventory management and EP. And to answer your question, is it sustainable? Of course, it will ultimately depend on the income that we generated depends on how supply chains behave and the capital.  But if you just look at the ability for us to use data and data analytics to help drive inventory and working capital clearly exists. In the fourth quarter, the teams did an amazing job to take inventories down, got it down by nearly $250 million. And as supply chains start to heal, this is clearly an opportunity for us, and we're going to keep driving that. We have no further phone questions at this time. To wrap up, we are focused on creating value for customers and shareholders in a challenging environment. We will continue to take actions to improve our performance, control costs and drive simplification while building 3M for the future. Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines."

Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Hope you've all had a good start to the new year, and I thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2023.  I'd like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and from the year, and then Jay will review the financials in a more detailed manner. Lockheed Martin had a strong close to 2022. All of our business areas met or exceeded our prior expectations, resulting in a 2022 full year sales of $66 billion, segment operating profit of $7.2 billion and earnings per share of $21.66.  Our free cash flow for the year of $6.1 billion also came in above our prior expectation, while backlog for the year increased to $150 billion, driven by all-time record orders for Lockheed Martin. Our financial results included more than $1.7 billion of independent research and development investments, or IRAD, a new high watermark for the company. We also continue to modernize and streamline our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.  Significant capital projects include our ongoing investment in what we call One Lockheed Martin transformation or 1LMX. This is our multiyear internal project to transform our business processes and systems from end to end. By implementing new digital tools in our operations and expanding our use of model-based engineering to enhance our speed to market and our cost competitiveness.  In 2022, we completed a majority of the detail design for our new systems and business processes. And for 2023, we expect to complete the detailed design and implementation road maps that go with it, and then we'll transition to the system build and configuration phase over the next couple of years.  These IRAD and capital investments accelerate the capabilities our customers need and for our operations to efficiently and effectively meet those needs. From a capital return perspective, we delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 via share repurchases of $7.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion.  During the fourth quarter specifically, we entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we've retired approximately 7 million shares under that agreement so far. We expect to complete our remaining repurchase authorization of $10 billion over the next few years, consistent with our focus to deliver free cash flow per share growth to you, the investor. These operational and financial results created significant value for our shareholders, ending the year with a total shareholder return of 40%.  I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense, or DoD, budget. In late December, Congress signed the FY '23 OMNIBUS spending bill into law, appropriating $858 billion for national defense, including $817 billion for the DoD-based budget. This reflects approximately 10% growth year-over-year for both national defense and the DoD-based budget.  The law also represents a 6% or $45 billion increase from the President's budget request for DoD.  These appropriations enabled us, along with the Joint Program Office, to finalize the contract for the production and delivery of up to 398 F-35s for $30 billion in Lots 15 and 16, including the option for Lot 17. Further, several other of Lockheed Martin programs received the funding levels necessary to drive the growth outlook we previously identified, including our Combat Rescue Helicopter, the C-130J, Black Hawk, CH-53K and FAAD. We view this funding outcome as positive for the future, and our current expectation is that growth will materialize over the longer term, starting in 2024.  Let's now turn to the 4 growth pillars: programs of record, hypersonics, classified activities and new awards. With regard to programs of record, there were several important developments in key signature programs in our fourth quarter. On the F-35, the definitization of Lots 15 through 17, as I mentioned a minute ago, included the first F-35 aircraft to be produced for Belgium, Finland and Poland. We received authorization to procure long lead items for Lot 18 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. allies as well.  We also formally welcome Germany, the ninth foreign military sales country, to the F-35 Lightning II program. And earlier in January, Canada officially became an F-35 operator as the country selected the aircraft to replace its aging fighter fleet.  We continue to expect deliveries of the F-35 to ramp to 156 by 2025. Despite the temporary pause in flight operations and corresponding suspension of engine deliveries that began in December and resulted in the delivery of just 141 F-35s in 2022, 7 shy of our expectation of 148 before the engine issue was discovered.  Also in the quarter, the U.S. Navy authorized the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter to enter full rate production and then its deployment phase. This important milestone allows the program to proceed beyond low-rate initial production. And this achievement attests to our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps and instills confidence and stability in Sikorsky's diverse domestic supply chain.  In addition, at Sikorsky, international demand for the Black Hawk remains strong. Last week, the Australian Army announced it will acquire 40 UH-60M BLACK HAWK helicopters to replace its current multi-role helicopter fleet. Deliveries are expected to begin for Australia this year.  Further, the Lockheed Martin built Orion exploration class spacecraft launched on NASA's Artemis 1 and completed a 25-day flight test, slashing down off the coast of California. This successful mission takes us one step closer to the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon.  On its journey, Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles through deep space and surpassed records for total distance. It traveled 270,000 miles from home and the farthest distance from earth by a spacecraft designed to carry humans. We look forward to the next stages of the program with 7 additional missions under contract.  Turning to hypersonics. In December, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted a hypersonic-boosted flight test of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon. This was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile, meeting all its objectives for the test, including reaching speeds of greater than 5x the speed of sound.  With regard to classified programs, we achieved successful milestones across multiple business areas in 2022 and grew 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in classified that will outpace the rest of the portfolio over the next several years.  And finally, at new awards, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor, or NGI, continues to make progress. In late October, we announced the delivery of the first NGI flight software package to the Missile Defense Agency, providing the framework of software development tools, process workflows, scripts and environments. The delivery was ahead of schedule and is a critical step on the path for flight testing and fielding. This program remains a focused competition for Lockheed Martin with the first NGI forecast for delivery in 2027.  With regard to the future long-range assault aircraft, or FLRAA, competition, we were disappointed in the U.S. Army's decision. And upon review, we determined a formal protest by Sikorsky on behalf of team Defiant to be the best course of action. We continue to believe that DEFIANT X with its increased speed, range, maneuverability and survivability is the transformational and most cost-effective aircraft that best meets the selection criteria for this competition.  Sikorsky remains 1 of 2 competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative that's called the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, which is currently expected to be awarded in 2025. The first RAIDER X competitive prototype is over 90% complete and has more than 65% of its acceptance test procedures already done. Sikorsky is the only company with a representative FARA technology demonstrator aircraft. I saw it fly down at West Palm Beach a few months ago. It's amazing, the S-97 Raider, which has completed more than 110 flight hours.  In November, Norway became the first international customer for our new TPY-4 Radar. It's the first software-defined Radar that outperforms in target detection, mission diversity and transportability. Norway is going to receive 8 of Lockheed Martin's TPY-4 Radars with options for 3 additional Radars.  Finally, backlog ended 2022 at $150 billion with book-to-bill of 1.2x and increases in every business area across Lockheed Martin. This strong demand signal bodes well for future growth over the longer term for our company. So these 4 pillars will guide us as we face a challenging geopolitical environment and apply growth and integrated capabilities mindset to everything we do here.  As conflict continues in Ukraine, unfortunately, and projected global threats require coordinated efforts to protect the U.S. and our allied territories, ongoing progress in our 21st Century Security vision will enable the acceleration of advanced capabilities to deter these threats and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations for our military service customers.  In the fourth quarter, we continued to announce and expand strategic agreements with America's leading commercial digital companies, such as IBM's Red Hat, to advance artificial intelligence innovation on Lockheed Martin military platforms. And for Microsoft, with whom we're going to help power classified cloud advanced technologies for the Department of Defense. Microsoft's latest secure framework will make Lockheed Martin the first nongovernment entity to independently operate inside the Microsoft Azure Government Secret Cloud, ushering in a new era of cloud opportunities for the industry.  As we look ahead, demand for Lockheed Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United States and abroad. We continue to expect 2023 sales about the same level as we discussed back in October. We also continue to expect a return to sustained top line growth in 2024 and beyond as headwinds diminish in our program mix, the supply chain continues to recover and our signature programs grow.  Free cash flow per share will remain a key focus as we maximize returns for you, our shareholders. 2022 is a year of great accomplishments for our company in the face of a lot of dynamic challenges. The outstanding achievements of our teams resulted from real deep commitments across our business areas and better cooperation among them as well as our corporate functions to develop, produce and deliver world-class systems to our country and its allies. Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 116,000 team members and the values we all share.  So with that, let me hand it off to Jay to give more color on the financials, and we'll join you later to answer your questions. Jay? Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results for 2022, additional business area detail and offer a first full look at 2023 guidance. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today.  Let's begin with Chart 3, an overview of our consolidated 2022 financials. Lockheed Martin followed up a solid third quarter with a strong finish to 2022, highlighted by 7% year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter and effectively managed a turbulent year impacted by COVID and supply chain disruptions as well as inflation levels not seen in decades.  Besides sales, we also exceeded our expectations for segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow, all while absorbing incremental headwinds tied to restructuring activities within RMS and mark-to-market losses in our investment portfolios. We also booked record orders in 2022, resulting in 11% growth to an ending backlog of $150 billion.  In addition to our orders on F-35, we experienced a surge in new interest for our industry-leading security solutions, such as in classified programs in Space and in Missiles and Fire Control, where we booked approximately $1.5 billion in orders, reflecting increased demand to replenish U.S. stocks and enhance security positions globally. And we delivered on our commitment to boost shareholder returns by deploying nearly $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making significant investments in our businesses.  Taken together, these results demonstrate the perseverance of our dedicated employees to perform in challenging environments and support our expectations for 2023 and beyond.  Taking a closer look at full year results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart 4. Sales came in higher than expected by nearly $750 million, limiting the decline to 2% year-over-year and essentially recovering to the sales guidance we had originally communicated last January. The stronger-than-expected performance was broad-based across all 4 business areas and reflects strong coordination with supplier partners to drive material throughput and program schedule performance as well as some favorable award timing, which drove additional revenue.  Segment operating profit declined 2% year-over-year but also finished higher than expected by almost $50 million driven by the higher sales. Operating margins settled at 10.9%, slightly lower year-over-year and versus expectations based on lower net favorable profit adjustments.  Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. Adjusted earnings per share grew 2% for the year as the benefit from share repurchases overcame headwinds from lower segment profit and FAS/CAS pension income.  Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. We delivered $6.1 billion of free cash flow for the year while investing almost $1.7 billion in CapEx at a ratio of 1.4x depreciation. We also ended the year with nearly $1.5 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers, maintaining our commitment to a resilient supply chain.  As I noted earlier, 2022 represented a significant year of cash deployment. In total, we returned 178% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022, leveraging our performance and strong balance sheet while still investing for our anticipated growth trajectory in 2024 and beyond.  Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Full year sales grew 1% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in our classified programs, partially offset by lower F-35 production volume. Operating profit increased 2% driven by higher net favorable profit adjustments more than offsetting the impact of the lower volume. For the year, backlog at Aeronautics grew 15%.  As mentioned, Aeronautics completed the F-35 Lot 15 through 17 negotiation and secured production volumes while providing the services with a value proposition that combines the highest performance at affordable cost.  Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales decreased 3% driven primarily by lower volume on our special ops sustainment program following the Afghan withdrawal, along with lower volume on sensors programs. Segment operating profit was down 1% with lower favorable profit adjustments primarily on PAC-3. For the year, backlog increased 6% on the back of tactical missile strength.  At Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9, sales decreased year-over-year by 4% driven primarily by a nonrecurring revenue event in our training business in 2021 along with lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 7%, following Sikorsky and C6ISR volume and lower favorable profit adjustments on the Black Hawk program.  Backlog grew 4% in 2022, led by the Defense of Guam award, where RMS will be the lead integrator of the multi-domain air and missile defense system as well as stronger Sikorsky orders.  Turning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales decreased 2% due to the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program, partially offset by growth on a Next Generation Interceptor program and national security space. Operating profit decreased 8% with lower net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Backlog grew 16% based on strong classified program captures and Orion orders. So all told, a strong finish to the year.  So let's now shift to 2023 on Page 11. Before introducing our expectations, I'd like to inform you of a reporting change in segment operating profit starting in 2023. We will report purchased intangible asset amortization expense in unallocated corporate expense below segment operating profit. Previously, intangible amortization was included in segment operating profit. This change will not impact total earnings, and we believe the change provides a more accurate view of operating performance for each of our 4 business areas. The impact is approximately 40 basis points on our 2023 expectations, consistent with the impact in previous years.  Our 2023 financial outlook includes the impact of this change, and you can find supporting data for these adjustments in the appendices of our web charts as well as in the earnings release.  Okay. Let's get into the outlook for 2023. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion and the midpoint is slightly below 2022. Speaking to the timing of sales this year, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year, ramping up quarter-over-quarter as we did in 2022.  Segment operating profit for 2023 normalized for intangible asset amortization has improved what we thought -- from what we thought in October. And we now estimate only 10 basis points of headwind from 2022 with segment operating margins at 11.1% under our new reporting.  We currently expect $2.1 billion of FAS/CAS income in 2023. It's estimated to be roughly $100 million lower in '22, excluding the impact from our pension transfer transaction.  Our earnings per share is expected to be between $26.60 and $26.90 for '23 with the year-over-year reduction to adjusted EPS primarily driven by lower segment operating profit in FAS/CAS income, partially offset by the benefit from a lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2023 is greater to or equal than $6.2 billion and assumes continued enactment of the R&D tax capitalization. This increase of $100 million to cash generation, along with our share repurchase guide of another $4 billion, highlights our continued focus on increasing free cash flow per share for our shareholders. This projected combination of higher free cash flow and a lower share count lead to a mid-single-digit growth expectation in free cash flow per share in 2023.  Okay. On Chart 20 -- on Chart 12, let's sum it all up. We closed out 2022 with a strong finish with operating momentum and a robust backlog, which have us well positioned to resume growth in 2024 and beyond. We also placed a premium on leveraging our strong cash generation and balance sheet to increase cash returns to our shareholders with a significant increase to share repurchases.  Across all 4 business areas, our breadth of development, production and sustainment programs continue to drive a foundation of growth and sustained high performance. And we will work actively with our customers to meet their increasing demands and mission requirements looking ahead to the future. Our investments for growth, value and efficiency are aligned with our strategy for technology advancement and improved synergies across Lockheed Martin.  So in closing, we believe the business is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And first go the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Jim, I wanted to ask you about -- you highlighted the headwinds that you have in terms of your program mix in '23 is the reason for flattish sales. Could you quantify what that number is in terms of the headwind and what programs specifically you're looking at?  And then as a quick follow-up, the FY '23 budget came in, I think, a fair amount better than you were anticipating plus ups on F-35 and C-130. How might that change what you've previously said with regard to the reacceleration in growth in 2024? Is it better than low single digit now? So David, let me take the first one and then kick over the second part of your question to Jim and just really talk in the context of '23 and what's going to be different in 2024. In 2023, when you look at it, we've got continued growth in our 4 pillars, really the programs of record that Jim had mentioned. But we do have some specific unique items to 2023, and I'll give you an example.  For example, in aero. On the F-35, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in sustainment on the program. But we are expecting also a mid-single-digit decline in production as deliveries catch up to the material that we had purchased in prior years.  Similarly, on the F-16, we're going to see continued growth in production to roll out our backlog, but we are seeing a reduction in modernization and sustainment programs on the F-16. So as those -- both of those normalize in 2023 going into 2024, they will no longer be headwinds, which will take a while for growth in Aeronautics, particularly in the F-35 sustainment and on F-16 production.  Similarly, like MFC, what we saw in 2022 and it carries over a little bit to 2023 is some of the areas where we see the higher demand from a production level, particularly in programs of record, things like PAC-3, it's taken us a little bit longer than we originally expected to ramp up. And so we're going to see gradual improvement in supply chain as well as our internal operations in '23 with stronger growth in 2024.  At RMS, CH-53 will double deliveries in '24 versus '23. And '23 versus '22 is pretty much flat deliveries. We also see probably some Black Hawk growth in '24 as well. And what we're going through right now is the transition for multiyear 9 to multiyear 10 in RMS and Sikorsky specifically. So those are all things that we think will lift from '24 relative to '23, and those are headwinds that are really unique to 2023. Yes. And as far as where the defense budget came out, David, it really aligns with our view in our company about the nature of the geopolitical threat, the need to modernize U.S. and allied forces to continue to hopefully deter armed conflict beyond the sad and unfortunate situation in the Ukraine that's already happened, and the fact that there's bipartisan support in Congress to do just that. So we've been expecting all along in our kind of long-range plan that the U.S. government and Congress would step up to meet the reality of the global geopolitical situation. And that's exactly what played out in the budget process for FY '23.  We also expect that same reality to continue to sadly exist again in the next budget cycle, which is happening even now in 2020 -- for 2024. So we don't see the circumstances, the fundamentals changing. Therefore, we also believe that the continued robustness of the defense budget is going to be a reality as well. Just let me follow up on your last question, David, whether or not there's upside. Where we see potential increases to where we were at baseline before really is in MFC. Over the next 5 years, we've got revenue potential. It's around $6 billion. And that would more than offset lost revenue associated with FLRAA should that decision hold. And so net-net, we see that there could be some upside over the next 5 years. And next, we'll go to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Jim, maybe one quick one and one sort of allow you to expand a little bit. When is your expected restart of deliveries in the F-35, is the quick one? And then, obviously, there's more of a debate going on in D.C. around fiscal restraint that has been in place in the last several years. And so I'm just curious where you think this ends up as one thing, but more importantly, what, if anything, do you do operationally to prepare yourself for whatever the outcomes are in terms of balance sheet holding back on repo or leaning forward, looking for areas where 2023 budget -- excuse me, 2024 budget might be in a continuing resolution for a full year. Anything on that perspective from an operational perspective? Sure, Myles. So as far as timing and resumption of deliveries on F-35, I think it's really important to differentiate between delivery and production, right? So we are continuing production in the final assembly factories at Fort Worth and Italy and in Japan at the same pace we expected to before the mishap occurred. We're also continuing to order and receive parts and materials from our supply chain as well. And so once an aircraft rolls out of the factory, our pilots and the DoD pilots conduct a handful of acceptance flights. That's what's kind of on hold right now. It's just that portion of the process. So the vast majority of our revenue, much greater than 90% is earned when the aircraft rolls out from the plant door. So Jay can add more color on the financial perspective, if you like, a little bit later, but that's really what happens. And so as far as the timing of resumption of deliveries, we'll be notified of that when the U.S. government and the propulsion supplier conclude their ongoing mishap investigation. Jay, do you want to add anything to that? No. You got it. That's it. Okay. And then secondly, we really can't predict the political dynamic in Congress and -- within and with the administration. So we're going to keep our head down, stay on our plan, do our job and expect that the right thing will occur at the other end of the 2024 budget process, which is fully funding and making available that funding to the Department of Defense, so we can deter conflict with them and that they can acquire what they need to do that. So that's our expectation. It's really difficult for us to lay out what we think the budget process will be given the nature of the House, Senate and the administration right now. But we expect that they are going to come together and do what's needed to defend the country and get the budget done. And next, we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Jay, we've talked about this dynamic where the outlays are trailing the authorization and the possibility that supply chain is intertwined in that. And that was kind of tough in the first half of the year, look to be getting better in the third quarter, but then exited the year declining. Do you have any insight into -- incremental insight into what's going on there when that gets better? And to the extent that supply chain is related, your comments that you expect that to improve through '23, is that underway? You already see that happening? Or is that still just a logical anticipation of timing? Sure. Good question. Let me follow up. And we looked at this and tried to triangulate performance in a number of different ways. We looked at just straight piece part on-time delivery here in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw in the second and the third. We also looked at program performance, so earned value-type metrics, and we really didn't see a meaningful change in on-time delivery or schedule performance relative to our earned value systems. But what I will say is the fourth quarter had a significant step-up in requirements. And if you adjust for the number of weeks in the fourth quarter relative to the balance of the year and you also adjust for some of these benefits that we saw in terms of award timing, our requirements in the fourth quarter stepped up sequentially by about 5%. And I would say the entire value chain, whether it's our internal operations and the supply chain, was able to meet that increased level of requirements. So that, to me, bodes well to the future as well as expecting a gradual improvement in 2023. And I think that just provides a reasonable assumption and a reasonable basis for that assumption. And we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. If you look at the F-35 program, like the incremental profit you reported was about a 16.4% rate, so I assume you stepped up the margin on the F-35. And going forward then, the slight decline that you're forecasting in the margin probably reflects sustainment growing versus production. And a quick follow-up, the $20 million charge that you took in a classified program in aero, was that the same program that you took large charges a couple of years ago? Okay. So George, I can probably answer your questions with one yes, but maybe I'll provide a little bit of color here. I now take the -- you're correct, on the charge we took, that was related to the program. We continue to have some learnings there. But our team, I think, in Skunk Works is doing a great job managing that program. And this is a development program where you see and you continue to have learnings. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we've managed that quite well. And it really hasn't -- did not impact our results. And as far as the F-35 program, we did see some benefits there. And you're right, in the quarter, we were -- the results there were augmented not only by the volume but as well as the net profit adjustments at Aeronautics, and it was across the board. I think next year, as we think about the margin, yes, there's a little bit of a headwind there. I think mix does play a part in it as well as right now, we're planning a little bit lower favorable profit adjustments. But for the year, in the grand scheme of Lockheed Martin, this year, we did about 25% of profit in net profit adjustments, and we would expect that to be somewhat similar for the entire company for '23. Thanks for the question, George. And next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Jim, I think everyone would agree that Lockheed's got the pole position in offensive hypersonics. Strong program portfolio there and some recent successes. What I think people might be interested in are your efforts as well in counter hypersonics as we might expect that to be a growing portion of the budget. Can you talk about that a little bit? Sure. And it's largely classified, Rob. But what I can say is many of the elements of counter hypersonics, we also have a pole position in, right? So we've got existing products that we can take the lessons learned from and a lot of the engineering and apply them to just a faster incoming target, right? So we're working on NGI, as you already heard, which is a ballistic missile. It travels at similar speeds. We have the FAAD system, which is a sort of a high-altitude interceptor as well. And then we have PAC-3, which is a very accurate lower-level further in, if you will, defensive systems. So we've got the engineering talent. We've got the intellectual property. And we're developing these 21st Century Security concepts like applying artificial intelligence to network systems together and process data much more quickly, which, of course, you need that to process the information coming in on a Mach 5 missile, right? So I think we have a lot of the elements that will go into the eventual counter hypersonic solutions, and we are working on many of them right now in integrating what we have and developing what we need. Our next question is from Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. So I wanted to ask you about the F-16 and maybe expand on the remarks you made just a few moments ago. I thought you might comment on things like U.S. and international opportunity set ahead, maybe update on the first delivery expected production rates. And if it's at all possible, maybe touch on like what margins you're expecting on the program right now. I'm just thinking that they should be pretty decent given the move to Greenville was done to improve the cost structure on the program. Rich, it's Jim. I'll start off quickly and hand it over to Jay for some of the background and data associated with the program. But the really great news is Block 70, which is the production article out of Greenville. The first Greenville Block 70 test flight was this morning was successful, really great milestone for the company and for that organization in South Carolina. But there's significant demand for this aircraft. A lot of it's coming organically, I guess, I'll call it, from allies around the world. Also, we're out actively marketing this jet to those countries that may not be authorized yet or maybe not have the infrastructure for F-35 at this moment but may in the future. India is one of those. I co-chair the U.S.-India CEO Forum with Secretary Raimondo. We're going to be going over there in a month or so with a team of CEOs from across our industry and meet with theirs and try to get collaboration going. And one of the, I would say, primary opportunities in that endeavor is the F-21, which is F-16 variant specifically designed for India, for example. So we haven't made that sale yet, but I can tell you all the way up to my level, we are out marketing F-16, and we have a lot of organic demand coming in from either existing, order customers or new ones.  Jay, anything you want to add? Sure. Just maybe a little bit more color. Just on top of the first flight that we had today the successful first flight, congratulations to our Aeronautics team there. We have over 20 aircraft that are currently in process in the production phase. We will deliver anywhere between, say, 78 aircraft this year, and then that will step up significantly in 2024. And so we're on a good path that we recognize the opportunities that are in front of us. There are a few countries that have been announced there that we're eagerly awaiting contract finalization, hopefully this year, with Jordan and Bulgaria. That's about -- combined about 20 aircraft. And so the demand, as Jim mentioned, is pretty significant. And we're ramping up as we speak to be able to deliver the customer requirements. Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Jay, I'm sorry to waste a question on pension. But if we look at the CAS recoveries, it was about 30% of this year's cash flow. And I know there's discount rates and returns and all that stuff, but CAS tends to be much more visible than FAS on the income statement. So can you give us a multiyear outlook for the CAS recoveries over the next few years and where the balance stood at year-end? Yes. I mean -- so for cash this year, as we mentioned, that will decline this year. I said about $100 million. Specifically, the CAS element will decline by about -- the recoveries by about $75 million. We'll see that decline a little bit more over the next few years as well. And so it will come down in the range, I think, around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion over the next few years. And so that's the best outlook we have today. As you know, these things are -- they do fluctuate and a little volatile. So we'll update that accordingly as we go and think about next year and what that means for 2025, Seth. And next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Jay, I wanted to just focus on Missiles and Fire Control. Just kind of obviously a little transition in growth this year, but profitability kind of going to be down also looks like close to 90 basis points. Just maybe walk us through a little bit kind of some of the puts and takes there and just thoughts about kind of margin recovery as we think about the next couple of years where we've got all this growth inflected. Yes. No, good question. This is something we talked a little bit on the third quarter call. We've got some new program awards, particularly in classified, that are going to put some margin pressure not just next year but a few years beyond that as well. And it's really just on the early phase of these programs as we head into production. It's just low margin, and it will take time to have those restore to margins that we've seen in the past. What I will say is that we do have the benefit of some offsetting mix with the upside that we're seeing in this business. I mentioned before a potential $6 billion over the next 5 years. Those will come with more solid margins will help mitigate the reduction that we're seeing on these new programs. But there will be some pressure there that we have to deal with. And look, the MFC team has a good track record of driving out cost, driving margins. I'm confident they'll be able to do that in the future as well, but it will take a few years to get there. Next, we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Maybe switching gears to a different topic. With tighter cost of capital, we've seen valuations come down in high-growth investments. Is this a better time for corporate VC to enter into deals on attractive terms? I mean just looking at the limitations on M&As from the FTC stance that we saw with Aerojet Rocketdyne, I mean how should we think about the importance of Lockheed Martin Ventures to access these new technologies? And could we see ventures double from here? Kristine, this is Jim. One of the first things I did when I came from the Board to active management was to double -- as you said, to double the venture fund, right? So it was $200 million, now it's $400 million. We're actively -- actually, very actively looking to invest that additional funding. In the great scheme of the company, though, it's really designed to discover emerging technology that might be applicable to our strategy and to our products and systems and help kind of develop that technology in a way that it can have utilization earlier than perhaps otherwise for our industry. So we get the most benefit out of our venture fund in actual operations, production and development of platforms and systems. We have had a nice upturn in the valuations of those investments as well, but they're not necessarily driving the ultimate results or the ultimate growth prospect of the company, but they're indirectly doing just that. I'll just add, Kristine, I mean it's a great point. I mean we've got a pretty tight alignment on the targets that we pursue to our technology road maps. And these are examples like Joint All Domain Operations interoperability, autonomy, artificial intelligence and other areas that will help us drive and accelerate our internal organic capability with these new emerging technologies. And so it's a great point. There's certainly opportunity there. As Jim mentioned, we've increased our availability of funding for that, and we're excited about those opportunities. And next, we'll go to Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Jay, you guys have taken a bit of a different approach on this R&D tax issue than some of your peers. And I know this subject has been beaten to death already, but I'm just curious if you've had any recent conversations with the government on whether they're going to agree with the approach you've taken. And then I guess just stepping back more broadly, you had this uncertain tax position disclosed in the 10-Q. Just kind of give us a sense for when you think that might get resolved. Sure. Good question. We remain confident in the position that we've taken. We've had really no dialogue. We are awaiting guidance from the IRS on what contracts specifically would be covered. You're right that different players have taken different positions. We remain confident in our position. We believe that the risk is a factor. And when you are under particularly cost-type contracts, there is no risk taken by the provider of those services. Secondly, we believe the benefit is marginal because the owner or the contractor of that work is really the one that takes over that technology and can transfer it to others at any point in time. And so we think that those are sound base and sound arguments supported by legal teams that we have in the position that we've taken. But again, it's uncertain -- and our uncertain tax position really reflects that uncertainty. So I can't give you specific one way or the other in terms of IRS positions because we just don't know as of yet. But I can tell you, we spent a lot of time researching this, a lot of time discussing it, deliberating it internally, and we think the position that we've come out is the right position. And next, we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Jay, a boring inflation question for you. Are you seeing any signs that inflation is starting to ease as it works itself through your system? Or was there any mitigation for this cost inflation that is going to be flowing through from the final FY '23 budget resolution? Yes. Rob, inflation is something that we evaluate all the time. In many of our existing contracts, we have not really seen a significant impact, only because I mean our fixed price contracts -- our suppliers are under fixed price contracts with us. Where we have seen is really on new proposals is where we've seen some impacts, where you've got suppliers unwilling to provide longer-term price commitments, requesting what we refer to in the industry as economic price adjustments, which are escalation clauses, inflation clauses. And those are ongoing dialogues that we have with our customers as well. And so it's still an ongoing issue. To be honest with you, on the proposal side, we really haven't seen any type of reduction there in the pressure. It's something that we review quite often on these new proposals, and it's something that we grapple with because either you have to price in some type of inflation assumption into your proposal or you have to have some type of back-to-back agreement where you're going to have an inflation clause. And we're getting squeezed with our customer as well as with our suppliers, and we're trying to make sure that we can accommodate both requirements here. Our next question is from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Just wanted to ask a question here on the new award outlook. Putting FARA aside, if you look at NGI, maybe NGAD and other opportunities, what's the current expectations for timing around some awards, specifically around NGI? And are there other programs out there on the new award side that could significantly move the needle as we think about sort of the potential impact into '24? You think about a few of these, it's something that we have -- I mean you know that the F-35, so we've got waiting for the -- we're expecting the production order on Lot 17 in 2023. We do have a large missile -- air and missile defense program -- international program. It's an important program for us this year. And so it's probably back half of the year type of decision. That is included in our 4 pillars of growth when we talk about new awards. There are other programs here that are classified, really can't get into kind of the detail of those, but we expect some of those awards to be made either at the tail end of this year or into next year as well. And in NGI, we would expect to down-select around 2025. And so there's a fair amount of markers out there in some of these programs that I just spoke between now, really in 2025, that certainly are important to us. Jim mentioned FARA. That's probably a 2025 decision as well. Next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Jay, I think your margins came in a little bit better for 2023 than anticipated your guidance of about 10 bps higher. When we think about your profitability going forward, is this sort of the expected range we should expect? And of your segments, which do you think is the biggest variable? You talked about MFC and some of the challenges there. So maybe if you could talk about that. Yes. Let me maybe talk a bit in the kind of longer-term outlook. And you look at the history of Lockheed Martin over the last probably 5 to 10 years, and we've reached margins in the range of 12%. I do believe we have the potential to get back to those, but that will take time. In the short term, really, I would say, over the next 3 years or so, our objective will be just to hold the margins where they are because some of these pressures that we see on these new programs, particularly at MFC, when you've got a 90 basis point reduction in 1 year from -- in one BA, that's a lot to really overcome. We've worked things internally as far as both product cost reductions, overhead cost reductions to really try to drive and maintain our margin profile. But that's where we're really going to be over the next few years is really trying to maintain where we are as we re-crank the growth cycle. And I think that's the key message that we have had internally: let's re-crank the growth cycle, get ourselves in 2024 on track to deliver the growth. As we get that flywheel turning, then we'll be able to focus and turn back around on margins and start improving margins. Next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. On F-35, so when you get ready to restart here, you've also though now flown the F-35 with tech refresh upgrade -- with Tech Refresh 3 upgrade. Can you talk about how that's progressing, how Tech Refresh 3 is progressing? And how does the progress there play into your delivery plans for Lots 15 through 17? And perhaps you might also comment on, when you get the restart, you've got these airplanes that have already been produced. Should we see those as really add-ons to 2023 deliveries? So Doug, let me take the first portion of your question, it's Jim, and then turn it over to Jay for the second piece on delivery numbers, et cetera. So Tech Refresh 3 is really important in a couple of dimensions. And you're accurate in mentioning and thank you. For the first flight with the TR3 upgraded hardware and software was literally just a few weeks ago. We've got more software releases to go. We're going to add capability over the next couple of months. But we expect production of TR3-capable aircraft hopefully in this -- during the course of this year. That's our expectation. Now what that does for the customer and for us and our strategy is really kind of 2 major dimensions. One is for the capability of the aircraft itself. It will be able to handle more weapons. It will be able to upgrade electronic warfare capabilities. It will be able to accomplish more missions. So the basic functionality of the aircraft alone by itself is going to be elevated significantly by the insertion of this technology. And what is this technology? It's an updated core processor. So the -- basically the server for the airplane that it carries with it is going to the next-generation upgrade. The data storage is going to be vastly improved. And then the display is going to be modernized for the pilot, so what they see, how they interact with the jet and with other aircraft and systems around it. So those 3 things, right, data processing capability and speeds, data storage capacity, and the ability to interconnect with basically a modernized interface for the pilot along with the better capabilities they're going to have to interact with other aircraft to other systems because of TR3 are all of the characteristics that you need for an edge compute node in a modern 5G Internet of things system and architecture, right? The 3 things are data storage, multi-cloud connection and processing power and speed. So we've actually killed two birds with one stone with TR3 here. On one hand, the aircraft is going to be much more capable in the kind of its traditional role. On the second hand, it's going to be way more capable, and perhaps uniquely capable, in sort of the network Internet of things or Joint All Domain Operations of the future, right? That's what our customer calls that. So we have now the computing power and the capacity to serve as sort of the central aerial component of our 21st Century Security open architecture concept. And that's really the 2 pieces of F-35, TR3. They're super important. One is the airplane itself; and second, its ability to network with other systems and aircraft in an IoT-based architecture -- open architecture. Jay, do you want to speak to [Indiscernible] Sure. To answer the question on add-ons, that is -- will be -- that will occur but not necessarily in 2023. If you think about it right now, we're going to be introducing and cutting in new production, hardware and software on a full rate production program, which is a pretty aggressive schedule. And so what I would expect -- and this is included in our sustainment revenue growth projections, we'll see the retrofits on the existing fleet over time. And that will probably start beginning maybe sometime in 2024 and beyond, and it's part of our mid-single-digit sustainment growth on the F-35. Next, we'll go to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. I wanted to ask -- I think you had mentioned some of the restocking of stuff Ukraine and you've got some orders there. How big is that for Lockheed Martin? And how should we think about sort of the timing? And how accretive that might be the growth maybe in '24 and beyond? Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got about -- we had orders of about $1.5 billion. We'll start delivering on some of that in 2023, and that will carry over into 2024. We've got a line of sight to significantly more orders beyond that, that we'll see again in the outer years. And so it's still to be determined. But what I can say is that we have had contract funding and internally funded projects to make sure we can meet higher ramp rates, whether it's HIMARS, GMLRS, PAC-3, all of those, all are opportunities from where we are today and part of the investment that our customer is making and that we are making to drive the higher ramp rates. Yes. And Matt, it's Jim. One of the issues that this situation has illuminated with is that when you need to accelerate production in the defense enterprise for national defense, we would have liked to have been able to, a, ramp up the production faster and, b, bringing the revenue sooner. So it just highlights the need, I think, and it's an urgent one, to work together with government and industry to quickly evolve the relationship between the 2 so that we can maintain an effective deterrent to conflict as we've talked about. So what I'm discussing with some of our senior government officials who are receptive, and they're some real thought leaders in government on this now, is apply the concept of anti-fragility to the relationship between government and industry, meaning things like ensure that we have multiple reliable sources of key materials and components, right? So we have a lot of single-source components that we have to go back down into our supply chain and find out who and if they can double or triple their production of the components so we can double or triple the output of the system. Another piece of this anti-fragility concept is to have the government invest in production capacity with us, call it, 2 standard deviations above the mean of peace time production rates. So if you need to accelerate, you can quickly and start up the line or speed up the line much faster. Another one is significant, expansion of the use of long-term and multiyear contracts so that we don't have to have a fluctuation in demand year-to-year, which sets our supply base back, again, less willing to invest because they can't predict the future. And then finally, especially for those small and medium businesses, we're suggesting that government really take an overview of -- a broad overview of the oversight and compliance burdens that are on companies that participate in the defense industrial base from an audit and compliance and certified cost perspective, truth and negotiation act, things like that, that -- while we at Lockheed Martin and other major defense funds would like to see that burden eased, it's a burden that can really prohibit other medium and small companies from working with us or working with the government to provide what it needs. So there's a great dialogue beginning. I'm sure other companies are raising these issues too. But this issue of restocking raised an important industry issue that we're going to try to work with government to solve. Great. John, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour here, so I'll turn it back to Jim for any last thoughts. Great. Thanks, Maria. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for everything they've done in 2022 and they'll do this year and beyond. Together, we positioned our company to continue to push the edge of the technology and advance scientific discovery to ensure our customers remain what we call ahead of ready and keep people safe around the globe. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in April.  John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day. Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call.  I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO.  Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.   During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.  Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.  I'll turn it over now to Maria. Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. ADP delivered strong Q2 results headlined by 10% organic constant currency revenue growth; 120 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion; and 19% adjusted EPS growth. We continue to deliver exceptional value in the HCM market as we invest in ourselves and innovate to continuously meet and exceed the changing needs of our more than 1 million diverse, local clients.   I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. In Q2, we drove very strong ES new business bookings growth, which included an incredible finish in December. We have continued to see robust demand across our downmarket portfolio and our ES HRO offerings and our international sales performance, especially our GlobalView platform was much stronger in Q2 after a softer Q1.  Overall, we are pleased with our sales results for the first half of the year, and although clients are still dealing with a number of uncertainties, our pipelines are healthy, and we feel well staffed, and well positioned to deliver solid bookings growth for the remainder of the year.   Our ES retention was once again a source of outperformance with modest year-on-year improvement in Q2 overall despite continued normalization in down market out of business rates. This strong result was just shy of the record retention set during the pandemic and was led by our mid-market, our upmarket, and international businesses. And we're pleased to be taking our full year guidance up slightly.   Our pays per control metric was 5% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q1 as we had anticipated. Job growth in the U.S. labor market has been slowing, but clearly remains solid, which you see reflected in our client base. Despite recent headlines noting job cuts by number of companies, we have yet to see broad-based softening in the labor market.   Last, on our PEO, our growth in average worksite employees was solid at 8%. While we have been expecting growth to decelerate over the course of this year, the pace was a bit faster than we previously assumed and we're adjusting our outlook accordingly. With that said, demand for the PEO solution remains healthy. The secular growth opportunity is unchanged, and we are well positioned to reaccelerate our worksite employee growth.   Stepping back from the quarter, I want to provide a quick update on our broader strategy. Over the last several years, you've heard us talk a lot about the modernization of our products. Our simpler user experience enhances ease of use for our key platforms like RUN and Workforce Now, and enables a more seamless integration to complementary solutions like insurance, retirement and payments.   Our Next Gen Payroll engine is a prime example of how we're modernizing the back-end of our solutions, and we continue to offer it to a broader set of new mid-market clients. In brand new solutions like Roll in our Next Gen HCM platform position us to address certain HCM opportunities more fully than before. These product enhancements are designed to drive win rates and retention even higher, and we have tremendous opportunity in front of us. But our strategy has always been about much more than just offering HCM software.   ADP clients want us to help them find, hire, pay, engage, and provide for the retirement of their workers in a thoughtful and compliant way. To truly solve for these needs, we are modernizing all aspects of the client relationship. That starts with product, but also extends to our go-to-market approach, how we onboard our clients, and even how we advise and support them on critical issues.   We refer to this collective effort as our Modernization Journey. And as with our product journey, the opportunities here are incredible. We are removing friction and enhancing the client experience in many ways. In our U.S. down market, we continue to digitally onboard tens of thousands of clients every year, making onboarding easier for our clients and accelerating time to start. We have seen this success in the U.S., and we're beginning to scale the same capability in Canada.   Our Intelligent Self-Service capability launched only last quarter is already helping a portion of our client base answer millions of questions from client employees through a completely automated process. And now in our international portfolio, we're implementing chatbots to reduce work for those clients as well.  We continue to invest in our robust partner ecosystem, cultivating deep relationships and integrations with financial advisers, CPAs and benefits brokers to provide a seamless experience for our mutual clients. And we're using the power of our extensive data to deliver insights to bring greater value to clients from better aligning pays to market trends, to reducing the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, to identifying tax credits and other legislative incentives.   To bring this large-scale Modernization Journey to life, I'll speak to one of our fastest-growing businesses: ADP retirement services, which helps employers establish and administer retirement plans. Businesses today face a complex environment with significant legislative change and our clients look to us to help them navigate these changes, stay compliant and address talent challenges.  For example, in the retirement space specifically, the recently passed SECURE Act 2.0 alone has over 90 provisions for businesses and employees to consider. And what we've designed makes life easy for our clients and partners, improves the financial wellness of their employees, and sets us apart in the market. Our robust 401(k) solution with thousands of different investment options is not only clean and intuitive, thanks to our new UX framework, but is also deeply integrated with RUN and Workforce Now.   Our highly tenured, licensed, retirement services sales force understands our clients and understands which solutions to make a meaningful difference in a client's unique talent strategy. To expand on our partnerships with financial advisers, we recently developed a platform called Advisor Access, much like the Accountant Connect platform we developed for the CPA community years ago. This positions us better to serve our mutual clients and their employees.   And our tax credit team, full of experts in their field, is there to help our clients or their CPAs apply for, and obtain the appropriate legislative incentives. Our goal in our Modernization Journey is to consistently improve the full end-to-end experience for our clients and their employees, which will in turn contribute to our long-term sustainable growth and profitability.  We look forward to keeping you updated.  And now over to Don. Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '23 outlook.  Overall, we had a strong Q2 on both revenue and margins. If I can summarize, we had generally positive developments in our ES segment despite some incremental headwinds. Meanwhile, trends were a little softer than expected in our PEO.   Let me focus on ES first, and I'll cover our results and outlook all at once. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic constant currency basis which was a good outcome for the quarter. Maria mentioned the strong new business bookings performance in Q2. Given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance range for now, although, we feel well positioned for the back half.   We also had near-record ES retention in Q2, with first half ES retention results up year-on-year, we're now revising our outlook and we expect retention to be down only 20 to 30 basis points for the full year. This continues to assume normalization in out-of-business losses in our downmarket.   Pays per control were in line with our expectation in Q2, but with better line of sight on Q3, we are now assuming less of a deceleration in pays per control over the back half than we did previously and are raising our outlook to now assumed 3% to 4% pays per control growth for the year. And on FX, we had about 2 percentage points of revenue headwind in Q2, but the outlook for the rest of the year is slightly improved, and we now expect full year headwind somewhere between 1% and 2%. Those are the bigger positive developments in ES revenue. There were few developments in the other direction as well.   Client funds interest revenue was up nicely in Q2, but was actually a bit lighter than we had planned. This is primarily because yields pulled back slightly from where they were 3 months ago when we provided our prior outlook. We're also tweaking down our balance growth assumption now to 4% to 5% growth for the year due primarily to assumptions around average wage related to worker mix, tax rates as well as the impact of the lapping of the payroll tax deferral. Together, we are lowering the full year by $5 million at the midpoint for revenue and $15 million at the midpoint for net impact to our earnings.  We also saw underperformance in some of our volume-based businesses like our recruitment outsourcing business and our employment verification business. Overall, though, we're feeling good about our ES revenue growth trajectory and are taking up our guidance by 1% to now expecting growth of 8% to 9% for the year.   Our ES margin was up 170 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and there was no change for our full year outlook. As a reminder, we've invested in headcount in sales, product and other areas throughout the organization over the last several quarters as we see continued opportunity to win new clients and further increase satisfaction with existing clients. And although we may scale back as appropriate, at a high level, we feel comfortable with our staffing levels against the secular growth opportunity in front of us.   Moving on to the PEO. We delivered 11% PEO revenue growth in Q2 with 8% growth in average worksite employees. As Maria shared, the PEO results came in a bit softer than expected. The PEO business continues to benefit from long-term tailwinds, but there was a lingering effect from the pandemic, which is still adding variability to our PEO results and outlook. We are, for example, lapping very strong results on retention, bookings and same-store pays. And while the overall trends are playing out consistent with our expectations, we continue to refine our assumptions about pays and magnitude. With that said, we still see a continued solid demand environment in the PEO and the team remains focused on reaccelerating worksite employee growth.   For this fiscal year, we are lowering our PEO revenue outlook to 8% to 9%, driven by growth in average worksite employees of about 6% to 7%. PEO margin in Q2 was up 130 basis points about in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points for fiscal 2023.   Adding it all up, the favorable revision to our ES revenue outlook is largely offset by our lighter PEO revenue growth forecast. And so we continue to expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23. We also maintain our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 to 150 basis points. We still expect our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be about 23%. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17%, supported by our steady share repurchases.   I'll just make one quick comment on cadence. We expect consolidated revenue growth to be relatively steady in Q3 from where we were in Q2. We expect margin expansion to be a bit more modest compared to what we experienced in Q2, closer to 50 to 75 basis points of expansion. There were a few reasons, including the lapping of a onetime item last year, comparisons from a headcount perspective, and certain investments in sales and marketing that we're assuming for Q3. Again, there's no major change contemplated for the full year, but hopefully, this helps you think about Q3.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. On PEO, you mentioned the lingering effects from the pandemic is having an impact. But I was just curious, is the macro environment and I guess, labor market trends impacting PEO differently than ES? Is there more -- is it a question of sensitivity to small versus large market clients? Is it vertical exposure? Or is this really something you see is as quite transient? Thank you, Ramsey. I appreciate the question. So I'll try to cover all the ground on the PEO that you asked about. So specifically, what we saw with respect to the first half, we did see, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see that booking did come in softer. We saw that retention came in a bit softer as well than our expectations.  In terms of the lingering effect that we cited, all of our businesses had an impact from the pandemic. I would say the PEO is probably the one that had the most impact. If you think about all the drivers that constitute the PEO, it's everything from average wages to worker mix to paid unemployment to certainly the lines of insurance, workers' compensation and health benefits.  So I would say it's the business that had the most impact as the pandemic came into the business. And as the pandemic gets flushing out, it is having a lingering effect on the business. I think you touched on what we're seeing with respect to pays per control in the PEO in the context of ES. But I would say is, pays per control is -- the growth rate is decelerating in the PEO. That was expected. If it contributes to the slighter softer performance in the first half and is contributing to the second half.  But the 2 main drivers really behind the performance in the first half as well as the outlook for the second half are bookings and retention. One thing I would say, though, because I want to go back to the strength of that business. We have incredible faith in that business as it relates to the growth from a long-term outlook perspective. The demand is still there. In absolute form from a bookings perspective, the PEO did have growth year-on-year, albeit it was softer than ES and softer than our expectations. Got it. That was super helpful. And just a quick follow-up for me. Tech layoffs have been -- tech sector layoffs have been in the headline recently. I know you guys have a very diversified business, but I thought I'd ask anyway. How exposed are you to that particular vertical? Are you feeling any kind of acute impact from all those headlines kind of layoffs in the technology sector? Yes, Ramsey, it's a good question. I think it's hard to avoid all the headlines that we're seeing day in, day out. And it's fair to say that there's been a number of large names that have announced major layoffs, I'd also with the -- tough to say that some of those clients are -- or some of those people making those layoffs are our clients. But those layoffs are happening around the world in some cases, they're not necessarily our clients in all of our markets.  So I think it's fair to say that we have yet to see any significant impact from all those announcements. And I guess I'll just round it out by saying, we're still seeing stronger or strong demand. We've taken up our pays per control assumption for the back half. And we're doing that not just on our own internal perspective, but we're also looking at the BLS reports, the JOLTS reports. Everywhere you look continues to suggest that there's still strong demand for employment. Unemployment continues to be very low. Unemployment applications are still in record lows. They're not increasing. So the macro environment continues to be very, very favorable for us, irrespective of some of those headlines that we're seeing. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with -- I'm sorry, MoffettNathanson. I wanted to ask about ES bookings. So it sounds like a positive commentary, strong performance there. I think you called out international as coming back strong versus last quarter and also downmarket. Can you talk a little bit about the mid-market? How are the trends there? And yes, I think the key question in everybody's mind is, are you seeing any signs of macro pressure on bookings as companies potentially pulling back their tech spending? We were very pleased with our overall new business bookings for the second quarter. Definitely saw an acceleration in pipelines. I'll get the pipelines in a minute. I did cite the downmarket, the strength that we're seeing in the downmarket, that's really our entire downmarket portfolio. So thinking about our -- obviously, our Run offering, but all the things that tether off of the Run offer, which is the retirement services that I spoke to at length during the prepared remarks, Insurance Services. We did see strength in Employer Services HRO. And then last but not least, one of the other things that I was most pleased to see was the bounce back in international in the second quarter, both in pipelines as well as results. And that was, as mentioned really in our GlobalView space. So very happy with the results, very happy with the strengthening of pipelines. That's what gives us confidence, stepping into the back half as we think about heading toward our guidance of 6% to 9%.  In terms of -- I think you also wanted to know about the mid-market because I didn't cite that specifically. We had very solid yes, very solid mid-market sales, and we continue to see the demand there as a byproduct that is certainly not getting easier for anyone to be an employer, both from a legislative perspective as well as a talent perspective. We have incredible strength in that business as it relates to the product investments we've made.  So think about user experience to what we're attaching with the Next Generation Payroll engine. So we made good product enhancements. We had strong NPS. We have incredible retention results. So the mid-market in general had also a solid sales performance. What I would say is, as you contemplate the mid-market, don't forget that Employer Services HRO, the offer that we call Comprehensive Services fits squarely in that market, and that's an area that experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic, and that growth has sustained and is exceeding the overall Employer Services growth. So altogether, the net results for the mid-market are very, very solid for us. Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for me on pays per control. Your number was very strong this quarter we thought, out from your expectations. But also keeps outperforming by 1 point or 2, kind of the broad measures of labor market growth in the U.S. like nonfarm payrolls. Remind us what's the driver of that? And how sustainable is that as the overall labor market slows down? Can you maintain that 1 to 2-point premium? Yes, it's a good question. But just to remind everyone that, that number is really a mid-market number. So we focus on the mid-market when we provide that pays per control number. And it has been strong. As I mentioned in the earlier answer with respect to the macro environment, the labor market continues to be strong. We're continuing to see our existing clients add employees. As Maria said, bookings are strong. And I think it's the kind of the $64,000 question about how long the labor market can continue to grow. Unemployment can stay so low as we look at some of the headlines and will those things start to converge at some point in the future. But for now, I think we're comfortable with what we've done in terms of taking up the pays per control growth for the back half. And Eugene, just to your point about that spread, having existed in the past, I think typically, we would have expected 2% to 3% pays per control growth in normal economic environment, and that compares to maybe 1% to 2% total employment growth. And that's a function of our clients in general being perhaps a bit healthier than the overall economy, but also the fact that total labor includes things like bankruptcies and new business formation. So it's a slightly different take on employment. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. I wanted to quickly just revisit a little bit, I think you touched on it. But retention and it's an area where we had at least been expecting to see some normalization but -- especially from a company perspective, but it seems to continue to improve or tighten. Obviously, you made technology advancements, et cetera, but what are some other areas, if any, that you'd point to -- that are helping drive that retention performance. Sure. Thanks, James. With respect to retention, we are very, very pleased by the strength that we've seen year-to-date. We cited, at the end of the first quarter, we had record retention. The second quarter was near record. If you look at the first half, it was a record. So we're very proud of the -- not to be a broken record, but the record retention and the strength that we saw -- and we believe that, it is a byproduct of the investments.  I alluded to the investments we've made into the mid-market, as an example of the user experience. That's broad-based now across the RUN platform, our mobile app, our international offer, where we're also in international seeing record retention. So we believe a lot of these things are anchored in just really driving a better user experience, driving the product into a better place.  I think the other is NPS. We have strong service results that's broad-based across the portfolio. I think we generated a tremendous amount of goodwill and value during the pandemic and how we chose to service our clients. And I think that value is -- has continued, and we see that in the results on the NPS side. So I think that's another place.  You did touch on normalization. I think it's an important point to make. We do believe at this point, specifically in the down market, I think we even touched on it during the prepared remarks. We do believe that retention has normalized. When we normalize for average or adjust for average size client, we are back to the downmarket really having out of business and bankruptcies back to fiscal '18, fiscal '19 levels.  So we do believe that the downmarket has normalized. So again, back to kind of the broader retention picture, it is a very strong one for us because we believe at this point, that is broad-based. And it's really a result of the investments and the service levels that we offer. So Maria, that's an interesting point that you're already kind of at least what you think were -- where we should be from a attrition perspective, et cetera, at least compared to where we were pre-COVID.  What are you seeing now from the competitive environment, especially, as we see companies expressing more concern. Are you seeing flight to quality versus some of the regional players or newer entrants? Is that helping you? Just love an update of how the competitive environment factors into what you're seeing overall? The competitive environment is certainly -- on one hand, I could say it continues to evolve. On the other hand, I would tell you, if there's nothing really new to report. I think what we're seeing and we look very closely at our balance of trade, we look very closely at our win rate.  We're measuring all these investments that we make and whether or not they're impacting things such as our balance of trade and such as our win rate. And what I would offer is that, there is a direct correlation between the places we're investing, whether that's the downmarket and our go-to-market brands, headcounts or in the mid-market into the product and the next-generation suite and the win rates that we have. And so we do believe that we're getting stronger in terms of our offer. And I think the record retention is a direct correlation to that. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Maria, you mentioned there was a modernization initiative. I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit on that, just in terms of what we should expect over the next 6 to 18 months in terms of new offerings or increased offerings. And how would that end up impacting both from a revenue as well as from expense perspective? How should we think about that? Sure. I love speaking about the investments we're making into the Modernization Journey. And so perhaps, I can offer the story around the next generation and how we're thinking about the impact of that over the next 16, 18 months from a revenue perspective. And maybe, Don, if you want to cover the margin side.  So Mark, as it relates to our overall modernization initiatives, there is all the things that I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is around tools, technology, removing friction, taking work out. Last quarter alone, we talked about Intelligent Self-Service, Voice of the Employee. So these are bespoke features, functionality that were layering into our offers, and into our platforms to make them more competitive and bring more value to the market.  With respect to the next generation platforms, I touched briefly on Next Generation HCM. We've given updates of that over time. And I think we continue to see us implement our backlog, continue to build scale, build implementation. Our goal would be -- to use your time horizon over the next 16 to 18 months that we would open the aperture to have that suite specifically sold across a broader set of the upmarket clients.  In terms of the Next Generation Payroll, which is what we are offering attached to Workforce Now in the mid-market. We continue to make progress on Next Generation Payroll, pretty excited about that progress from a quarter perspective. Every quarter, there's an increase of the number of clients that we are attaching the Next Gen Payroll towards Workforce Now. So I think from Q4 to Q1, we had more. From Q1 to Q2 -- or Q2 to Q1, we had more. As continue again to attach more and more, we're running about 30% to 40% attached.  So again, using your time frames over the next 16 -- 6 to 18 months, our goal would be to continue to more broadly offer and scale that offering across specifically, our mid-market. We're seeing, again, great signs on win rates, things like that.  I think the other initiative I would speak to is Roll. Very excited about our project that we -- or it's not project, our product that we call Roll, which is really the downmarket product that we're offering to an incremental buyer that digital native. And so again, it's exceeding all of its project milestones. We're learning. We're continuing to understand how a digital buyer wants to consume payroll end-to-end in a digital capacity. And we believe over the next 6 to 18 months that we will learn more and as such, we will scale it across.  In terms of the impacts to revenue, I would tell you, revenue over the next 6 to 18 months, I'm not sure that any of those projects will make a meaningful impact to the revenue. They certainly will make any meaningful impact to bookings. And as we onboard those clients, that will generate new revenue lines for us, whether that's an upmarket, our Next Gen HCM, it's a broader piece to the mid-market, our Next Gen Payroll. And then in the downmarket in the micro market that Roll addresses, it take a lot of units for it to make a meaningful revenue impact to the broader ADP. But that's the -- the excitement is really in the offers, and offers being able to drive win rates and retention and changing the competitive narrative. So with that, I'll kind of stop and I'll let Don speak to any margin impact. Yes, Mark, I'll just follow up on Maria's comments. I think the adoption of these products is exciting and doing well. And as we have the adoption increase quarter to quarter, we expect to see improvements in revenue from these new offers. But I think at the same time, the penetration rate within our 1 million existing clients is going to take some time to achieve.  So the margin impacts from those new sales and those clients is going to take some time to make its way through to the bottom line, so to speak. But I would say that we -- you've heard us often speak about transformation of these calls over the last few years. And I would say that internally, I think our biggest transformation exercise, our biggest transformation opportunity is coming from these new products themselves. So we are excited about these new offers, and we do think they're going to -- they're going to help us out in the future. That's terrific. And then obviously, in the headlines, everybody is concerned about what could potentially occur from a macro perspective in terms of, if we go into a recession, ADP has obviously got a stellar long-term track record of navigating successfully through recessions.  But I'm wondering, what's your philosophy going to be Maria, if we go into a recession in terms of thinking about expenses, margins, et cetera. Would you just focus on the long term? Or would you do things in a short-term manner to adjust expenses? We do have a recession playbook, if you will. I think the first thing that happens is, we adjust things such as our go-to-market. When you think about how we address talent needs on the way up in an economy, it's kind of the converse on the way down. So that's not to suggest that the business wouldn't be impacted. The things that would be impacted are things like bookings. And the reason I bring that up is, it is somewhat self-adjusting, right, as it relates to the action.  So in the absence of bookings, there is also the absence of expense. So some of that self-adjust, thinking selling commissions, overall incentive comp. We could also, as a byproduct of that, if there's lower volume on the sales side coming in, we would have lower volume on the implementation side and potentially lower volume on the service side. And so there will be, maybe a pullback in hiring things of that nature. And these are all playbooks that we've run before, a few times in my lifetime.  We may add that juncture, choose to prioritize key investments differently, depending on what's happening. But we're going and we're very committed to continuing the work we've been doing on Modernization and on transformation. And I think one of the big lessons for us whether it was this most recent pandemic downturn, if you will, an event or it was the last -- the financial crisis or even the -- I've been here long enough to be a part of the 2000, call it, dot-com, et cetera, bust.  And what I would say is, our investments in growth will be maintained. I think that's the key is ensuring that we make smart decisions during a downturn so that when we come out of the downturn, we're positioned to execute quickly. I think we made some very wise decisions, specifically, on the go-to-market, on the seller side during the pandemic that allowed us -- we were lucky because it was short and steep and fast.  And as everything opened back up, we were well positioned to take advantage of that market because of the investments that we continue to make. So to answer your question, I think most of the changes that we would make are somewhat self-adjusting in their nature, if bookings were impacted. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. First one I had is on pricing. So just any change in view around ES pricing, any change in claim acceptance to the higher levels that I think you were contemplating when you entered the fiscal year, just given the macro? Yes, Bryan, thanks for the question. I think it's a relatively short answer. The fact is our prices are holding well. As a matter of fact, I would say that we are kind of at the high end of the guidance we gave previously, and we're comfortable with that. I think if we look at our retention, we look at our NPS scores, it appears that those price increases have been understood and accepted as well, as could be expected. Okay. Good to hear. And then on the international front. So can you just talk about what you saw in Europe here that drove the better performance in the quarter.  And you cited U.S. pays per control here in the earnings material, what does that imply in the Europe base? So I'm curious not just on the employment level but also the demand, whether there's really any particular solutions that drove that better performance or different underlying behavior in that base versus U.S? We were very pleased by the improvement that we saw in international bookings. It was driven mainly by our GlobalView offer and a bit of our in-country business. So very excited about what we saw specifically, as it relates to performance in the second quarter. But also about pipelines, right?  So a quarter ago, I was on this call citing that we believe that there was some pipeline depletion that happened specifically in international. So pipelines that were pulled into last fiscal year. International was one of the businesses that had an incredibly strong fourth quarter finish. And so we did see a need during the first quarter to rebuild pipelines. The great news is those pipelines were rebuilt and we saw that execution in the second quarter. It's also what gives us optimism as we head into the back half. So very excited about international.  And as optimistic as I am, it is an area that we're still continuing to watch for all the obvious things, I said. Last quarter, which is, there's still the crisis in the Ukraine. There's still the energy crisis. It is also an area that we see a tiny bit of pipeline aging. And so international remains a watch item for us, albeit, very excited about the pipeline build and the results in the second quarter. And I think you asked about pays per control in international? Yes. Bryan, pays per control for our international pays tends to be more subdued than what we have in the U.S. in both directions. And so early pandemic, it didn't fall very much at all. And in the recovery, subsequent, we had less growth there. So that's continued. . Yes. So just maybe -- so the government programs that are in place and the kind of the social aspect, if you will, of European employment means that things don't go down very quickly. And as a result, they don't recover very quickly as well because they don't have much to recover from. So that's a good for consistency, if you will, continuity of earnings. So that's -- that works in our favor in these -- when times are trying. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Hope you can hear me. Maria, I think I heard you say you were looking to reposition PEO growth. If that's the case, can you elaborate on that? I'm just trying to think if the implied second half growth in WSE volume within PEO, that's a good number to start from. As we look to next year, could growth get better or worse from there? Or how quickly can the repositioning, benefit of the volume outlook? The comment that I made was really about bookings. And so we are looking to reaccelerate bookings in the back half. For PEO, as mentioned, it was a bit softer in the first half. In terms of the question of when we anticipate the reacceleration, the well-positioned reacceleration and worksite employee growth, we don't anticipate that it will be in the next couple of quarters. So not a position to necessarily give guidance for next year. But we are lapping -- as mentioned in the remarks, we are lapping record retention, record bookings. And as some of that lapping happens, we believe we're well positioned to reaccelerate works on employee growth into next year. Got it. Perfect. And then just on Retirement Services, since you mentioned it, in your prepared remarks. Any update on penetration there across the major lines? And if there's any change in the outlook or the model there. Sure. So it's safe to say that business is outperforming its targets. It has great growth. We do have -- and last week, we talked about it, we do have 125,000 plans across that business. It's primarily an SMB space, a little bit into the mid-market and even upmarket. But nonetheless, if you just think of it in the SMB context and with the new SECURE Act and -- which is the 2.0 version of the 1.0 and all the state mandates. At this juncture, we have 125,000 of 800,000-ish Run clients that take advantage of the offer.  So you can kind of think about the opportunity in that way. That's not to suggest that every single one of those Run clients could be a retirement plan, but even if we were to capture a bit of that. We do believe, and it's part of the reason I'm so excited about it is because it does continue to outperform its growth targets. And we believe there's tremendous runway for growth in Retirement Services over the coming years. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. I just wanted to ask one on the volume-based parts of the businesses that you mentioned, particularly on the employment verification. I was just wondering if you could help us understand how much did that contribute? And what are the assumptions going forward? Are you assuming that there will just be less activity around employment verification? Or do you think it was just seasonally lower? Just how should we think about that since you called it out this quarter. Okay. So let me talk about the 2 volume businesses that we referenced in the prepared remarks. The first one would be the RPO business, the recruitment outsourcing. That business was down and that business is not a very big business for us. And most of it is focused in the upmarket. Most of the clients we have there are in the enterprise space. And I think that is an area, of course, where we are seeing something internally that correlates more with some of the headlines that we're seeing in the press. But it's not a very big business for us, and it did come down.  On the employment verification business, of course, mostly and significantly related to the mortgage market. We don't share the number that EV business is part of our broader $1 billion comprehensive services business. It's meaningful for us. From a revenue perspective, it's more meaningful for us, if you will, from a margin perspective because it's above-average margin business. Hence, we called it out.  But our expectations as we look forward is, we do expect there to be softness in the mortgage market in the back half of the year. And we've reflected those expectations and those forecasts into the numbers that we're sharing with you today. Great. And then maybe just a housekeeping question on the rate side. So just so we understand it. When the company gives the forward outlook for the float revenue guidance. Are you assuming -- I'm assuming the tenure that's come in at the short end of the curve has actually gone up. So is it -- should we assume that the tenure at current levels is what you're now forecasting going forward? I'm just trying to -- we're just trying to make sure that we get it correct, the inter-quarter moves and how we should think about that on the guidance of that. . Yes. So since we presented -- since we gave guidance last quarter, rates have come down, particularly on the mid and the long rates. And even though short-term rates have increased, some of our short-term borrowing costs in our commercial paper program. So the rates that we're giving and the reason we take in our client fund interest forecast down a little bit at the midpoint, is to reflect those increased borrowing rates and the softening, if you will, of interest rates in the mid and the longer term. Yes. Samad, thanks for asking that question because I know we take a slightly different approach than some of our peers. But even when you think about the short end of the yield curve, what is currently baked into market expectations is also what baked into our outlook for the year.  So even if the Fed raises rates, that does not necessarily suggest upside to what we had previously guided. And to Don's point, at the longer -- the mid and longer end of the yield curve, you actually saw a decline. And so we share in our earnings release the incremental yield on new purchases and that declined from, I think, 4.3% last quarter to 4.1% this quarter. So in other words, we're getting less in the mid and long end of the yield curve, and we're getting more or less what we expected in the short. And our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. I wanted to come back on PEO for a second and maybe piggybacking on Tien-Tsin's question. Just as we think about the second half of the fiscal year. It looks like the revenue growth is going to come in 5%, 6%. And then you talked about getting to some easier comps and some reacceleration. But are you thinking any differently about the medium-term guide for PEO? I think that was 10% to 12% when you provided that at the Analyst Day. So the medium-term guide, all of the medium-term guides were somewhat aspirational in their nature, and we're not sitting here today making changes to any of our medium-term guide. I think, again, when I think about the PEO outlook, just a reminder, because I said it earlier on the call, but I think it is an important point. The demand has been incredibly strong still for the PEO. It is still growing nicely through the second quarter. Technically was year-on-year growth. It just wasn't what we had expected, and it decelerated a bit earlier than we thought.  And so when we think about kind of the back half of the PEO, we do expect bookings to reaccelerate. As mentioned, we expect works on employees to not accelerate in the coming quarters, but we're well positioned to do so as we lap the compares into next year. But I think the big piece -- by the way, even retention was healthy.  Retention is right in line with really where it's been in the last decade. I spent a lot of years in that business. And I've seen this as nothing abnormal, if you will. It's really just the byproduct of some lingering effects from the pandemic, which is not that different than some of the strangeness that we experienced during ACA in that business.  And so what I would say is, demand is healthy, bookings is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be on tough compares. Retention is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be, again, on tough compares. And we feel well positioned in that business to accelerate and very excited about its long-term growth opportunity for us. Yes. Sorry. And at the same time, remember, at Investor Day, we said that we were expecting high single-digit growth in average worksite employees. So I think we're still very much on that track and pretty much committed to that. . Okay. Appreciate that. Just wanted to follow up on -- so on the pays per control side, obviously, you upticked the guide there. But we have seen in the temp labor market, there's been some material declines in recent months. I'm just wondering how you guys think about the temp labor market relative to broader labor market conditions. And your business with some kind of potential lag? Just any views there would be helpful. Yes. Jason, I think... Sorry, I will -- let me start. Maybe Danny can add some color. I think some of the leading indicators we look at -- so look at the JOLTS report, we look at the job postings, et cetera, those still seem to be healthy. It is -- I mean, the open positions, the until positions are certainly declining, but they still remain at healthy levels compared to pre-pandemic levels. So I think that would be an indicator we look at. And I think there's still some room there before they get back to what we saw pre-pandemic. So I guess we'll continue to pay attention to it. We're focused on it. But at this point in time, things still feel to be pretty healthy. Yes. Jason, exactly to that point. It's one of many leading indicators that we look at. And for sure, things are slowing, given where we are with employment and 3.5% unemployment rate. So it's not a question of whether we expect the monthly jobs growth to slow over the next several months, I think that's more or less assumed. But the question is, at these employment levels to get that type of growth is still a very healthy outcome. And so I think that's how we would characterize the overall environment today. We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Maybe Maria or Don, as you look at the PEO business and is -- are you seeing any more competition in the business? Could that be a part of maybe you're seeing? Or is this just that you need to reposition the business a little bit and the business was so strong that the comparisons are difficult. I think the business was so strong. I think the compares were difficult. We plan for deceleration. It happened faster. We do not see a competitive change or landscape that exists. Again, in terms of where that business gets its business from, that 50-50 split between kind of new clients coming in as well as upgrades as well as where we actually return clients that leave. Certainly, there is PEO to PEO switching, but it's a very small piece to the overall results on the booking side or the impact on retention. And we're not seeing -- again, we look at balance of trade, we look at win rates and we do not see a meaningful change in the competitive landscape. . And then maybe Don and Danny, I know you're talking about leading indicators and Don, you talked about the JOLTS report, and I assume we have lots of other statistics. But I'm wondering, are you able to look at the customers you have and the demand they see for employees? And if you kind of compare that to what you saw 3, 6 months ago. Are you able to do that? And if so, maybe what you might see in that type of -- those type of statistics? Yes. I mean, I think the way we look at that, Kartik, is through the pays per control growth. And so as we went from 7% growth in Q1 down to 5% and we were looking to be a bit flatter in the back half, although we've become a little bit more optimistic on that as time has gone on. So I think that would be the key area where we kind of take a look and see what the demand is with our installed client base. Yes. Beyond that, Kartik, we do have some recruitment solutions beyond the recruitment outsourcing one that Don spoke about earlier. And so we have, for example, data on the total number of job postings that our clients have. And if you were to look back, that would typically track JOLTS, the trends would be very similar.  Now that said, clearly, you could be in an environment where people have job postings and then they decide to pull them. So how accurate that is, how great of a leading indicator that is, it's hard to say. But at the same time, we have live data on pays per control as Don points out. So we know with precision how many people are being added week-to-week. That's healthy. The job postings are healthy. Granted there are some signs of deceleration, layoffs and temp, but the bigger picture is still healthy. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you to all of you on the phone today for your thoughtful questions. As you heard from our tone today, very pleased with the first half, excited about how we're positioned for the second half against our updated guidance.  Again, everything that we do every day is all about solving for clients in the world of work. And with that, I think it'd be appropriate for me to thank the 60,000-plus associates that are out there every day doing that work for our clients, for their workers and bringing meaningful value into the world of work and into the world of HCM. So thank you to all the associates. Thanks to all the analysts and the investors for your support and your continued support. We certainly appreciate it and we look forward to keeping you updated and speaking with you again soon. Thanks so much. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

         "Thank you for standing by. Welcome to AT&T's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.   I would like to turn the conference call over to our host, Amir Rozwadowski, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter call. I'm Amir Rozwadowski, Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me today on the call are John Stankey, our CEO; and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. It says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they're subject to risks and uncertainties described in AT&T's SEC filings. Results may differ materially. Additional information as well as our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website.   With that, I'll turn the call over to John Stankey. John? Thanks, Amir, and Happy New Year, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today, and I hope you enjoyed a restful and healthy holiday season. And at the conclusion of this call, I'm declaring the statute of limitations on this being the new year has run out. I'll share upfront that our commentary is a bit longer than usual. However, we thought it was important to provide a bit more clarity on our business today, primarily our fiber strategy since we haven't had an opportunity to discuss our December GigaPower joint venture announcement. Still, we'll ensure we have enough time to get to most of your questions. As I reflect on not only this past year, but the past 2.5 years, it's clear that our teams have worked diligently to refocus AT&T around a connectivity strategy has simplified our company and positioned it for sustainable growth. Our results over the past 10 quarters demonstrate we are on our way to delivering the full promise of the strategy. We're operating a streamlined and return-focused business with an improved profit trajectory that's committed to generating sustained cash earnings growth while delivering an attractive dividend. Underpinning all of our actions is a deep desire to connect our customers with greater possibility through 5G and fiber. And importantly, we're assembling the right assets, talent and capital structure to offer an experience and value proposition that customers appreciate. Our fourth quarter results are the latest example of how our teams continue to consistently deliver for our customers. We finished 2022 with strong momentum in growing customer relationships. As you can see from our profitability trends, we're growing them in the right way. So let me highlight some of our progress. Let's start with wireless. We delivered 656,000 postpaid phone net adds in the fourth quarter and nearly 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds for the full year. And over the past 2.5 years, we've increased our postpaid phone base by nearly 7 million to 69.6 million subscribers which represents our best 10-quarter stretch of wireless growth more than a decade. During the same 10-quarter time span, we've grown wireless service revenues, EBITDA and also increased our postpaid phone ARPU by nearly $1. And while others may have jumped the gun, they claim that they were the only ones to reduce churn in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, we also lowered our fourth quarter postpaid and postpaid phone churn without offering richer promotions or free line giveaways. We consider this yet another data point highlighting that our comprehensive approach to improving the entire customer experience is working from our simplified go-to-market strategy, to our better network experience, to our focused market segmentation practices. On top of that, our growth was not only robust but profitable with 2022 being the most profitable year ever for our mobility business. We expect profit growth to continue in 2023 as we benefit from the investments we've made in our business over the last 2.5 years. Our network teams have also consistently outpaced our mid-band 5G spectrum rollout objective. In fact, we now reach 150 million mid-band 5G POPs, more than double our initial 2022 year-end target. Our goal remains to deploy our spectrum efficiently and in a manner that supports traffic growth. In the markets where we have broadly deployed mid-band 5G, 25% of our traffic in these areas already takes advantage of our mid-band spectrum. Now let's move to fiber where we build fiber, we continue to win. We had more than 1.2 million AT&T fiber net adds last year. The fifth straight year, we've totaled more than 1 million AT&T fiber net adds. And after 2.9 million AT&T fiber net adds over the last 2.5 years, we've now reached an inflection point where our fiber subscribers outnumber our non-fiber DSL subscribers. The financial benefits of our fiber focus are also becoming increasingly apparent as full year fiber revenue growth of nearly 29% has led to sustainable revenue and profit growth in our Consumer Wireline business. As we scale our fiber footprint, we also expect to drive margin expansion. In summary, we're enhancing and expanding our networks while extending our long runway for sustainable growth. And I'm very happy with the high quality and consistent customer adds we achieved last year. We've emphasized that our plan was to grow customer relationships in a thoughtful and responsible way grounded by an enhanced value proposition that resonated with customers. That's exactly what our teams have done, quarter after quarter. In addition to growing customer relationships, we've executed some of the most challenging actions associated with repositioning our operations. We've doubled down on our cost transformation. We've now achieved more than $5 billion of our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target. In 2023, you can expect the benefits from these efforts to increasingly fall to the bottom line. In fact, you've already seen the benefits of this cost transformation beginning to translate into operating leverage despite inflationary pressures. Our teams did an excellent job implementing pricing actions and business efficiencies to offset continued inflationary impacts, the impacts we anticipate will be with us in the near to midterm. Part of tapping into these efficiencies entails improving acquisition costs and further streamlining our operations and distribution. Another part entails rationalizing our Wireline copper infrastructure and reinvesting those savings into fiber and wireless where we're seeing improving returns. As we look at our last priority, we also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow even with record levels of investment. This gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering an attractive dividend today and in the future, while also improving the credit quality of that dividend as we expect to increase our cash generation over time. We strengthened our balance sheet last year, reducing our net debt by about $24 billion. So as we close 2022, I'm proud of what the AT&T team accomplished despite a competitive market and challenging macro environment. Turning to 2023, what's our strategy? Well, it's simple. Do it again. What exactly does that mean? It means we're focused on the same 3 operational and business priorities we set in place 2.5 years ago. As I've mentioned time and again, our north star remains solely focused on becoming the best connectivity provider with 5G and fiber. We're confident we can achieve this because in wireless, we'll maintain our focus on building durable and sustainable customer growth in a rational, return-focused manner. Just as we've done over the past 10 quarters, we'll continue to take a disciplined approach to selectively target underpenetrated areas of the consumer and business marketplace and improve the perception and execution of our value proposition. We also expect to continue our 5G expansion, reaching more than 200 million people with mid-band 5G by the end of 2023. In wired broadband, we have the nation's largest and fastest-growing fiber Internet, and we expect continued healthy subscriber growth as we grow our fiber footprint. As we keep expanding our subscriber base will drive efficiencies in everything we do. This includes consistently elevating our customer experience through the improved durability and reliability of our 5G and fiber networks. When we couple our evolving networks with further enhancements to our distribution and digital and self-service channels will make a competitive customer experience even more appealing. We expect to realize additional benefits from our consistent go-to-market strategy and lower cost structures we also benefit from our improved brand perception, strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers. Additionally, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our $6 billion plus cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. We expect even more of these savings to fall to the bottom line as the year progresses. With that improved performance, we remain focused on further strengthening the balance sheet by using cash after dividends to reduce debt as we progress toward our target of a 2.5x range for net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Our commitment to providing an attractive annual dividend also remains firm. As our CapEx is expected to moderate exiting this year, following the peak investment levels of 2022 and 2023, we expect the credit quality of our dividend to improve on the back of our higher free cash flow and improved financial flexibility. In summary, we feel confident that our growth and profit trends are sustainable despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. As I stated previously, we continue to expect that we will be operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment where wireless industry growth is likely to return to more normalized levels. The resiliency of the services we provide are time-tested and only growing in importance. When you couple this resiliency with the investments we've made to our networks and proven go-to-market strategy, we're confident in our ability to navigate potential economic headwinds that may emerge and our improving financial flexibility only further strengthens that confidence. Now I'd like to take a moment to touch upon our fiber strategy by quickly level setting on how I'm thinking about the success we've had, our plans for the next few years and how we'll hold ourselves accountable. Similar to the early days of wireless, we consider fiber, a multiyear opportunity that will transform the way consumers and businesses growing connectivity needs are met in the ensuing decade and beyond. For AT&T, we segment this opportunity into 3 distinct buckets based on the specific input parameters and return dynamics each one possesses. The first is our in-footprint build where we can take advantage of our existing infrastructure, deep insights on both the customer base and competitive landscape and our market presence in order to take share and deliver attractive returns. We believe our performance over the last few years supports the wisdom of allocating our capital to these opportunities with sustainable and solid return characteristics. As we stated previously, we currently size this opportunity is passing 30 million-plus consumer and business locations within our existing wireline footprint by the end of 2025. We finished last year with approximately 24 million fiber locations passed, including businesses, of which more than 22 million locations are sellable, which we define as our ability to serve. Our build to these locations is providing great returns, as you can see from our growing fiber revenues and ARPUs. As a general rule, about 5% of consumer locations passed may not be immediately sellable, primarily due to timing factors such as building access, construction or vacancies. Over time, we expect more of this inventory to become addressable for sale.  We remain on track to reach our target of 30 million plus past locations by the end of 2025. The simple math would suggest 2 million to 2.5 million consumer and business locations passed annually moving forward. As we previously shared, build targets will vary quarter-to-quarter in any given year based on how the market is evolving. The second bucket is availing ourselves a partnership opportunities to not only expand but also accelerate our coverage in excess of that 30 million-plus location target. This is where our recent GigaPower joint venture announcement with a BlackRock infrastructure fund resides. While this deal is not yet closed, we're very excited about the expected benefits. Through this endeavor, GigaPower plans to use a best-in-class operating team to deploy fiber to an initial 1.5 million locations, and I would expect that number to grow over time. This innovative risk-sharing collaboration will allow us to prove out the viability of a different investment thesis that expanding our fiber reach not only benefits our fiber business, but also our mobile penetration rates. But what makes me most enthusiastic about this endeavor is that we believe GigaPower provides us long-term financial flexibility and strategic optionality and what we believe is the definitive access technology for decades to come, all while sustaining near-term financial and shareholder commitments.   If I were to draw parallel to this partnership approach, I'm reminded the early days of wireless where the race to grow footprint was somewhat time-bound and facilitated by a similar approach ultimately culminating in today's national networks. The last bucket is framed by opportunities to connect people who previously did not have access to best-in-class technologies through broadband stimulus and BEAD funding. As I shared before, we truly believe that connectivity is a bridge to possibility in helping close the digital divide by focusing on access to affordable high-speed Internet is a top priority of AT&T. The intent of these government programs is to provide the necessary funding and support to allow both AT&T and the broader service provider community that means to invest alongside the government at the levels needed to achieve the end state of a better connected America. As the year progresses, we expect to gain more clarity around additional opportunities that exist, none of which are included in the $30 million plus fiber location target I've mentioned. As we compete for the subsidy, we'll bring our operational and market experience to compete for contracts in a disciplined manner. In doing so, we may be the only participant that has the ability to bid as part of an embedded wireline operation, a scaled national wireless provider and GigaPower may participate as a focused and flexible commercial open access wireline fiber network.  We think this will prove to be a winning combination in pursuit of attractive growth. The bottom line is this. Our commitment to fiber is at the core of our strategy. In footprint, we're on track to deliver our $30 million-plus location commitment and we're building the strategic and financial capabilities to take advantage of further opportunities as they emerge.  To wrap up, regardless of what transpires in the macro economy in the year ahead, we remain confident in the resiliency of the services our customers depend on in their daily lives. I believe our plan for the year rings true to who we are at our core. For almost 150 years, AT&T has invested heavily into connecting our country. And in the process of doing so, we provided a spark for innovation that connects people to greater possibility. This year, we'll continue to honor this heritage by significantly investing in best-in-class technology to build on a foundation for the future of our country's evolving connectivity needs, needs that we expect to grow significantly in the coming years. With that, I'll turn it over to Pascal. Pascal? Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Since John already discussed the great momentum we have this past year in growing our customer base in 5G and fiber, I'd like to start by taking a look at our fourth quarter financial summary on Slide 8. First, as a reminder, with the close of the WarnerMedia transaction in April, historical financial results have been recast to present WarnerMedia and certain other divested businesses as discontinued operations. Therefore, where applicable, I will highlight our financial results on a comparative like-for-like basis.  For the fourth quarter, revenues were up nearly 1%. On a comparative basis, revenues for the full year were up around 2%, largely driven by wireless service revenue and, to a lesser extent, broadband in Mexico. This was partly offset by a decline in business wireline.  Adjusted EBITDA was up about 8% for the quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was up around 3.5% on a comparative basis as growth in mobility, consumer wireline in Mexico were partly offset by a decline in business wireline. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.61, up about 9% for the quarter primarily due to strong organic growth in mobility and lower interest and benefit-related expenses.  For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.57. I should note that we've taken a $24.8 billion noncash goodwill impairment charge in conjunction with our annual goodwill assessment primarily due to increases in discount rates associated with the overall rise in interest rates. We also took a noncash charge of $1.4 billion to abandon certain conduit assets related to the ongoing rationalization of our copper network. Free cash flow for the quarter was $6.1 billion, including about $800 million in DIRECTV distributions. This is an improvement of $780 million year-over-year, even with a $1 billion lower distribution from DIRECTV and $500 million less in FirstNet capital reimbursements. We also delivered on our revised full year guidance with free cash flow of $14.1 billion for the year. Cash from operating activities for our continuing operations came in at $10.3 billion for the quarter, up $2.3 billion year-over-year. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $4.2 billion with capital investments of $4.7 billion. Full year capital investment marked an all-time high at $24.3 billion as we continue to make record investments in 5G and fiber.  Now let's look at our mobility segment operating results on Slide 9. For the fifth consecutive year, our mobility business grew both revenues and EBITDA. Revenues were up 1.7% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Service revenues were up more than 5% for both the quarter and the year, driven by continued subscriber growth. This exceeds the raised annual guidance we provided to you last quarter.  Mobility EBITDA was up about $740 million or more than 10% for the quarter, driven by growth in service revenues, transformation savings and the absence of 3G network shutdown costs versus the fourth quarter of 2021. This was partially offset by higher bad debt levels. For the full year, mobility EBITDA grew nearly 4%. Even as competitors introduce richer promotional offers during the holiday seasons, our consistent go-to-market approach once again drove our results. This gives us confidence that we have the right formula and structure in place to continue to grow customers, service revenues and EBITDA at a healthy clip this year. Mobility postpaid phone ARPU was $55.43, up $1.37 or 2.5% year-over-year. ARPU growth continues to come in ahead of our expectation and largely reflects our targeted pricing actions, customers trading up to higher price unlimited plans and improved roaming trends. As John previously mentioned, postpaid phone churn of 0.84% for the quarter declined year-over-year even as we were less promotional compared to our peers. We believe that this decline is reflective of our improved customer value proposition. In prepaid, our phone churn was less than 3% driven by cricket phone churn that was substantially lower than 3%. While we believe industry wireless subscriber volumes will continue to pace towards normalized levels this year, we also expect our consistent go-to-market strategy to help us deliver strong relative performance and ongoing customer growth.  Now let's move to Consumer and Business Wireline results, which are on Slide 10. Let's start with consumer wireline. As John mentioned, our fiber customer growth and network expansion continue. And wherever we have fiber, we win share. We added 280,000 fiber customers even in a seasonally slow fourth quarter that was impacted by lower year-over-year household move activities and challenging December weather conditions. The increasing mix shift from legacy products to fiber drove strong broadband results, and we expect these trends to continue. Broadband revenues grew more than 7% year-over-year due to fiber subscriber growth and higher ARPU from the mix shift to fiber. Fiber ARPU was $64.82, up $2.20 sequentially with intake ARPU now approaching $70. Consumer wireline EBITDA grew over 20% for the quarter and nearly 10% for the full year due to growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings.  Turning to business wirelines. EBITDA was relatively flat for the quarter due to $90 million in intellectual property transaction revenues and ongoing transformation savings as we continue to rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. In fact, margins were up 110 basis points year-over-year, thanks to our transformation process. This rationalization process will continue in 2023 as we remain focused on the opportunities that our 5G and fiber expansion create in the small and midsized business category. Our Business Solution wireless services revenue grew more than 7%. This is very impressive given the fact that we already have the second largest share and are growing faster than our peers. FirstNet wireless connections grew by $377,000 sequentially.  Now let's move to Slide 11 for our 2023 financial guidance. Let me walk you through how we're thinking about operating expectations for 2023. First, we expect to continue to grow mobility subscribers against a return to a more normalized industry growth. We also expect continued benefits from a larger subscriber base and improving ARPUs. This should result in wireless service revenue growth of 4% plus for the full year.  For broadband, we expect revenue increases of 5% plus reflecting a higher mix shift to fiber with improving ARPUs partially offset by continued legacy revenue declines. Overall, we expect to grow total revenues next year. However, as you all know, variability in equipment revenues driven by industry volumes could be a factor on consolidated top line trends as we think about EBITDA trends in 2023. We expect to grow mobility EBITDA mid-single digits as our disciplined approach helps us grow our valuable subscriber base.  In business wireline, we expect EBITDA to be down high single digits due to continued declines in legacy products, partially offset by incremental cost savings and increased fiber-based revenues. As you consider the first quarter for Business Wireline, it's worth noting that 2022 included a onetime incentive compensation benefit that will impact year-over-year comparisons. In Consumer Wireline, we expect to grow EBITDA in a mid-single-digit range, plus or minus, due to continued growth in fiber revenues and transformation savings, partially offset by continued declines in legacy copper subscribers. We expect to benefit from ongoing corporate cost reductions. Altogether, this yields consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% plus for the full year.  When you think about adjusted EPS calculations, note that our guidance reflects nearly $0.20 per share of headwinds associated with noncash pension costs related to higher interest rates and to a lesser extent, lower spectrum interest capitalization. Importantly, we have no need to fund our pension plans for the foreseeable future. We also expect to incur more than $0.05 of noncash headwinds related to a higher effective tax rate of around 23% to 24%.  Combined, these headwinds aggregates to about $0.25 year-over-year.  Normalizing for these noncash items, our guidance would imply adjusted EPS growth consistent with our expected growth in adjusted EBITDA. Given these assumptions, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $2.35 to $2.45 range. We also expect adjusted equity income from DIRECTV to be about $3 billion for the year versus $3.4 billion in 2022. Here's what to consider when looking at our free cash flows for 2023. First, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% plus. Next, expect cash interest to be down about $500 million. Assume your cash taxes will be higher in 2023 versus 2022 to the tune of about $1 billion. And expected cash distributions from DIRECTV should be down about $1 billion. We continue to expect that 2022 and 2023 will be our peak investment year. So capital investment is expected to be consistent with 2022 levels. We also expect about of $2 billion of working capital improvements, largely from lower deferrals and higher noncash amortization of deferred acquisition costs. As we mentioned earlier, we expect a more normalized industry growth volume which is expected to help working capital as well. When you combine all these factors, you get to a free cash flow expectation of $16 billion or better. This is about twice as much as our current annualized dividend and more than enough to cover other commitments.  Similar to last year, we expect greater free cash flow generation in the back half of the year based on higher capital investment levels and device payments in the first half of the year as well as the timing of the annual incentive compensation payout. We will use our free cash flows to pay out our dividend and to pay down debt as we continue to progress towards our target of 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which we anticipate will take place in early 2025.  And lastly, the guidance we provided to you is based on our current reporting. We expect our segment reporting in 2023 will remain the same as last year. However, I'd like to note that we no longer plan to record prior service credit benefits to the individual business segments with a corporate elimination. Instead, it will only be recorded in other income.  Overall, we are confident in our plan for the year. And as John mentioned, it takes into account our expectations for a more normalized industry growth backdrop against continued challenges in the macro environment. Our confidence is underscored by the resiliency of the services we offer, the consistent strength of our go-to-market strategy, our ongoing momentum in core connectivity and most importantly, our team's unwavering commitment to deliver best-in-class services to consumers and businesses alike.  Amir, that's our presentation. We're now ready for the Q&A. Thank you, Pascal. Operator, we're ready to take the first question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. I think I'll start off with a follow-up here on the outlook that you provided. I appreciate some of the color that Pascal provided about the different operating segments. Maybe at a higher level, could you give us a sense as to what you mean by a more difficult operating environment? In other words, to what extent does the outlook for this year anticipate maybe of a recession or ongoing inflationary pressures? And then I imagine one of the questions we beginning of the day are what are some of the key swing factors? And so if we were to use your adjusted EBITDA guidance as an example, what's the scenario that gets you to 3% growth? And what could be the swing factors that might take that into the or higher category? Brad, let me go ahead, and I'll start and then Pascal can jump in. So first of all, look at the foundation of what we're telling you is we've been -- I think, very conservative and thoughtful in the guidance we pulled together. It is a tough environment to predict. There's a lot of geopolitical things going on that I think anybody would have a hard time seeing and do a crystal ball on, and that's probably the most difficult wildcard that I think we've tried to take a conservative stance of what we see in the economy today and what the foundation that's rested on is. We know that the services that we provide to customers are pretty resilient even during more challenged economic times. And so we have a reasonably high confidence level that our customers are going to continue to want to use the product and pay us for it.  I think if you go back and look at my public comments probably over a year ago, I've had a relatively conservative view of where I thought the economy was going to go. I've been fairly vocal that I think inflation is a tough thing to have a healthy economic environment and that's good for everybody and it creates some challenges in places. And ultimately, a lot of that came to pass. The good news is I think we're through the worst of it, and we see it easy. But as you heard from my comments, we've expected that we're going to continue dealing with some of that pressures we move through this year.  So we don't have an outlook that says that we've solved the problem. We have an outlook that says we're going to continue to deal with the pressures that are hitting some of our line items economically that we've got to account for and things like energy and some of the continued wage and employment pressures that we've had to deal with that will carry through, and we have some longer-term contracts that didn't come up during the last year that we know are going to hit us this year in renewals that we have to factor into that. And I think we've tried to do the best we can around it.  I see the economy being relatively stable right now. We're not seeing anything that's causing us to be extremely concerned about it. But what happens later in the year, who knows. The point we've made is we've kind of assumed that we're not going to be in a robust growth environment as we make our way through the year. And I would tell you if you're asking kind of what the swing factors are, I think the swing factor, frankly, is if there's some kind of a geopolitical disruption that's something significant that none of us anticipated or that we hope would never happen. It creates a disruptive event. That's probably the thing I'd look at and say, I couldn't predict it. I couldn't plan for it, and that's going to be the issue that we have to deal with that just pops up and isn't going to be just an AT&T issue. Yes. Brett, the only other thing I would add is, look, we've assumed in our outlook a more normalized industry growth environment. So to the extent it's more than that or less than that, that could be a swing factor. But the thing that I think is important, and I said this in my commentary is whatever the environment is, we expect to perform relatively well versus the peer set. And our next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups on capital uses. Pascal, you may have said this in your remarks, but what's driving the $2 billion in working capital savings this year? And what are your confidence behind that?  And then could you remind us on the working -- on the CapEx side, obviously, $24 billion again this year. But just what was the longer term sort of view? When can we expect that to start to come down? And what do you guys think of it a more normalized sort of CapEx, especially given what you have now with GigaPower and all the fiber initiatives? Sure thing, John. Here is the way I think about the $2 billion that I flagged in our guidance for 2023. The last several years, we've been growing our subscribers in wireless with that came some upfront acquisition costs. We've said for a while we expect that to level out in 2023. And so once you have that leveling out, we are no longer going to be spending more each and every year than the prior year in acquisitions. So that leveling out, there is assets that are on the books associated with the deferred acquisition costs of those subscribers. That's going to be amortized. We have great visibility into that amortization, and that's obviously noncash because we spent the cash in the prior year. So that we have very good visibility too.  And look, if we grow more than last year in terms of wireless subscribers, that could be a swing factor, but I don't anticipate that. Got it. And then the CapEx? CapEx, the thing to keep in mind is we plan to be at peak levels in '22 and '23 because of the significant contributions that we are getting from DIRECTV. In '22 and '23 CapEx -- is fairly meaningful amounts for spectrum deployment and transformation that will begin to moderate as we exit this year. We haven't updated the guide we provided at Investor Day. But clearly, we expect to trend down towards more normalized capital intensity as we exit this year. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Turning to fiber. GigaPower was a great announcement, but a little smaller than we had expected. John, how do you think about the $1.5 million versus the potential of that venture or for others in that model? And your own on-balance sheet fiber construction of 2 -- I think you said $2 million to $2.5 million annually. It seems like a slower pace than we had been discussing. Is there anything changing there?  And then finally, just to John's question, one quick clarification on the free cash flow. Pascal, is that working capital going to contribute $2 billion to free cash flow in '23? Or is it just offsetting what had been a $2 billion drag, I think, in '22? Phil. So first of all, as I mentioned in my comments, I view the fiber portfolio as that, a portfolio. It's a portfolio of options for us to look at where the return characteristics are most optimal and how we deploy capital around that. And I'm trying to be pretty overt in my commentary to all of you that we understand that we need to be very disciplined in demonstrating to all of you that each of those portfolio decisions and how we put capital against that is, in fact, driving acceptable returns.  I'm very mindful of the fact that the GigaPower announcement is a model that the investor base is unfamiliar with. This is something different and something new. And I want to be very sensitive to the fact, just like we did when we were deploying in Region Fiber and stepping up our investments. I've tried to be transparent with all of you around what our progress has been on the key drivers of the economic return of that investment. We've been sharing pretty aggressively things with you like ARPUs and penetration rates and a variety of other things that give you the confidence that in fact, that's a sustainable, smart long-term investment.  This new GigaPower model is a bit different. And I think it would be normal for any of you to look at it and [indiscernible], it's going to return at the same level. And so to demonstrate to you that I'm serious about ensuring that every incremental investment decision we make in this look, 1.5 million homes, you may say, well, that's not a lot. It's over $1 billion of investment to be able to go do this. We set up this first tranche to be able to come back to you over the course of 18 months and give you information that raises your confidence and in fact, we are driving the returns on this in the way that we anticipate them to be attractive.  And the management team that has been put in place and how the partnership is set up is intended to do exactly that. We will be in the market very, very soon right after the announcement. I intend to have 12 months of penetration information that I can bring back to you. And you can bet that when we're successful doing this and we demonstrate to you that we have the numbers to back it up that it won't necessarily still be $1.5 million. I would also tell you, I want to be thoughtful about, as I've made the comment what is it that we should own and operate 100% to ourselves and what we want to do within the partnership, just like we might have done when we were building wireless infrastructure a couple of decades ago.  And if we hit the ball out of the park and things are great, we may choose to do some of this in-house and on our own and not necessarily subjected to a partnership. On the other hand, if we need more scale and we need to move faster, we have a vehicle now that's set up that we can move very quickly to increase the amount of funding and the amount of capacity that's in that entity to take advantage of that. And so we're going to have data that we can come back to you with, and we'll, I think, do the right thing and try to make sure that you're moving along with us every step of the way. And I just see this as another tool that gives me a lot of flexibility and a lot of options. Relative to the in-region fiber side of things. As I said, I'm looking for a portfolio of returns. And what I tried to stress in my opening remarks is I'm giving you a characterization right now of what we think are high-return options within the 30 million passings that we committed to and what that looks like, and I've tried to clarify because I know some of you have been trying to do the math on it.  But we have these other options now and want to balance out what I think the return characteristics will be through the GigaPower initiative and we are going to now see some volume and capacity coming in out of region -- or excuse me -- out of the $30 million build that will be subject to BEAD funding. And some of that subsidy may have a very different return characteristics than some of the stuff we're doing organically in region right now. And I want to have options open to understand that and look at that aspect of the portfolio as well. And I think we'll get clarity on that as we're end of the third quarter of this year that we start to see where we're successful in bidding for that money, how much it is, what kind of a build line do we put on the business in terms of having to add capacity to get the build accomplished and how does it fit into the kind of operating territories that we think set us up for a geography and a footprint that's intelligent for us to operate moving forward. So that's kind of how I think about it in aggregate, and I'll let Pascal pick up your question on the free cash flow clarification. Hey, Phil, the simple way I think about the majority of the $2 billion is this. We have deferred acquisition cost that's on the books where the cash went out in prior years. That amortization -- it's going to continue to be amortized against EBITDA in 2023. That is noncash expenses burdening. So when you -- just the sheer mechanics of adding that back to our free -- to our EBITDA will elevate the cash EBITDA that the business produces. John, if I can follow up on one start to be 2 split. Do you look at GigaPower and BEAD spending as alternative places to spend your capital and effectively now slowing the organic pace to get to that $30 million? I've given you the pace of how we get to the $30 million. And so I don't see that changing. I think we're committed to what I just articulated to you. So if you're asking am I going to see -- am I going to come back and give you an incremental revision of that $30 million to substitute? No. But to be clear, Phil, this -- the BEAD money and the GigaPower are incremental to the $30 million. Yes, if that's your question, that's 100%. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Great. If I could just stay on the broadband theme, if I could. Perhaps I think you talked perhaps about providing extra color on the financial construct of the BlackRock JV? Are you contributing any capital? Any assets how exactly should we expect that to flow through the financials? And John, on the BEAD, perhaps you just give us a reflection on the status of the process, the timing, how this is going to play out. I think there's been a lot of concerns about delays, the mapping process, the challenges and also some of the state broadband offices maybe not being ready to stand this up. So how do you see this evolving? And when do you think you can actually get shovels in the ground to get know what funding been awarded?  And then just finally, getting to 30 million locations is great. What about the prebuilding with fiber -- with fixed wireless in some of those locations. I think you've talked about that. And how does fixed wireless play into some of that other 30 million plus locations that won't be getting fiber in the near term? Sure. So Simon, I'll be -- I've got to be careful about how much the partnership. It's a partnership structure, it's an entirely separate partnership structure, so you shouldn't expect to see any of the financials pull-through. On a balance sheet structure for us, you should expect it to come in as investment income. We'll give you characterizations of the success of that and as it carries forward and you should think about this as both partners carrying equal weight in the execution of the entity. I think that probably gives you a good enough sense of how it carries through, and if you have something else you want to push on, I can try to give you a little more color.  The BEAD timing, my point of view is I think there is -- there's been enough information put out there right now. We're going to go through a clarification cycle on the first set of data. I think that's moving along at a reasonably good cliff right now. And I think, frankly, the bigger states, those that have a more robust staffing capability are being pretty prompt and aggressive in working through getting that data set squared away. I would agree with you that there's going to be some states that are maybe a little bit slower than others, but my gut is when you're thinking about kind of the 80-20 rule, the bigger states, they're going to have the bulk of the funding are pretty zoned in on this, and they're moving pretty aggressively to get the process underway.  And while there may be some smaller states that take a little bit longer to get their act together or are waiting to see how models develop in some of the more lead states that have bigger staffs to consider these things and then kind of be fast followers. I don't think that's going to inhibit some of the more aggressive states and being in the process and us being in a situation where in the third quarter, there's going to be -- money is starting to flow down from the federal government and being turned back to the states for execution. So I don't think you're going to see any substantial shovels on the ground and certainly, customers being served to any substantial way this year, but I do think you're going to see projects and monies awarded before we exit this year, and you will see those volumes start to come online as we move into periods of 2024, and I expect that those will be concentrated in some of the bigger states that have more robust staff that can move through this fairly quickly.  And pretty much have a view of how they want to go about doing this. They're just trying to get the data to fit into the process. As I've said before, we view fixed wireless as being a tool in the toolbox that we can use to deal with opportunities in areas that are less densely populated. We'll have our next rendition of the product in the market this year. There will be places where we view it as being an acceptable substitute for fiber deployment. They tend to be -- they are going to be less densely populated areas where it makes sense to do that. We have a plan as to how we want to test our assumptions around that. We will deploy and take advantage of that. I think it can have an opportunity to help us on some of the long-standing hybrid fiber copper base that we have that maybe has some speed challenges, and it will probably help us manage some of the churn characteristics associated with that, and I would expect to use it in that case. And then I would also add, look, there's a lot of businesses that maybe aren't in those less densely populated areas where this will be a perfectly acceptable and strong product, given the nature of how their business runs and what they need for their daily data needs and service needs. And so I do expect that we're going to have an opportunity to complement some of our strength in wireless distribution into the business market to provide a more robust fixed broadband alternative, fixed wireless broadband alternative to those customers in bundle and package it in where it makes sense. Simon, one other point on the capital structure for the JV to consider is that we do expect it to carry a meaningful amount of debt funding as well. Okay. Great. And are you contributing anything to it? Any capital any assets? We did. We have contributed some into the partnership. The reason you're going to see it get off the ground as quickly as it will and bring its first customers on in a relatively short orders because while we have been structuring and negotiating this, we've been doing a fair amount of work in parallel quietly. And so the partnership, as we've indicated, is already structured with the management team that's in place that has been doing a lot of work on the offer that knows the markets we're going to be in that has infrastructure and system setup that they can be ready to go on. And I think this is probably one of the things our partner found attractive about this. It's a first-class management team with a lot of capabilities behind it, and we will take some credit for the contribution of that work that we've done within the scope of this year. And our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. I guess first, I just wanted to go back to the notion of wireless postpaid phone market \"normalizing\". I think a lot of people look at the relatively high correlation between the substantial step-up that we've had in the industry to roughly 9 million postpaid phone nets a year for the last couple of years and AT&T's kind of resuscitated growth, as John pointed out, over the last 10 quarters. And as such, when people consider the industry \"normalizing,\" there's a pension out there, I think, to disproportionately assume that whatever amount of tide comes out on industry growth will be disproportionately allocated to AT&T because it disproportionately benefited over the last couple of years.  I was wondering if you could kind of talk about that and whether you think that's realistic and that informs some of your working capital benefits that inform the cash flow or whether you think that, that's wrong and that you can kind of -- if there is a tide that goes out, it's more pro rata across the industry? That's number one.  And then number two, John, you touched on something in the prepared remarks that we haven't talked about a lot here in the U.S., largely because we haven't been moving in this direction until you guys really started this fiber initiative, which is copper decommissioning. And for instance, in markets like Canada, it's a huge topic where they've widely overbuilt their copper plant and we're talking about timing and magnitude of the benefits that you start to get there. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit? Is it a little too early to start really talking about this as a tailwind in something like '24 or is it really with us? Sure, Dave. I don't agree with your thesis at its point. I absolutely 100% dismiss your thesis. And I don't think that's how the market is structured and functioning today by any stretch of the imagination. I think our -- I go back and I look at our performance over the last 2.5 years. First of all, I would tell you, I think the industry is a lot more healthy than many who would like to trying to come up with this narrative? Is competition up? Or is it destroying itself? I mean I see a pretty consistently competitive industry over this period of time. And I tend to look at it not just on the customer counts, but I look at things like both wholesale and retail revenues and how that's flowing through to service revenues. And I see a relatively balanced dynamic in the industry, but the math would tell you that balance dynamic would suggest we've been picking up a bit of no share when it's all said and done.  And I don't think that's a benefit of the number moving from whatever you assume the normal stasis is $7.5 million to $9 million. In fact, I would say of customers that are paying a reasonable monthly bill, we've taken more than our fair share, and I'm more interested in taking revenue share and profitability share than I am necessarily just taking a subscriber share. And I think our numbers would suggest that we've seen an ever improving trend over the 2.5 years in our ability to do that. So I don't submit to your point of view that if the industry \"normalizes\" we revert back to kind of where we were 3 years ago. I think where we are is because of how we're performing today, not what was going on 3 years ago, and that's kind of how I think about it. What I would tell you, Dave, is I don't think there's a windfall that comes in on restructuring of legacy costs. And I've I think I've been on this theme for a little while. I mean we've been working this issue pretty aggressively since the day I came into the job, and I would say we had to start formulating the plans when I came in, but now we have a very robust and functioning organization that we're doing this kind of day in and day out. And I spend more time talking about investing in the new business and the growth that we can get on sustainable fiber and a 5G infrastructure than I do on talking about what we are taking out of service, but we are taking stuff out of service.  And so when we start managing things like our energy costs down, it's because we're decommissioning equipment and taking it off the copper grid when we are able to manage our dispatches down and show you improvements in our operating dynamics on dispatches. It's because we have a smaller footprint to manage. We are doing this day in and day out. And our pace at which we're doing it is accelerating. We've -- I've given you some hints along the way about the number of products that we've shuttered and when we shuttered those products, it starts to take operating costs out of the business. This is part of what we have in our forecast to you to continue to improve our operating costs. So you're seeing this operating leverage start to come into the business, and it's partly contributed to the fact that we're managing through these legacy costs. And as we give you the forecast for cash this year, when we talk about improvements in our overall cost structure, some of it is coming on the backs of what we're doing here.  And I'm very well aware of where our cost structure is on a comparative basis to others that we compete with in the industry, some of which do not have the hybrid asset structure that we have of both fixed and mobile. And we are on this mission to ensure that we're not operating any of that at a disadvantage over the next 3, 4 and 5 years. And I think you're going to just see this ratably come in over that period of time as we work through what is -- it's frankly a bit of a painstaking process to go through. It's central office by central office, line-by-line, customer by customer, but it needs to be done. I think it can be done in a way that makes us a better and healthier business where we have a great hybrid of a fabulous fiber footprint with a fabulous wireless network that is ultimately the future of how customers are going to buy together, and I like that.  I think that hard work will be rewarded in that regard, but I will fully admit, we are creating new intellectual property here around how you get to this space. And I'm choosing to do it organically internally, not through a front-end private equity transaction that puts a little bit of cash from my pocket but ultimately has the value of it accrue to somebody else over the hard work of 3, 4 and 5 years. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with SVB Moffett Nathanson. I want to stay, if I could, with this topic of your portfolio of broadband, John, if I think about your kind of overall mobility national footprint, it sort of maps with today roughly call it, 16%, 17% of the country already overbuilt with fiber, another 10% or 12% to be overbuilt with fiber. Can you just talk about how you think about the consumer value proposition in those different segments where you have wireless that doesn't have a fiber component where it does? And then -- and what role fixed wireless might play to sort of round out that consumer value proposition. Yes. The way I think about it, Craig, is -- and I tried to use this reference earlier is, I think it's a bit of a -- I don't want to use the term [ LAN ] rush, because it's not that easy to put fiber and it takes a little bit longer than a [ LAN ] rush, but we are definitely in a window right now where I do believe a good portion of the United States will ultimately have a fiber connection to it. And I believe there will be -- if you think about this over the long haul that we're moving to an industry, and I've been pretty clear about this, it ultimately, customers are going to want to buy connectivity from one place. They don't necessarily love making a distinction between their fixed provider and their mobile provider.  And I think over time, we're going to see an ordering of industry assets that leans more toward that. And my point of view to be in a strong position as you -- if you have the best technology out there and you ultimately build the largest footprint fastest, you're going to be in a better position to ultimately play in the outcome of how that restructuring gets done, and you're going to have the strongest customer base on a relative basis and owning and operating those assets and having the ability to control the product offering and control the cost on it will be the best way to control your progress going forward.  So yes, it's a deliberate process to continue to build fiber infrastructure and ultimately overlay it with the wireless business, but that's a process that I think is incredibly durable and sustainable. And my job is to make sure I'm doing it faster and better than anybody else and I think it'll come out in an okay place as a result of that. And as I said, my job is to ensure that people who give us money to go and allow for us to make that investment feel that on a marginal basis, on an incremental basis, we're doing that in a way that's driving successful returns.  I think fixed wireless, as I said, has its place in the portfolio. I don't see it's place long term in dense metropolitan areas, and I don't see it in reasonably well populated suburban areas. I don't see the dynamic of that product, and I've been pretty clear about this, if I start to think about consumer behavior and demand of consumption. And I start to take those curves out over 3 years. I don't see that as the optimal way to service a customer in the near term. So I think the mobile network's role in life is to ensure that whenever somebody is away from a fixed location, they can still get the same kind of capabilities that they get while they're at home, but there's only a certain amount of bandwidth that a mobile network will ever be able to foster and support in that regard.  Mobile bits are going to be higher-value bits. They're going to need to be engineered differently. They should sell at a premium because of the supply and demand dynamics on it. And I want to ensure that my mobile network is, in fact, delivering that premium solution on those mobile bits when they need to be provided. And it's absolutely 100% there to do that. And I think at the end of the day, if your mobile network is doing that mad fashion, then you're going to have an opportunity to work in the high-value mobile space for what are going to be emerging capabilities that people need to facilitate the true promise of 5G and real-time transmission ubiquitously any place anywhere. And that last question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Just thinking a little bit more about the wireless growth opportunity. Can you share with us how AT&T is doing with the appearing of customers onto unlimited and premium unlimited plans? And then given some of the comments on inflation, are there opportunities for AT&T to update wireless and fiber pricing again this year? And are any of those opportunities included in the guidance? Mike, so I'm not going to -- look, it's just not good hygiene to talk about what our plans are on pricing, and I don't intend to do that today. I would just maybe point you back to -- we have a management team who is very good at understanding where we have great value to our customer and where we're selling in that market. And are we getting the maximum value and value exchange back from the customer. And that's across all of our products and services.  Last year, I mean, you can see we saw an area where we felt like -- we had some customers that weren't taking advantage of the best plans that we had to offer with the most recent features, and we decided to work in our customer base to help them understand that there were better places they could go where there was maybe an exchange for them to pay us a little bit more, but to get a lot more for what they were paying us. I think we executed that incredibly well. We just gave you churn numbers that were incredibly strong churn numbers, all while we did that, and I think you should step back from that and say that's pretty good execution. I'm not sitting here telling you about I grew service revenues and I'm dealing with a customer flight problem. I dealt with lower churn. And I think that's a testament to the fact that we were able to get a win-win proposition on our customer base with the customers walked away feeling better about the circumstances, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities.  Anywhere in our portfolio on any product where we think we can do those types of things, that's just part of being good management. I would expect that there's always opportunities for us to look into that -- where I think we are on our ability to walk people up the value continuum. We still have room. We're not -- we're not through the 5G replacement cycle. As you know, when a customer comes in and chooses to do that upgrade, that's a great opportunity for us to talk to them about what product and services that they have and to help them understand that maybe buying a more robust plan or fine-tuning how they're buying plans from us might fit into their portfolio and give them the best value.  And we do expect we're going to continue to make headway on that. That's part of that service revenue growth the past call guided due to. I don't think anything that we've got in there is Herculean. We've been talking about this for the better part of 3 years with you. Every year, we've managed to do what we said we were going to do, and it's been consistent with the service revenue numbers that we forecasted for you. I think you should also understand that the global economy is not completely recovered from the pandemic. We still expect that as travel continues to normalize itself that we're going to see a little bit of uptick in relief coming from the likes of more global visitors coming in on roaming and people going places.  I think Asia is still going to be suppressed for a period of time, but let's hope the back end of recent policy changes that have occurred in Asia means that we will eventually hit a normalization there that will ultimately get us back to kind of pre-pandemic norms at some point, which is it's good to be going down that path as opposed to having a major footprint that is kind of trying to create a fortress and not allow people to move back and forth between their borders. So we started at the beginning of the end there, which is good.  So I don't feel any concern around whether or not we can effectively move people up that continuum. We still have room to grow we're banking on that in our guidance and we'll execute around it just as we have any other years. I don't know if you want to add anything there, Pascal. No, I think that's all well said. So again, I appreciate your time this morning. I'm really pleased with the year. I thought it was a strong consistent execution year. I'm just equally as pleased that we've done the right things to set us up for continued growth as we move through '23. I hope you feel the same. I know the management team is very focused on delivering what we shared with you this morning is our expectations. I feel really good about where our customer base is. As I mentioned just a few moments ago, to have churn levels in our wireless business running at the position they're in with the competitive intensity that is occurring in the industry to have the position we have with our broadband base on fiber and the customer satisfaction is coming with it, I think, bodes incredibly well even in an uncertain environment as we're moving forward. And the good news is, I think we can grow in both those places to continue to drive the kind of tempered indirect growth that we shared with you.  So we're looking forward to doing it again next year. I think we've got the right opportunities in place. I think there's a lot more that we know we can still do to run this business better, and we're about doing that to ensure that we deliver improved performance for you moving forward.  So thank you very much. I hope you all have a great '23. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect."

         "Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead. Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release.  Furthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun. Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Last time we were together was the second of November, where we had a chance for the first time, at least in my 3-year tenure to talk about guidance and expectations for the years ahead. The good news is we had a very solid fourth quarter, a quarter that, in my view, puts us in good stead to step forward and meet the guidance that we have delivered to all of you.  Not only have we taken big steps to reduce the risks that, of course, we've faced over the last 3 years but importantly, we're well on our way to restoring the operational and financial strength that we got used to prior to our MAX moment. Challenges remain, we have a lot to do, but overall, we're feeling pretty good about the way we closed '22 and we're well positioned for '23 and beyond.  Our key metric, as everybody knows, is free cash flow. Importantly, we were able to generate more than $3 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter driven by the progress in our performance and importantly, continued strong demand. And this helped us generate positive full year cash flow for the first time since 2018, a very important turnaround metric for us.  Several key milestones and events that I'd like to highlight. Let's start with the BCA deliveries, which I know everyone tracks. '22 total was 480 with 69 deliveries in December. Notably, the 737 deliveries, we had 387 and exceeded our target of 375 and it included 31 787s as we unwound inventory and delivered from the production line following the important return to delivery over the course of the summer.  On the order front, and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787 highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That's the most since 2018.   More broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It's safe and it's the most reliable of the airplane fleets.  Production, we've all gone from 0 to 31 a month and we're prioritizing stability, which we have not yet achieved, but we're on a steady course to do so. And orders, more than 1,500 gross orders to date. 737 MAX returning to service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business.  This month, of course, we all know that, that occurred. We have more airplanes on the tarmac in China to bring back into service just as we did here in the U.S. before we began any deliveries of any sort. And I'm not going to guess going forward, when deliveries may or may not start, as everyone knows in our guidance, we have derisked for that possibility.  737 MAX 7 and 10, everybody knows, we got our extension approved and attached to legislation at the end of the year. That was a very important moment. I'll remind everyone that, that doesn't mean that these were certified. It simply means that the FAA and Boeing can follow the existing application and do that job and do it the right way. So we feel very, very good about having derisked that moment as well. I will also want to point out, every argument we made on behalf of that extension related to safety. The premise for our chosen course and the application that we filed with safety first and it will always be safety first.  Following defense. Our SLS launch, this was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team broadly. The Artemis I launch in November, which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring. And I'd like to congratulate the NASA team broadly for the succession of the Starliner mission.  It's an incredible success, incredible, and it went beautifully and almost flawlessly every step of the way. So again, a significant accomplishment for space travel in general. But that rocket, again, just shows what Boeing is capable of when we put our minds to it, we follow our disciplines, we stay patient and ultimately prove to the world that there's more to do in space. Following Global Services, another terrific story, it is simply following the recovery of our industry in general and everywhere in the world. So we had a great quarter pretty much across the board. We continue to grow. We continue to invest so that we are prepared to support our customers as they bring their airlines back to where they were before COVID. So we'll reaffirm our guidance.  And with this progress, which we feel good about both the financial and the operational outlook that we shared with you in November, and that includes the cash flow, the delivery ranges that we set for '23 as well as for the 2025 and 2026 time frame.  Our realities are still the same, a difficult, difficult supply chain. And while average deliveries met our objectives, we continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines simply so that we do not travel work as we run into supply chain shortfalls. So those stoppages, while they are coming down are not where they need to be as we think about stable rates going forward.  I will not, in this discussion and/or in Q&A, highlight any 1 supplier within the supply chain. Know that we're working with all of them. There's a significant amount of transparency in those discussions between them, between us and everybody is focused on the rate improvements that we have outlined to all of you. All things considered and reflecting on these last few years, we're feeling pretty good about where we stand heading into this year.   Demand, very strong portfolio, very well positioned. We have faced plenty of tests in a number of orders all around the world with some of our toughest customers, and we know this portfolio is well positioned. We have a robust pipeline of development programs, including broadly across our defense business, and we're innovating new capabilities that prepare us for the next generation of products.  One of the more significant achievements was recently announced by NASA in their Sustainable Flight Demonstrator contract. This is a set of technologies that's intending to cut fuel emissions by up to 30%. Those are the kind of standards that, in our view, are required to ultimately launch a new commercial airplane wrapped in sustainability.  We've derisked major aspects of the business, and our performance is improving. We're embedding lean across our operations to drive productivity ultimately to achieve the kinds of targets that we've set out. We've got work to do, but we're feeling really good about our progress. We're proud of our team, and we're confident in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian West. Great. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next page and cover the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $20 billion. That's up 35% year-over-year, driven by higher commercial volume. Core operating margin was negative 3.3%, and the core loss per share was $1.75. Both the margin and the loss per share were significantly better than prior year and impacted in the quarter by period expenses and abnormal costs.  From a free cash flow perspective, our primary financial metric was positive $3.1 billion for the quarter, up significantly versus the prior year on higher deliveries and strong order activity and up sequentially versus the prior quarter and a bit better than our original estimate. I'll take a minute to go through each of the business units. Moving on to the next page with BCA. BCA revenue in the fourth quarter was $9.2 billion.  That's up 94% year-over-year driven by higher 787 and 737 deliveries, partially offset by 787 customer considerations. On the operating margins, they were negative 6.8% in the quarter, seemingly better than a year ago and in the quarter driven by abnormal costs and higher period expenses, including higher R&D spending.  I'll take a minute to go through a few highlights of the major programs, starting with the 737. We had 110 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 387 for the full year, slightly ahead of our estimate. We ended the year with 250 MAX airplanes in inventory, 30 of which were Dash 7 and Dash 10s, and we had 138 for customers in China.  We do expect the monthly deliveries from inventory to slow slightly as fewer airplanes will be available, combined with some impact from the Dash 7, Dash 10 builds. We still expect most inventoried airplanes will be delivered by the end of 2024. On the 787, we had 22 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 31% for the full year. We ended the year with 100 airplanes in inventory, most of which will be delivered by the end of 2024.  We booked $350 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, taking the total to date to $1.7 billion. We're increasing the abnormal accounting estimate by about $600 million to roughly $2.8 billion in total as we will be under the 5 per month production rate a bit longer than expected due to a supplier constraint that has temporarily slowed production.  We still expect to hit 5 per month this year. Our total year delivery guidance of 70 to 80 is unchanged, and there is no change to the 2023 cash flows. 77 orders were strong in the quarter, and we've added 100 airplanes to the accounting quantity, which increases our GAAP program margin. On the 777X, the program timeline is holding and efforts are ongoing. Abnormal costs were $112 million in the quarter, and there is no change to the $1.5 billion total estimate.  On the customer settlement front, we continue to make good progress resolving contractual issues on the 3 big programs. The 737 MAX is near the finish line with the vast majority of customers settled.  Of the original $9.3 billion that [ were ] set aside, there's only 3% left. On the 787, a year ago, we included a significant provision in the program, which has been very stable. There are far fewer customers in the MAX, and we've already reached agreement with several, all in line with our estimates. On the 777X, there are even fewer customers and discussions are ongoing.   Keep in mind that the revenue and cash impact of these settlements will be over several years and all contemplated in both the near- and long-term financial guidance. Finally, on the orders front for BCA, we booked 376 orders in the quarter and have over 4,500 airplanes in backlog valued at $330 billion.   Moving on to the next page, I'll cover BDS. BDS revenues in the fourth quarter were $6.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Operating margins were 1.8%. And if you include services, defense margins would be 200 basis points higher to 4%. There are 2 things impacting BDS margins in the quarter.   First, we felt the operational impact of supply chain constraints in labor and stability. Second, we saw adverse timing of certain cost accrual true-ups, including higher pension costs that flow through the P&L in the quarter a big focus for the BDS leadership team to improve execution stability both in the factory and in the supply base.  Some additional highlights, as Dave mentioned, we're very proud of Artemis I successful mission to the moon last November, and we delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, including the first P8 to New Zealand as well as 3 satellites, including the first 2 O3B mPower units. We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter. including a contract for 2 KC-46A Tankers from Japan and an award for 12 Chinook helicopters from the Egyptian Air Force. The BDS backlog is at $54 billion.  Moving on to the next page, Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter, primarily driven by our parts and distribution business. BGS revenue was $4.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year and operating margin was 13.9%.  Commercial volume was very strong, partially offset by some softness in the government space. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including an F-15 depot support order for the U.S. Air Force, and we opened up the Germany distribution center. The BGS backlog is $19 billion.  Moving on to the full year, the next page. Full year financial results, revenue came in at $66.6 billion. That's 5% up year-over-year driven by higher commercial volume, offset by lower defense revenue. Core operating margin was negative 7% and the core loss per share was over $11 both a bit worse reflecting the impact of defense charges taken earlier in the year.  And on free cash flow, we generated $2.3 billion positive free cash flow in the year up significantly from the prior year driven by higher deliveries and order activity. Moving on to the next page. I just want to put that $2.3 billion of free cash flow in perspective.  As you can see from the chart on the left, we've made a lot of progress over the last 3 years. 2020 was a usage of $20 billion of cash, 2021 improved but was still a usage of $4 billion of cash, in 2022, $2.3 billion positive. As Dave mentioned, a lot of work that's been done and more work to do.  The team is pretty proud to get back to positive territory. It's been the 737 return to service and the deliveries that are ramping. It's been the 787, it's been restarted. It's been the commercial market recovery that's been a benefit along the way with a very strong order book, reflecting our customers' confidence in our product lineup. And of course, our service business has held up incredibly well. It was a good exit to 2022, and we expect momentum to continue for 2023.  Moving on to the next page, cash and debt. On the cash and marketable securities front, we ended the year with $17.2 billion, up $3 billion versus the third quarter and we had $12 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn.  On the debt side, we finished the year with $57 billion in debt. And as a reminder, our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a top priority. Our liquidity position is strong, and we're very comfortable satisfying near-term maturities, and the overall plan continues to be deliver airplanes, generate cash, pay down debt.  Moving on to the next page, 2023. Our financial outlook for 2023 is unchanged from what we shared in November. Operating cash flow in total will be between $4.5 billion and $6.5 billion. We'll reinvest about $1.5 billion in CapEx for a net free cash flow of $3 billion to $5 billion in 2023.  As we start the year, overall demand remains strong. Global pass-through traffic increased almost 70% in 2022, and we're at 75% of pre-pandemic levels globally. If you take out China, that number grows to over 90%. So demand is pretty robust and reflective of our order book. Our priority continues to be execution stability. And while we still see some disruptions in the factory and the supply chain, we're hard at work with our partners to address these issues and ultimately focused on meeting our customer commitments.  On the segment operating cash flow, same numbers as November, BDS, we expect to be a usage of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion of cash. BGS will generate between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and BCA will generate between $2.5 million and $3.5 billion. On the commercial delivery front, 737 deliveries are unchanged and between 400 and 450 airplanes, 787 deliveries are unchanged between 70 and 80 airplanes, and we've added a couple of items on the expense front.  We expect R&D for 2023 to come in at about $3.2 billion versus $2.9 billion in 2022. The vast majority of this increase will be in BCA. We also have unallocated eliminations in other which will be relatively in line with 2022 at $1.6 billion. One important thing to note is on the quarterly phasing, it will look very similar to last year as both deliveries and the financials will improve throughout the course of the year.  On the first quarter specifically, EPS will be an improvement over 4Q 2022 but remain in a loss position. And cash will still be a usage in the first quarter, although an improvement from the first quarter of 2022. Overall, we're squarely focused on free cash flow. And it's so far so good as we enter 2023.  Moving on to the last page, 2025, 2026 long-term guidance. Same page we showed you in November, $10 billion of free cash flow is still our objective. And it's important to note that margins and EPS are important, but they will be uneven over the next 2 years. As we unwind the BCA inventory, we put the BCA abnormal costs behind us, and we get the BDS margins back on track to its normal trajectory.  We're still confident that this plan is underpinned by things we largely control, one, productivity; two, the commercial rate ramp; three, services growth; and four, the transition of key defense programs from development to production. Overall, we're as confident today as we're back in November, and we feel good about the way 2023 is starting. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for any final comments. Yes. I think, Brian, the numbers speak for themselves. We couldn't be more pleased with the way the year closed with very few surprises. We're heading into the year. We know the supply chain is going to be tough and constrained, but we also believe that we control that environment. It's our job to get ahead of it. So thank you. We're happy to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]   Our first question will be from Peter Arment with Baird. So congrats on the progress in billings in the fourth quarter and the free cash flow generation, and you reiterated, obviously, the long-term free cash flow target of $10 billion mid-decade and the $3 billion to $5 billion in '23. So Brian, I guess, on '23, can you just maybe talk around confidence levels around that expected free cash flow target specifically at BCA and BDS, like kind of what are the key risks to call out, I assume it's supply chain around the guidance ranges.  And then just, Dave, unrelated question, but can you comment broadly on the pickup in MAX flights in China as our checks show 220 revenue flights that are scheduled in February, and there's already 60 flights that have occurred this month. So clearly, there's MAX activity that's picking up in China. Yes, Peter, why don't I start with China. Your numbers are within the range of my numbers, that is what's going on. I think as everybody knows, the opening up of China is going to be a major event in aviation. And the aviation industry was already stressed in terms of demand broadly in the world. So this is a serious bump for everybody, but most importantly, within China, they need the MAX to fly to satisfy those demands.  So we were going to do there what we do here in the U.S. and focus on the airplanes they have on the tarmac today, which is close to 100 airplanes, the readiness of each and every 1 of them, and ultimately, they're getting into full revenue service. So for 6 months, I think that's the course for all of us to stay focused on.  And then we're going to take up the question of deliveries. And is there a moment in time where that begins to come back. I don't want to predict that date, Peter, but the odds go up every day. Our MAX gets back into service and the airplanes that we have on our tarmacs, hopefully, we get ready and deliver to our customers. So I think there's a reason to be optimistic. We will not change guidance and/or predict those outcomes until they actually occur. And Peter, on the cash flow, the 3% to 5%, again, we feel very confident with that range. The key underpinnings will be the deliveries that we talked about, the 37 at the low end assumes that we don't get much better through the course of 2023 than we did this past year, which is low 30s for the whole year. At the high end, it actually says we do low 30s first half and then low 40s in second half.  So I think that all of that is within the mix. As you recall, we had a big December. One caution is that December was kind of over 50% on the MAXs, but October was not quite that high, and that's an indication that we're still not stable, it's still bumpy, but we still feel good about the overall trajectory in terms of being able to hit the $400 million to $450 million. And on the 87 similarly, I feel good about where we landed and then we were headed to hit the 70% to 80%, which underpins pretty much most of the cash flow for BCA, those 2 product lines. And then BDS, no change to what we thought things playing out pretty much as we expected. And next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. When you look at the MAX right now, the good news is you don't have a demand problem. And as you guide to 31 a month production in 2023, and our assumption is that if you had engine delivery is higher, you can move up from there, given that you're facilitized and staffed for 38. And if you look out at the 2025 or 2026 time frame, when you're guiding to 50 a month, you were once at 57 a month. So that would not be new territory. So what I'm trying to get at is when you look at these 2 years, clearly, there are supplier issues in '23, but is it feasible that you could see that production rate go higher? And if so, what would you want to see? And I look at '23 and '25 differently since '25, I'm assuming we'd be out from under a lot of these supplier issues. Yes, Doug, again, I don't want to conjecture too much, but the 2 essential things to achieve that kind of objective. Number one, are we facilitized at that kind of rate? And the answer is, as we progress through this year, we'll be yes. Number two, and by far, the more challenging is are we going to be stable, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, predictable where the supply chain and the buffers that we put in place with respect to that supply chain are adequate.  That's a harder, tougher put. I think it's going to take us all year to ultimately demonstrate that stability can and will be achieved. And if I get to that, and I hope I do, we do, then I'll take on that conjecture. But I -- for right now, we are just squarely focused on that question of stability. As Brian said, our fourth quarter was good.  We finished well. We didn't have a lot of surprises in December. But if you look at the month-to-month in the quarter, you can't be happy with that. I mean just a few too many stoppages along the way. As you know, our philosophy is we're not going to travel anything anymore. We're not going to compound issues that occur. And we're going to maintain that philosophy. So watch the month-to-month, that's going to tell you a lot about our willingness to consider the rates you're talking about. And is that true? And when you look out to the '25, '26 time frame, obviously, there's a long way to go before we get there. How do you think about just flexibility given there may be a number of scenarios that could come out here in terms of production levels? Well, as I said, will we be facilitized to handle that kind of volume at that stage? Yes, we'll stay well ahead of that. And you'll see things that occur over this year that will demonstrate that. So I'm -- that's the part of it. I'm not so worried about. Again, it's stability questions. And then there will be a factor that we'll have to apply with respect to China. We're going to have to believe we're back and we're back for good. Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask about supply chain. Can you -- I heard you, Dave, that you're not going to mention any specific supplier and I hear that and respect that. But if you could provide any more detail on what's happening on the 787?  Is there a new quality control escape? Or is it just pure timing delays, visibility into that getting better? Any incremental detail there would be really helpful. And then what's the latest from the engine OEMs? I sounded a little better yesterday, but what are you guys hearing? Let me start with the latter of the engine discussion. Again, what I'm really happy with is the transparency with which we are planning for rates with our engine suppliers and you know who they are and predominantly one. And I'm feeling good about that. And we have plans to do it. I don't think any of us are yet at the high confidence moment on that, but we will. And that progression will occur over the course of the year when we are at high confidence, then we're going to get to the kind of rates that we -- that are built into our guidance.  We've got a low end and a higher end and we'll find out where we're going to fit on that depending on it. But the transparency is amazing, no one's out guessing each other. And because this market has been so strong, no one is second guessing the rates. Everybody knows these rates, if we get to them, we'll achieve them and then we can continue to move forward. So there's a lot of good, but until we see it month to month and until we get to that high confidence moment, we're going to hold our production rate steady. And Brian, you're up to date on the 87 discussion. Yes. So on the 87, so the fourth quarter was our first real full quarter in a while of being able to deliver airplanes, both still at a low rate and also from inventory it feels pretty good. And as we go into 2023, remember, the scope of work is pretty clear what we have to do in terms of reworking the inventoried airplanes. But remember, our suppliers have a part of that responsibility in their scope.  So bringing the suppliers, the big suppliers along to make sure that they are conforming and they've got all the protocols in place to get that done on their end is something that we're working our way through. It's going to take us a little bit longer than originally expected, which is why we are going to shift out, going to 5 per month a bit later in the year but we still see 70 to 80 in the cards, and so far so good.  What you'll likely see is some good liquidation of the inventory as we go through the year and then obviously ramp up the factory as we get deeper into the year. But net-net, the [ 70 to 80 ] we still feel good about. Next question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One, Brian, I think you mentioned $600 million higher abnormal cost on the 787. Is that cash? Is that absorbed now in unchanged free cash flow guidance? And then also for defense, if you can just touch on your margin profitability expectation and rough magnitude for 2023? Sure. So in terms of the first question, we -- the 787 abnormal, there is no cash impact. Part of that is just because part of that is just fixed cost absorption, but there's no change in the cash outlook. It's not significant in that regard. So we're holding. On the defense margins. So in the quarter, as I mentioned, we had some bump around from the supply chain constraints and some of the labor, not just in the fourth quarter, as well as some of the timing of accruals that I mentioned.  As we move our way into 2023, we clearly expect those margins to get better. It's not going to be all the way back to what normal might look like, but it's going to be improved sequentially. And we feel pretty good about the lineup in terms of the product portfolio. And as we remind you is that the products are performing incredibly well with the customers. So we feel good about the underlying base is the BDS margins will get better, and we're positioned for that as we head into the year. Next, we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Dave, you mentioned the milestone order from United despite the macroeconomic uncertainty in the near and medium term. So when you look at COVID-19 now approaching the rearview mirror, China reopening, I mean the demand for air travel has been pretty strong. Can you talk about what your customers are saying about potential new aircraft orders? Should we anticipate more airlines making landmark orders like United? And could we see BCA at a positive book-to-bill for the year? Yes. I -- again, I always hesitate to forecast specific orders. I will say that we're involved in more big orders now than we've been in a long time. I think last year was a big indicator for folks that big orders are out there. I think the United One is, in fact, indicative. But Delta earlier, there's just -- there are some big interest in aviation, I'd say, the majority now outside the U.S. as opposed to inside the U.S. And we're considering some big -- some really big things. And we're in the midst of all of those.  So yes, I have a -- I'm pretty optimistic. I'm not going to forecast numbers because that's never healthy. But I do think over the next couple of quarters, you'll see some big decisions made to both manufacturers, and you'll see some new entrants into the aviation world that aim to make a real difference, and again, largely in the global markets. If I could do a follow-up, with that environment that you described, it sounds pretty robust. Can you describe the pricing environment for these orders and how they compared to pre-COVID levels? Yes. Well, when you're in the midst of any one deal, it feels ruthless. But if you really do balance it out, and I guess I credit both manufacturers, it's been pretty disciplined through this whole COVID moment. And so you see very few reaches and sort of crazy things that are out of the norm. And now we're in sort of that supply chain constrained world where people simply want to get positions so that they know they have airplanes when the time comes.  Recessions don't seem to get in the way because remember, we're competing for deliveries out 4 and 5 years from now. So they're not really computing recession into that. So anyway, again, I feel good, and I also -- I'm going to guess that -- because it's always a guess that pricing will stay disciplined. And next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Okay. And really, I guess, just a little bit of a quick clarification this morning rather than a question. Just making sure to understand the difference between production and deliveries this year on 737. When you say the high end of the guidance is assuming low 30s and moving to high 40s you're talking deliveries there.  And then with regard to production, when you say that you are kind of hoping to get to a place where you see some stability this year, that's with regard to production in the factory. And so that would make it very -- make it seem unlikely that the production rate is going higher than 31 this year. Is that a fair way to think about things regardless of where that deliveries shake out? You're right on characterizing the delivery framework. And I would say that as we move through the course of the year and we'll have fewer inventoried airplanes, that will put a little bit more opportunity on units come out of the factory. So production rate at the right moment could get higher. We'll wait and see. We're just going to stick to the range for now. And as a reminder that we're not shooting for the low end of the range. Right, right. And as far as that stability that you're looking for, how much at this point would you say needs to come from improvement in the supply chain versus any improvement that's necessary in the internal productivity? Yes. Look, I don't want to suggest that we don't have our own opportunities internally. We do, mostly driving cycle out and creating buffers in the right positions, et cetera, all things that you would attached to a company that really practices lean. So we will make improvements there.  But the lion's share of the rate discussions is going to be built around the supply chain and the capacity, literally the capacity and capability of that supply chain to meet the new rates. And as I said, very transparent discussions. It's almost entirely built around labor availability, trained labor ability as we move through the course of the year. Hiring is not a constraint anymore. People are able to hire the people they need. It's all about the training and ultimately getting them getting them ready to do the sophisticated work that we demand. And next, we go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Yes. Could you update us on your efforts to certify the MAX 7 and 10 as well as the 777X? And as part of that, the agreement to allow you to push out the certification date of the 7 and the 10, I think you agreed to backfit some software changes on the existing MAX fleet. Could you tell us how much that's likely to cost? When did you take the accounting impact. I'll take the last part of that to get that off the table. The provision to retrofit the fleet was taken in the fourth quarter. That's behind us. It was small.  And there's a reason why it's small. But I just -- I hope everybody knows and understands how important it was to get those extensions in place in the legislation. The argument was purely a safety argument. Fortunately, we got a lot of support on both sides of the aisle, and we got it done. So this gives us all the flexibility we need to get these airplanes certified under the existing applications and we feel good about that. We think first flights for the 7 will be this year and probably for the 10 next year. So we like where that stands. Everybody's calm, the FAA, nobody ever put pencils down. So we're just going to progress. And like always, we're not going to tell you exact dates as to when we expect those certifications.  So all feels good. And then yes, the legislation that was approved included some improvements that we put into our cockpit on the DASH 10 that everybody agrees are useful and helpful to pilots. And those largely software adjustments will be incorporated into the entire MAX fleet over several years. As Brian said, it's not a large number, but we provided for it, and we're confident we can meet those objectives provided the cert and those improvements are accomplished here in the next year or 2. And the 777X? No, I'm sorry. Everything is on course for the 777X. And I think the only issue that has created some concern over the last couple of years has been our agreement with EASA and some of the design principles that we think we're making terrific progress with EASA. And I think we will have a coordinated regulatory approach to the cert, and so we're staying on our targets. And next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays. Could you touch on the large pickup in 787 deferred the balance in the quarter, what that means going forward for the cash outlook on the 87? And also, Brian, if you could just touch on the big pickup that we saw in the BCA unit loss, is that just related to the higher 787 deliveries in the quarter? Yes. On the deferred production balance, that's basically the 787 cost base extension that I mentioned has an impact on program margins, and that's amplified by all the finished goods inventory that's sitting there on the under airplanes. So that's driving the increase. And your last question, basically, it's impacted by customer mix and the impact of customer concessions and considerations. Okay. And a quick follow-up on the -- I think you said 138 China airplanes in inventory. Are you still looking to remarket those? Yes, but only partially. And as of now, when you see the sort of the results of that effort, you can assume that will be on pause with respect to that until we get -- until we understand completely where China wants to go. So the answer is yes, and you'll see progress but you'll also see a pause so that we can discern what China wants to do. And hopefully, that's good news. Our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi. Brian, just a quick clarification question and then one over on the services business. And a clarification, you mentioned that margins at BDS tick up in '23, but don't get back to the long-term margin rates that you expect are on a normalized basis. Just curious what the milestones are going to be for us to be watching out for on getting back to those normalized rates? And then on the services business. Maybe just a little bit more color on expectations for '23 with regard to your expectations on growth rate and margins? Yes, sure. On the BDS. So as you mentioned, long term, high single digits is what we've talked about. But in the near term, the same kind of supply chain constraints and labor availability that we've talked about in the BCA world, impact the BDS role as well. So when the current environment is less constrained and stabilizes, that will be a benefit.  We expect it to happen partly in 2023, but the key thing to watch is just the stability of the supply chain is going to be a big, big deal that we're keeping our eye on. And that's going to be important as margins will tend to accelerate. The time and the pace remains to be seen, but it will get better in 2023.  On the services side, so we had a big year for the services business. It's going to have to -- and part of that was based on the commercial recovery, and we enjoyed the benefit of that in 2022. But BGS, in terms of their revenue, they finished the quarter at a pretty good spot, pretty clean basis.  And if you just kind of think about that as how you would extrapolate into 2023 by quarter gives you a pretty good view of where we see that growth coming for. So it will grow, margin will be just fine right within that mid-teen levels that we've enjoyed. So we feel pretty good about the prospects of the service business, very stable, continue to grow, no surprises. Next, we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Just circling back on thinking about product development and so on and so forth. Like you mentioned at the Investor Day that Boeing wouldn't be going forward with a middle of the market product probably until sometime in the 2030s. How should we think about that in light of the recent win with NASA on the -- that you truss-braced -- the truss-braced transonic wing program and what that means? Could that be some early technology on a new platform? Or what are you looking for to happen in the technology world to feel confident about doing something new? Yes. So Ron, I'm going to highlight 3 things that I think are going to contribute to a truly differentiated new product. One of them is the truss wing, so I'll refer to that now. As you know, that is technology that's been worked on for the better part of a decade alongside of NASA. And the program that we've embarked on here is how do you commercialize it? How do we put it through the right set of tests, et cetera, so that, in fact, can be incorporated into new airplanes.  So there's real intent there to be able to do it. I'm not sure it is going to be as good and/or applicable for middle of the market and/or a wide-body, but it will definitely have a role to play someday in the narrow-body world. So that's number one. Number two, you've heard us talk about the digital thread being able to create the digital model, not just for the airplane, but for the factory and for the servicing.  But we are really cutting our teeth on a couple of defense programs that, frankly, we're learning a lot every day, all day, so that whatever we do on that next commercial airplane will incorporate the digital thread. And it will be way more mature than what it's been so far in our discrete defense programs.  So anyway, I feel very good about that. And then the last major element has been the one that usually carried the day, but in this case, I think will simply contribute to a better day and that's propulsion technologies, bigger bypass ratios, and you probably know a truss-wing setup will create that opportunity to a far greater extent than today's wing simply because of the distance from the ground.  So there are lots of reasons why I think these technologies can and will be proven and ultimately adapted. And when you're considering a 50-year kind of program for any new airplane, you have to think about this. And in our view, the objective has to be somewhere between 25% and 30% better than it is today. And that's what we're focused on. And I think we have the time to do it and the technologies to play out. Got it. And if I can, just a quick detailed follow-on. What are you thinking about headcount productions as we go -- or headcount projections as we go into '23? I mean how has it been in the labor market kind of across the supply chain, which you hear is everybody needs more people. And how has it been for Boeing? And what are you doing to try to cross that bridge? Yes. Ron, I want to be clear. We have had no trouble hiring people, none. We're sort of at/or a little above where we were in the days you guys all remember because we've got so many of these rework apparatuses going on, and there are a lot of people required to do it. So our job is to actually just take what we have, incorporate all the learning from the folks who are doing the rework that will displace whatever retirements and/or demographic issues that we have over the next couple of years.  We have a pretty good setup on labor and a pretty good mechanism ironically with these return to service aircraft and the joint verification, a pretty good mechanism to train mechanics, train our people to do the job. And on the engineering front, man, we've had a real good run hiring is over 10,000. Our job is to make sure that we just train them right, get them involved early and get on the life.  So we are not facing a big demand. Our supply chain probably still is working the hiring a bit, but it's nowhere near as important as their -- the training of the people that they're bringing in. I've seen this thing really ease up in the last year, like really ease up. Tier 1s, I doubt any of them are really fighting for talent anymore. And underneath that, I think the supply chains are filling out. It's all about now that training and development. And next, we'll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. So you're not going to be surprised. I'd like to ask you about defense. I wanted to know, first, could you broadly discuss your defense portfolio, the opportunity set and what we should be focusing on? Just by example, I noticed that AIAA you were discussing a C-17 C-130 recap. Second to that, could you also discuss the F-15EX program in terms of expectations for deliveries, production rates? And also if margins on the program might be comparable to what we saw when you were selling older models under FMS. Yes. So let me take this one. Let me address it at the portfolio level. In light of the difficulties we've had with the fixed-price development contracts, which I consider more of a contracting exposure as opposed to a portfolio exposure, I feel really good about the portfolio broadly, and there are reasons why I feel that way.  We're fully invested, as you know, autonomy. I believe autonomy and teaming are going to be one of the real drivers with respect to airplane development, Air Force, Navy requirements going forward. And we're already invested and we're making real progress with both of those members of the fighting forces. And I'm sure you know the programs that we talk about.  And there are others we can't talk about, which we're as excited, if not more excited about. So the long portfolio and the development that we've sustained over all these years, I feel really good about. We have the T-7 trainer. It's way more important than just the market for trainers itself.  Ultimately, we think it's -- it can be used as a derivative to do other things for the Air Force, and I'm sure you know what that's about. But maybe even more importantly, it's an absolute poster child for our digital thread. And it's teaching our customers how to think about the use of the digital thread, and it's teaching us how to perfect all the production technologies that we need to take full advantage of the digital trend.  So if I look at our -- just our sort of our wing fleets, I feel very good about where we are. And as you point out, the F-15 -- the new derivatives boy, they are really important to our customers. We feel great about the future. It feels like a new platform, frankly, from my perspective, I'm not going to hand out the production rates at this stage, but we're feeling pretty good about the international demand as well as our U.S. demand.  And you know -- in light of the only other choices, this gets, frankly, more valuable over time until the really new classified work ultimately was completed and brought to the market. Anyway, I feel quite good about the portfolio. It's development where we stand in it. And I'm sorry, some of the contracting methods that we used in the early going here, but anyway, we are where we are. And I can't get off the page without talking about the tanker, which we all still believe very, very strongly and, again, difficult contracting moment for us. On the other hand, futility to the Air Force has been fantastic.  The Vision system our commitment to it and then technologies beyond that allow for even autonomous refueling. These are things we're fully invested in, and we believe in the growth of the industry and the need with our customer. So anyway, there are other things, and you probably know a lot of that, but there's a reason to feel good, frankly, on the development front with respect to Boeing's defense business. John, we have time for one more question. Certainly, and that will be from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. I know it's been asked a thousand different ways, but I don't know if I know the answer yet. So maybe, Dave, can you give us an idea of how -- where you are on the MAX and 787 from a cash per aircraft perspective? Or how far that is below prior peak? And is there a cadence of that profitability, free cash flow as we think about production rates increasing, supply chain impacts and just pricing as you get aircraft out of inventory. Let me take a shot at the -- I'll talk cash margins, and let's start with the 787. So near term, they're pressured but positive, and we got to work through all the things that we've been describing. In long term, they're going to be higher than they were back in 2018, driven by productivity, pricing in the Dash 10 model. So the 87 feels like it's on the verge of doing some real special stuff over the long term. On the 37, near-term pressure because all the supply chain things we talked about, some customer mix things that we're going to battle through and possibly some impact to remarketing.  And then long term, it's going to be more or less in line with what it was before and the benefit being the productivity and the rate ramp. So that's kind of how we think about those 2 programs over time from a cash perspective. Really -- Sheila, you really have to get through calendar year '24. And then a lot of the cloud, a lot of the things that we've been wrestling with, the things that impact the -- our margins and the lumpiness along the way, that all begins to clear as we get to the tail end of '24. And as we think about '25 and on, I think that clarity will be apparent to everybody. And that concludes our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for joining. Thanks, everyone."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Q4 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.  With my introduction complete, I turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Phebe Novakovic. Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10.850 billion, operating earnings of $1.230 billion and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%.  So the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects, consistent with our forecast and sell-side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%; operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%; net earnings by $90 million or 10%; and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%; net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1%; and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.54, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment.  Let me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year. Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1x for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all-time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems.  Turning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance.  That said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed 3 potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter. The pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&D expenditures, the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the U.K. and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments. As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&D costs, we did not receive any payments from the U.K., though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations.  I'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022. Thanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release.  First, Aerospace. The story in aerospace has found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis. For the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only 1 more aircraft than we did in 2021. The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis aren't as attractive because 3 aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41.  As a result, Aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year. Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2x in the quarter and 1.4x at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The Aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5x.  To give you a little more color. Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past 2 years, over 400 net orders after defaults and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, Aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022, and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%. We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings.  With respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises. In summary, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet.  Next, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than 1/3 of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business, with particular strength in artillery rounds.  Not surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9%; and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward.  Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago of less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective may be of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate.  In addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2x book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia. Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings.  So Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies Group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023. The Technologies Group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021; and sequentially were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this.  For the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed.  With respect to backlog, the Technologies Group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition. And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1x book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they have been facing.  With that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022, Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels. We also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share.  With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022, and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully fund the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past 2 years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations.  However, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating, noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher-than-anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year.  We have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings.  The sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63.  And finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier.  That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe. Thanks, Jason. So let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up.  In 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2.  In Combat systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single-digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed. Continuing the better-than-expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF Award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point.  To the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business. As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 of around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies Group.  To give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single-digit pace consistent with the past 2 years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective, particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume was yield in operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry-leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022. So for 2023, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years. With sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year. As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital.  Let me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast.  With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A. Thanks, Phebe. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? This is the lead operator. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolf Research. I was hoping maybe you could touch on a couple of things. One, Jason, your new role and how you sort of think about balancing the act between the CFO and the operating segment roles and responsibilities which you intend to focus on there. And then maybe on the capital deployment front for '23 at 105%. Obviously, you've got a lot of excess cash. Should we expect you to pick up repurchase activity in '23 versus '22 or relatively similar? Myles, I think with respect to your first question, looking at the new responsibility and that opportunity. First and foremost, it's important to remember that these businesses are run by 2 excellent and accomplished presidents. And frankly, I have the highest level of confidence in them and their teams. When I look back over recent history in this role, Chris Marzilli really helped steer this business through a period of remarkable change and transformation, not to mention COVID and I don't think, as I look ahead, that this market is going to become any less dynamic. So I think the focus really is on continuing to make sure that the businesses continue to focus on their bottom line, earnings and cash as always. But frankly, also finding our way to a sustainable top line growth trajectory, and that will really be the emphasis. In terms of balancing the two, I'm humbled and honored to have this dual responsibility, fortunately entering my tenth role -- tenth year in the role as CFO. So I feel confident about the ability to handle both at the same time. So with respect to our capital deployment, we have -- we'll continue to invest in our business where prudent. We'll continue to maintain our dividend, and we'll repurchase shares accordingly. So I don't see any big change in the priorities for our execution. Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Phebe, could you touch on -- you mentioned 3 deliveries that slipped out. Was that customer preference? Was that supply chain related? And then it doesn't appear that you're going to -- your prior guidance was 148 deliveries this year, now you're talking 145. So it doesn't seem any makeup there. And then last thing, the 170, I think you forecasted for '24 deliveries. Does that still hold? Yes. So let me go in order. We had, as I noted, 3 airplanes have slipped into this quarter. One was simply an issue that we just couldn't get it completed in time and 2 of them were customer preferences for international deliveries. With respect to the production next year, we are confident that we can make that and our trajectory going forward past this year remains the same. So directionally, and -- we're right on track, and we're comfortable we get there. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Marine and the supply chain challenges at Electric Boat. And specifically, what we should be looking for in terms of any particular metrics, whether it's hiring or deliveries or certain milestones to get a sense that things are firming there and kind of also what the risk is of further deterioration in schedules. So let's deconstruct that. And I think we have to posit a few truth. We went into COVID with scheduled variants on Virginia. Virginia is also about 1/3 of the Electric Boat revenue. COVID had a profound impact on many aspects of our lives, but particularly lasting one on the workforce. We had labor discontinuities throughout the United States, and we also experienced something that we had not anticipated abnormally large retirement of experienced workers.  In a business that is heavily manpower dependent, these impacts had a disproportionate effect on additional schedule variants. We are working with the Navy who's been quite active and engaged in helping develop a plan and a really detailed action list on how to address these issues. And ship building and the supply chain are fixed by incremental improvements over time. So what do we see at the moment? We see stabilization in the workforce. I think across the nation, we've got a little bit better labor dynamics than we did immediately coming out of COVID. We also have additional experience in what some of the challenges have been.  So I -- the way I look at it. This year will give us a bit of a chance to dig further, see funds to the velocity of the material coming into Electric Boat. And that ought to be a good thing for all involved despite and notwithstanding the considerable issues around schedule. I would note that the Submarine Industrial base delivered 2 submarines last year, and we're going to deliver 2 more this year. So I think maintaining that cadence of delivery is important.  But in much of shipbuilding, milestones are difficult to identify really until you get the ship in the customers' hands. So as I said, we're working very closely with the Navy to ensure that we could just get back some of that schedule variance on the remainder of the Block 4 ships and on the Block 5 ships. Okay. Great. And maybe just to follow up specifically on that. Most of the discussion -- our discussion today and then the trade press has been about Virginia. How's the Columbia schedule holding up? So we're about 30% done on the first ship, and we are ahead of the contract schedule. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Phebe, maybe just to stay on Seth's line of question just on Marine. Maybe you could just -- there's been a lot written about just the industrial base, and you just mentioned it. How are you thinking about just maybe the CapEx profile and in particular, things start to get unveiled on [ ACs ], what the plans might be there? Just should we expect any further step-up in CapEx? Not with respect to [ ACs ].  And I think we have, as I've said on earlier calls and to many of you in person, we'll just take our lead from our Navy customer on how they want us to respond to all of this. So this is really an intergovernmental series of discussions and agreements. And we will, of course, support whatever the Navy plan is going forward. Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, just maybe just in general on the supply chain. You talked about the constraints in marine and some of the issues at Mission Systems has it gotten worse submission? Or do you think it's actually kind of stabilized? And this is just -- it is what it is, what's going on in the marketplace? So I think with respect to Mission Systems, we have to really focus on what it is we're talking about here, which is really chips and microelectronics, right? So unlike some of the other parts of the business, which are heavily labor and availability of workforce driven. So this is really, obviously, for Mission Systems an issue that's impacting industries much broader than just us or us in the Aerospace and Defense side.  And I think when these issues first surfaced, Mission Systems did a really nice job of developing workarounds, right? Finding alternate sourcing, certifying substitute parts and so on. So all of those actions were predicated on the expectation that the supply chain would kind of come through this and get over the hump within, call it, a year plus or minus. But frankly, as we've continued to work our way through it, it's become clear that we're not always at the top of the priority list for some of these sources of supply. So when they saw the bottlenecks we were dealing with were going to persist somewhat longer than expected, the team really adapted to this new normal with a whole new set of tactics.  That includes procuring key components with longer lead times anywhere from 12 to 18 or even 24 months. As well as working with key suppliers to improve the forecasting that we were giving them and the reliability of demand so that they could have confidence in where we were going and allocate additional capacity to us and our priorities. So all of that is in place and underway. As you might imagine, some of those things take a little longer to yield results. That's why we're expecting that to kind of come through in the second half of this year.  But we do feel like they've got a good plan in place. They've taken great corrective actions, and we just need to see that all sort of roll out and to get to the other side of this, but it's likely to be toward the second half back into this year before that all takes hold. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. You've talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the impact that the Ukraine could potentially have on Land Systems. Maybe from a bigger strategic point of view, it seems like in the past, the logic had always been the Army was a bill payer for the Navy and the Air Force. Is that -- are we learning a different lesson now out of the Ukraine? And what kind of implications potentially does that have for your Land Systems business? So if you look at the services funding over, I'd say, in the modern air post World War II, the Army gets funded when they're tactical challenges and tactical problems, either a hot war, relatively cold war preparedness. This is an issue where we've got both strategic challenges in which the Navy and the Air Force tend to get funded. And as I noted, the threat environment has materially changed. So that has driven increased interest in a number of Army and land forces capabilities. And as we've begun to see those show up in our in our backlog and in our order book, but we've got more room to grow and more room to go there as some of this demand converts into actual orders.  So when I think about what's going on in Europe, our European Combat Vehicle business has done quite well in securing a number of contracts, both historically but increasingly recently and on a goal -- what we expect on a going-forward basis. They've been active in Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg. By the way, I wrote all those down because that's a lot of countries. So I think the closer you are to the threat, the more urgent you feel your funding requirements. So all of which is to say, we have changed our expectations for Combat Systems growth.  By the way, overarching all of this is a need to increase our ammunition and projectile output, and we've been working with the Army for the last 3, 4, 5 months on exactly that kind of plan. So as we've always posited, the threat environment really drives this demand for defense products and we're seeing some of that now. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. I want to take the opportunity to ask you a question about the Technologies Group. I know you've been in the seat for just a small amount of time, but I'm curious to know as you settle into your seat, the kinds of investments that you think you might want to make either in technologies or new products and services or in processes BD in order to accelerate revenue. Just kind of get your first impressions on the needs there in the group and what might change with you now taking over leadership of that group. Sure. So I think the way to think about this group between GDIT and Mission Systems technologies taken together, is that we currently are and have been for quite some time, in a model and of the capability set that a lot of the peer companies out there are trying to get to. That is a well-balanced and comprehensive set of offerings between the traditional federal IT services offerings as well as cyber hardware and other elements of that portfolio. And so I don't think we have to necessarily play catch up as much in that game. I think there's always opportunities to refine and enhance the portfolio.  As I mentioned earlier, this is not going to stop being a dynamic environment. We are, as always, have continued to invest internally in new technology capabilities. That will continue to be the case. As you know, I'll say what I know Phebe would say if she were talking right now. We're not going to speculate about M&A. There's always the possibility for bolt-on acquisitions. I would note, by the way, since you brought up the point that since we acquired CSRA in 2018 and essentially transformed the face of this group with the size and capability of our federal IT services business. There have been -- if I look at GDIT's competitor group, call it, the top 5 or 6 main peers, there have been some 40 to 45 acquisitions in that space that those companies have taken on. And we have not done any, we've done a couple of small bolt-ons in Mission Systems during that time, but nothing in GDIT space. And so it's interesting to see how the others are behaving in the aftermath of that activity and a lot of the consolidation that's happened in the industry. But I think we put ourselves in very good stead, and we see a lot of others following suit. So I don't think there's a massive sea change in what we have planned ahead, but we'll continue to focus on maintaining our leading position in the market. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. So you margin was up a little bit sequentially in at Gulfstream and yet my understanding was you had some software warranty charges in the second and third quarter associated with the G500 and G600. So were there any other -- what were the reason the margins weren't a bit better there in Aerospace? The margins are pretty darn good. We have performed what we had told you. And so we were pretty pleased with that. I would note that one of the headwinds is R&D. So the additional work that has been required from the airworthiness directive and the new FAA requirements as a result of the MAX have driven increased R&D. And we'll continue to see some of that and then that will begin to unwind. But I think those are very strong margins and better that we had anticipated in our guidance to you. Okay. Great. And Jason, the guide for Mission Systems margins is down over 200 bps from where you've been. Once things start to sort out, where do you see Mission Systems margins can go? Can they go back to where they were? So I want to make sure I think you're saying technologies as a whole because we don't really give -- or business unit specific margin guidance within the group. But given what you're saying, I think if you look back to prior to the CSRA acquisition, when the IT services side of the business became, frankly, our largest business group and the lion's share, the sort of 2/3, if you will, or more of the technologies grew.  We used to -- the combined margin of those businesses used to be in the call it the low double-digit range, it's usually between 10% and 11% on a fairly consistent basis. Since we acquired CSRA, we've averaged over the past 5 years, 9.8% margin for the group. So what we're seeing right now is really just a shift in the moment where we've had GDIT come through that significant integration effort for the first couple of years followed immediately on the footsteps of that with the impacts of COVID, they've really embarked on a nice steady trajectory now of low single-digit growth for several years now, and we expect to see that continue.  As Mission Systems in the moment is dealing with the supply chain issues that have been, I think, well addressed, their volume is down a bit. So what we're seeing in terms of the group's margin, aggregate margin, is really nothing more than a shift in the mix between the 2. So that's with the increased service side of the business and the lower volumes on the product and hardware side of the business. So as Mission Systems comes through this and gets back on track to a growth level, which we do expect to see happen once they come through these issues. You ought to see the margin on an aggregate basis, tick back up.  And oh, by the way, that's not -- shouldn't overlook the fact that GDIT on its own is continuing to improve and harvest its margins as it grows. I think I said before, they had their highest margin as a business since we acquired CSRA and their highest earnings contribution to the company ever. So everything, I think, is headed in the right direction, just got to come through the supply chain issues at Mission Systems, and that will help influence the mix. And we ought to see a trend back up toward the 10% level over time. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Phebe, just following on to Ron's question earlier on combat and that was standing the flat outlook for this year, but you talked about the international demand, and it seemed like Congress added quite a bit of money for Stryker and Abrams to the '23 budget. So can you give us any sense of kind of the CAGR that you think is a reasonable expectation after 2023 when things begin to -- or when the demand begins to actually convert for you? So I think what we're looking at now is low single-digit growth. So if we see anything over time that accelerates that, we'll certainly let you know that that's our best planning in the moment in consultation with our customer. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Maybe overall on the defense portfolio as a whole, all 3 segments. When you think about it, you're guiding the business flat on the top line perspective and EBIT as well. The budget is up 10, and you have some pretty good programs in there. How do you think about that delta and when it catches up to the budget and EBIT growth resumes? So I think that's more in '24. One of the big issues there, as I said, is Virginia. And -- but look, the way I look at the defense portfolio, we have an extremely strong backlog and now it's just a question of executing. Executing across that portfolio. So I'm not too worried about growth on the defense side at all, nor on the aerospace side. There is one thing that I think we're focused on. We should be focused on. And I neglected to mention this earlier, but with respect to execution, one of the things that we can do on Virginia and frankly, at  EB  in general, is to continue to improve our operating performance. That provides us more ability to cover some of the perturbations that are coming out of the supply chain. So I really think about all of this as execution. Growth comes when it comes. We've got the backlog to support it. And so I like the position we're in, frankly. Great. And then if I could ask one more. I don't know if you provided it. Can you give us an update on the G700, G800 certification processes? So we still expect the G700 to convert -- get certified this summer. And the G800 will be about 6 months after that, so we don't see any change in that. And the relationship has been going very well with the FAA. So we are continuing to look forward to finishing all the certification processes. Now that I will tell you that is outside our complete control, a lot of this is FAA resources and their ability to focus, given all the other demands that they have on them, but so far so good. Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC. Guess, we lost him. Sorry about that. I was muted. I wanted to first ask, within Aerospace, really good growth in the services business. What's the outlook for services growth in '23 as part of the aerospace guide? And can you talk a little bit about investments that you're making in that business? We expect low single-digit growth in our service side. And we continue to invest prudently when we see the need for more service capacity. But at the moment, we're pretty -- nothing really outstanding in that regard. You've got the capacity to accommodate what we see as reasonable steady growth. Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick clarification on the 700 certification this summer. As obviously, you commented you're working with the FDA closely and a lot of this is -- or some of this is out of your control. How would you characterize your visibility or sort of the ongoing risks around I guess, FAA capacity to support that? I mean do you feel like you're well through that risk retirement? Or is there still substantial uncertainty and risk associated with that summer time frame? I think the FAA has done a good job managing its portfolio and a series of complex and multifaceted requirements. And so far, we are sticking to what we believe is a reasonable expectation for the certification. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Just a couple of quick ones from me, Phebe. First of all, on Ukraine, it looks like they're going to get Abrams tanks. At what point does capacity in some form or other particularly staffing become an issue? And then secondly, just for Jason, what sort of book-to-bill have you assumed in aerospace for 2023 in your cash flow guidance? Staffing is not an issue here. There is plenty of capacity on the combat vehicle side, both tracked and wheeled. So to the extent that the U.S. government intends to execute any contracts with respect to some of these bilateral agreements that they are developing. We can-- it's well within the capacity of the industrial base to accommodate. And then, Rob, with respect to your second question, as it relates to aerospace book-to-bill, much like going into 2022, we've assumed a return to a 1:1 book-to-bill, and that is one of the predicates for our cash flow forecast. So to the extent they outperform, obviously, that could provide some upside. Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Phebe, you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks. I was curious if you could comment a bit more in depth on the sales pipeline at Gulfstream and the latest trends you're seeing there, both from individual buyers and the corporate buyers. And then for Jason, I was just wondering if you could identify what the unbilled receivable balance was on Ajax at the end of the year. And how much of that you expect to burn down this year? With respect to our pipeline, I noted that it remains strong. I would also say that corporate America has been very active, both public and private companies, high net worth individuals. Europe remains slow. Middle East just picked up Southeast Asia, let's say, not China, has been increasingly active. So we've got a good demand across all of our offerings in all of our aircraft. And then on your second question, as it relates to the Ajax unbilled, that's at the end of the year, roughly $1.7 billion is where we stand right now. I don't want to get into the specifics of how much we expect to collect this year. That's part of ongoing discussions with that customer. But needless to say, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do have good reason to expect those cash receipts to resume before the end of this quarter. And so we'll start to see that unbilled balance come down. Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We'll take one more question, please. And then we'll wrap the call up. Very good. Our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Phebe, going back to an earlier question on entry into service for 700 and 800. When would -- might we expect the R&D to decline? I don't know how much the 400 would use? And what would the incremental margins at Gulfstream look like once that happens. I imagine that's 24 or is it 25? So I think we expect R&D to begin to go down at the end of next year. And look, we have Gulfstream is an extremely high-performing operationally strong company. And so I think we have demonstrated incremental improvement in margins as our operating efficiency and discipline in our supply chain, engineering. And really on the shop floor, all of that has improved. So I think there's upward over time, margin opportunity, but we're not going to get into parsing specifics until we have good clarity. But we're very comfortable that we will improve steadily and repeatedly. Okay. And just a clarification on the FAA. You talked about it earlier. Are we still -- are they still in the discovery process as they evolve their system after what's happened at peers over the past couple of years? Or is there a set process that is in stone at this point? Yes. I think that that's a broader question than I'm able to answer. What I can tell you is that our relationship and working relationship with the FAA has matured significantly. And we think we all have a very clear understanding of what the new requirements are and how to execute them. Okay. Thank you very much. And thank you all for joining us today on this call. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the fourth quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached later today on my office at (703) 876-3117. Operator? There are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. And as a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has 1 reporting segment, and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to John. Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn to discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, I'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in the media articles and a related complaint filed in October with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete. Regarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles. With respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including by implication, FPL. The FEC process is a confidential civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so. We plan to file a response seeking dismissal of the FEC complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million, and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us. With that behind us, I would like to now discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year in 2022, and both businesses have never been better positioned. The cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last 2 decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward. At the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. Before IRA, we largely qualified for 2 federal incentives, wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits. We always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years. Some years, they were extended. Others, they were not. The uncertainty changed customer behavior and it changed our behavior. Today, the incentives are clear. They support a broader range of renewable technologies. They are in place for a much longer period of time, and they incentivize the domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the U.S.A., creating new American jobs. In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders. So today, I am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, and I look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes. In 2022, NextEra Energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. As a result of strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources, we achieved the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. NextEra Energy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022 despite a challenging year in the financial markets. In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Utility (sic) [ Utilities ] Index on a 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the S&P 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both FPL and Energy Resources, and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward. We have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 is no exception. Despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in American energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Overcoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. While disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities, and I am extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 and delivering adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14%. During 2022, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in America. Despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class nonfuel O&M cost per megawatt hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021. We also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills. We placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022, and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023 bringing our total solar build-out to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first 2 years of our current rate agreement. Our relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1000-kilowatt hour residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in 8 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Ian and Nicole. And during the year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, FPL used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers. Looking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year. With economics driving strong demand for renewables, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog, as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the United States. Within -- with the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead. Our continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at NextEra Energy. Last June, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader U.S. economy. In August, the IRA helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history. Over the next 2 decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage. At FPL, our plan is to lower cost for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage and eventually hydrogen. By transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of Florida achieve energy independence. Our customers have already seen the positive impacts of the IRA on their bills. We estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. This month, those savings started with a onetime $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects. With only about 5% of FPL's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio. In April, FPL expects to file its annual Ten Year Site Plan which will present our generation resource plan through 2032. Last year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. By incorporating the IRA benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity, and this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. We believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future. At Energy Resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices and the broader push towards decarbonization across the economy, enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions. These comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and in addition to new renewables can include renewable fuels, hydrogen and behind-the-meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables. Customers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. And we believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions-reduction goals. We are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost effectively lower emissions. We are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position. We are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way. And we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. Last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen related facility in development in the Central United States. Additionally, Energy Resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the Southwest and Southeast. Earlier in the month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. In the Southeast, our plan is to support 140 tons per day clean hydrogen facility at our Gulf Clean Energy Center that would be powered by FPL solar projects. In the Southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in Arizona in partnership with Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the United States, with whom we recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the West Coast mobility and industrial end markets. These are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing. We continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions, and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us. At our investor conference in June last year, we announced Energy Resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. In sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then existing tax law. Typically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior. Then after-tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. Even though tax credits were extended with the IRA, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables. It is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables, combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages, that today, we are extending our development expectations at Energy Resources through 2026. We now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026. If you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new 4-year development expectations at Energy Resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous 4-year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year. To put these numbers into context, just executing at the low end of our new development expectations through 2026, would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Due to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities of both FPL and Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings per share growth expectations at NextEra Energy by an additional year through 2026. For 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% of the 2024 adjusted EPS range. This equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in each of 2023, '24, '25 and '26, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which had another terrific year of execution while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. For 2022, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by approximately 15% year-over-year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. This growth is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. Our confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the IRA, against a backdrop that we believe includes at least 2 decades of clean energy incentives. We expect NextEra Energy Partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both Energy Resources and from third parties to continue to be robust. NextEra Energy Partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by NextEra Energy Partners for 2024 through 2026.  Additionally, earlier this month, NextEra Energy Partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interest on 2 of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million. These transactions are intended to enable NextEra Energy Partners to take advantage of the IRA's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third parties. With the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, NextEra Energy Partners can now fully access 2 cash flow streams for unitholders, project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of PTCs. Taken together, NextEra Energy Partners expect these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders.  The significant tailwinds provided by the IRA and Energy Resources' future renewables outlook, combined with NextEra Energy Partners' third-party M&A and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility. As a result, today, we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NextEra Energy Partners by another year. We now see 12% to 15% per year growth in per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We believe that NextEra Energy Partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have never been better positioned. We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade. And we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Kirk, I'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we're announcing this morning. After 20 years with NextEra Energy, Eric Silagy, has notified me of his intention to retire from FPL where he has led the team for 11 years. Eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement. And under his leadership, FPL has been transformed into the nation's largest and most reliable electric utility. Over the last decade, Eric has led the efforts to modernize FPL's generating fleet, make it one of the cleanest, lowest cost and most fuel-efficient in the country. His commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by FPL's award-winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average and the best reliability in the country. Last year during hurricanes Ian and Nicole, I saw firsthand Eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the FPL team to quickly restore power and quickly get the state of Florida back on its feet. Over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, Eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. His advocacy across the state has helped to foster Florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system and grow the next generation of Florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments. I want to thank Eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life.  With Eric's departure, we are excited to welcome Armando Pimentel, back to NextEra Energy as FPL's President and CEO. As you know, Armando previously served as NextEra Energy's and FPL's CFO and the President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. As a lifelong Floridian, Armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. He is also a good friend and colleague, who I've worked closely with for many years. And I am confident that under Armando's leadership, FPL will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Eric, who will make some personal remarks. Thank you, John. I want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for NextEra Energy. This company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry, and I couldn't be more proud of the results that we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. When I joined NextEra Energy in 2003, FPL relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in America. We knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio, and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill. Today, that long-term vision has saved FPL customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years. That's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets, helped them pay for their kids' education, take their families on vacation or pay for any other family expenses. These efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid, and it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations. Ultimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the state of Florida billions of dollars. These are just a few examples of how we've transformed FPL into one of America's cleanest, most affordable and most reliable energy companies.  While saying goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, I know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of FPL. The last year has been one of the most challenging of my career, given the number of distractions, including 2 hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few. When John became CEO of NextEra Energy last year, I committed to him that I would stay in my role for at least 1 more year and have now satisfied that commitment. In April, I'll mark my 20th anniversary with NextEra Energy, at which point I will have led the FPL team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most CEOs. We have 2 more years of execution before our next rate case proceeding, which is, as all of you know, an all-consuming process. And then I just wasn't sure that I could fully commit to. So I feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of FPL to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years. It's been the greatest honor of my career to lead the FPL team and I cannot thank our nearly 10,000 FPL employees, thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting the customers first. They have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day. In my opinion, and I'm a little biased, FPL is the best utility in the world. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished and is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. I wish John, Armando and the entire FPL team all the best in their future endeavors. And now let me turn the call over to Kirk for more details. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $763 million or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2022, FPL reported net income of $3.7 billion or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the 4-year term of our current rate agreement. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion. For the fourth quarter, FPL's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather, as well as an approximately $40 million pretax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve. For the full year 2022, FPL's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion. Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at FPL in 2022. Beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date later this year. Earlier this week, FPL filed with the Florida Public Service Commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. Under our proposed plan, FPL utilizes its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April '23. Additionally, FPL's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel costs recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to FPL's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022. We believe this proposal is a reflection of FPL's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers. Separately, FPL is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. Under FPL's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in April 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms. Taking both proposals together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000-kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of April 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for Florida investor-owned utilities. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs and Florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although we have seen the growth rates stabilize, 3-month average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including an 11% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies.  During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. For 2022, FPL's retail sales increased 1% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income of $996 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million or $0.20 per share. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $285 million or $0.14 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion or $1.23 per share. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' full year GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Energy Resources' full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. As we previously highlighted, the Commerce Department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. As a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022. We anticipate that Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023, when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to high margins -- higher margins in our customer-facing businesses and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. Our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year-over-year. All other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt balances, reflecting growth in the business. Additional details of our full year 2022 results at Energy Resources are shown on the accompanying slide. As John mentioned, Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar and 670 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes, for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals, but perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar plus storage. Today, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the IRA. Our revised expectations are by far the largest expected 4-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. The accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at Energy Resources, now stands. As you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year, and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers. And we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of China. We believe the Commerce Department's preliminary determination on circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties late last year, clarified that solar panels manufactured in Southeast Asia, using wafers and cells produced outside of China, are not circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty laws. We are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the 2-year waiver period. Finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.52 billion or $0.76 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1 billion or $0.51 per share, respectively. For the full year 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.15 billion or $2.10 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year were roughly flat compared to the prior year. As John mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all sectors. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy. And this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings. Additionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow. And in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year-over-year despite FPL being under recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes Ian and Nicole. As a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities.  Finally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. As John discussed, today, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. For 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up approximately 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. Fourth quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first 3 quarters of the year. For the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year-over-year and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021. Existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year with the benefit of higher net generation for both wind and solar, partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021. NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full year. Relative to the growth in NextEra Energy Partners' full year adjusted EBITDA, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021. Over the past 5 years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year-over-year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the IPO. During 2022, NextEra Energy Partners executed several low-cost financings, continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. During the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million, with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years to be  funded by the investors' share of ongoing portfolio cash flows.  In December, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon which, along with a cap call entered into at the time of the financing, provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the net unit price at the time of issuance. The implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. These transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of NextEra Energy Partners successful financing execution throughout 2022. In May 2022, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available. With this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners still has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuance, whether for maturities or net new issuances. Taken together, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set, which has expanded as a result of the IRA. The significant opportunity set and NextEra Energy Partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 and to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners' run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions at December 31, 2023, remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion, and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth, both in the near term and long term. Near term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. Long term, we believe that the low cost of renewables, combined with our -- with other clean energy solutions, enabled in part by the IRA provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Yes. So just a couple of questions on the management changes. So you don't appear to be making any connection between the investigation and Eric's retirement. Could you just confirm if that's correct or not? And then, I guess, secondly, just thoughts on, often with these successions, you'd bring somebody kind of internally up. So maybe thoughts on bringing Armando back, who we know well, but just as opposed to kind of bringing someone internally up. Yes. Thanks, Steve. First of all, on your first question on connection, we're not making a connection. Eric, when I was first chosen to succeed Jim, Eric and I had a conversation. Eric said, \"look, I will give you a 1-year commitment, stay at the company. And we would talk about it at the end of the year.\" Eric satisfied that commitment to me. 2022, obviously, was a year with a lot of challenges, the distractions Eric went through in his prepared remarks. But when you think about all the challenges that he had to overcome, with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation, and the supply chain and the media allegations and all those things, I think it took a toll on Eric that year and gave me his retirement notice.  And it's -- the way I look at it is, it's a little earlier than I would have hoped Eric would have wanted to do it. And so we have a very deep bench over at FPL, I'm going to your second question now, a very deep bench at FPL. We have a lot of terrific folks that we could move into Eric's role. We have 1 individual in particular, Christopher Chapel. He is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer as part of the transition. We're bringing Armando back as well. And Armando has been just a terrific friend to me. I have a lot of respect for Armando. I had the good fortune to work with Armando for roughly 15 years. And I think he will do a great job of bringing Christopher along, who I think, in the future, will just make an outstanding CEO of FPL. But he -- Christopher has been running customer service. He needs to get a little bit more experience on the operations side and working with the regulatory team and then on the financial side, getting us ready for the rate case. And I think the combination of Armando working together with Christopher, that is a very powerful team. And they will do a tremendous job working together to execute on behalf of FPL. And I think Christopher has a very, very bright future with our company. And all of you will have a chance to get to know him and to meet him in the near future. Some of you have had that chance in the past, and I think that should be a familiar name to some of our investors.  And Steve, I wanted just Eric to say a few words as well. Steve, let me jump in here a little bit. Look, because I'm sure you can appreciate these kind of decisions are never easy, and there's no ever perfect time. As John said, with the transition of leadership last year, I gave John a commitment that I'd be here for at least a year. I didn't have any real hard time line set. But I've been in the chair for 11 years. This will be going into my 12th year. And my predecessor had been on the job for 10 years. Jim had been in his job for 10 years. Before that, Lewis Hay had been in his job for 10 years. And as I look forward to, this is the kind of job that you have to plan ahead and we're getting ready to go in another rate case cycle. I mean that's a multiyear type of approach. And so, to go forward longer means I'm really committing to 2026. So a lot of factors come into play. John touched on all of the challenges in 2022. I'm really, really proud of how the team handled them, but it's a 24-hour day job, and there were a lot of challenges that we successfully managed, but it's a decision that is not easy. But I feel good about moving forward and putting -- doing it when the company is in its strongest financial and operational position it's ever been in with a very strong leadership team, I think that's the right time to do it. Great. I appreciate that color. That's the main question we've been getting from people. So just 1 other thing on the wind -- excuse me, on the backlog, it seems like there's a big increase in wind expectations for the next 4 years, as the main driver of the higher backlog. Could you just give more color on what's driving, is that just the extension of the credits or other things leading to more wind expectations through '26? Steve, it's Rebecca, and I'll chime in on that. It is exactly what John and Kirk highlighted and what we've been talking about for the last couple of months following IRA. With IRA provisions, we now have extensions of incentives now through the end of the decade, well, decade plus. But just looking at visibility, it's exceptional now through the end of the decade and likely well beyond that. And it is a big change specifically for wind in this time frame, adding the 100% production tax credit now obviously through this expectation windows through it fully.  And it's also supported by the backdrop of what I also have highlighted to you all. And John talked about in his remarks about all of the positive follow-on effects from strong incentives on renewables and through the introduction of a hydrogen production tax credit, we're starting to see substantial demand and positive engagement around renewables to create green hydrogen and hydrogen-related products thereafter. So our development team is busy having the types of conversations we've never had before, and we can't be more excited about what's ahead. And that's for wind, solar, storage and the hydrogen products that we're talking about. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Congrats Eric, on your stellar career. Armando, welcome back. It feels a little bit like when [ Murray ] came back in 2009 here, I must admit. Maybe just related to some of the changes here, just to follow up on that super quick. First off, is Armando committing to the full process here as you alluded to, the rate case cycle being a little bit protracted. And then related to that, what is the final timing in terms of this internal process that you guys had underway for the 8-K? And is that impacted at all by this pending FEC process that you alluded to taking upwards of the balance of the year here? Yes. Let me go ahead and take those, Julien. This is John. So first of all, on our -- with Armando. Armando is committed. He's coming back as our CEO and President of FPL, Armando is committed. So let me just say that. And again, as I said, he's inheriting just a terrific team. I would say easily, in my own belief, the best team in the industry. And it's a team Eric built and did an outstanding job building and there's just a lot of strength there. And Armando has a good fortune of being able to lead that organization. And with Christopher Chapel, as I said, too taking on that Chief Operating Officer role, I think that's quite a 1-2 punch that we're going to have over at FPL, combined with existing strength that we already have on the bench there. And the other thing I'll mention is that, in Eric, we have the good fortune of Eric staying through the middle of May, which will help ensure a very smooth transition for both Armando moving into that role and for Christopher, having a chance to step up, and Eric will do a great job on that transition and making sure all the right relationships or transition as part of that. That's the first piece. The second piece, you talked about the internal process and timing. First of all, let me just cover one more time. I mean, we are substantially complete. On the Florida side, as I said in my comments, we do not believe that FPL would be found liable of federal campaign finance violation based on our investigation. And second, with regard to the FEC process, let me just say a few words about the FEC process, just so everybody understands exactly what it is. The Federal Election Commission has civil enforcement authority. Anybody in the United States can file a claim with the FEC. And given the political environment that we're in today, I would certainly expect even an uptick in more claims being filed with the FEC. But any citizen can file a complaint. That's where we are right now. A citizen special interest group filed a complaint. There is no formal legal proceeding or any proceeding with the FEC right now. The FEC will take 12 to 18 months to decide whether or not there is a reason to believe that they should investigate this further. And we will file a motion for dismissal. We think that a claim like this that's based solely on media reports and allegations is not the type of a claim the FEC should take up. If you read the complaint, the complaint details 5 different scenarios. They -- those, if you add up all the contributions in those scenarios, they don't exceed $1.3 million. And so when we look at the FEC process as a whole and the FEC complaint as a whole, we do not believe that the federal allegations taken as a whole, as I said, would have a material impact on our business. Got it. And then just super quickly, if I can. Just with respect to the originations here, the 1.7 gigawatts since the third quarter call, this seems a little bit down from the last quarterly call update on the slides. Can you comment a little bit about the trends? Obviously, I'm cognizant of the comments you made about the overall expectation through '26. How do you think about that materializing, and the pace and just what customer feedback is in putting in orders \"now\" versus in subsequent periods? Yes. Let me take that, Julien. The first thing I would say is the demand for renewables is as strong as ever. When I look at the opportunities that the development organization has right now, they are significant. I mentioned in my remarks, the term sheet we signed on the 800-megawatt facility, in the central part of the U.S. for a green hydrogen facility that we didn't even account, for example. And we have a lot of interest around hydrogen right now that's going to fuel a lot of renewable opportunities. The C&I market is extremely strong. We are just seeing a lot of demand across the board. And so I think that's why you see with the revised development expectations, 42 gigawatts on the high end. Oh my gosh, I mean, think, those of you that have been following the company for a long time, 42 gigs, that's a 15% uptick on the last 4-year set that we had. I mean, just to put it in perspective, I mean, FPL's total generation fleet is 27 gigawatts. So to -- 42 gigs over a 4-year period, hopefully, that provides a little color and context. The next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. It's actually Constantine, here for Shar. And just wanted to wish Eric the best in the next step. Certainly, I appreciate that. Maybe as a quick follow-up instead of doing a question and maybe just on the -- then you've noted higher impacts of the IRA having some pull and push on the demand for renewables. And maybe just specifically on the details of the cadence of the growth to reach those '26 targets, front-end loaded, back-end loaded? Anything there? Constantine, it's Rebecca. I think the best place to point you to is the development expectations slide that Kirk went through. It's Slide 12 in the materials, and it lays out the ranges by technology for '23 and '24 and then '25 and '26. And obviously, there's a significant increase in going into '25 and '26, really for all the things that we're talking about, the significant momentum, also a lot of resolution over the last couple of months and clarity around some of the supply chain disruption that we've seen on the solar side. So it is building and the momentum, as John highlighted so well, remains exceptionally strong on the development and origination side. So I'm really excited about everything that we see in our traditional businesses as well as the commercial and industrial sector. And then, of course, the burgeoning opportunities that we see on the green hydrogen and related product side. Excellent. And on a related note, on the kind of upside from repowering opportunities, do you have any thoughts on kind of solar and storage type of repowering? I know that's a -- when they're starting to make an exit plan. Just curious on the other side. Yes. We're looking at it. And there's a -- we think there's opportunities over time to repower both battery storage projects as well as on the solar side. They can be a little bit more complex, and we're certainly looking for some guidance as we go through this year from treasury on this point as well as others that will be helpful in giving us context, but some of this is also timing. So as you get more mature projects, obviously, 10 years on the wind side, 5-plus years on the solar side, will be opportunities then really to expand the horizon for repowering. But as I talk to our team every day, we're looking at our existing generation portfolio. And I see more opportunities today to enhance the value of our existing portfolio than we've ever seen before. That, of course, includes repowering. It includes adding battery storage. It includes thinking differently because of the exciting opportunities around green hydrogen. About even sizing some of those load opportunities, the electrolysis equipment to produce that hydrogen at existing assets. And we're also making investments in transmission across a variety of the integrated system operation markets to be able to add transmission to increase the value of the existing portfolio. So we think there's tons of opportunities and so much more certainty looking forward than we've ever had before because of the clarity around the incentives. The next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. I was wondering if you could comment on just your latest experience with access to solar panels supply, whether there's any risk that you see for executing on this year's development plan? And how the UFLPA law has been impacting projects? Sure. Dave, this is Kirk. I'll take that. So the last time we spoke, I believe, was on the third quarter earnings call, and we shared with you that as our integrated supply chain team had worked and certainly had a challenging year in 2022. But as we highlighted on the earnings call today, despite that challenging year, they did a really admirable job. We were able to still put into service, 5,000 megawatts. And I think that really speaks to their ability to navigate that disruption. And certainly, part of that disruption was what you highlighted, which was the challenges around the ports and trying to work through the panels that have been detained at the ports. And as I mentioned, the challenges around the -- in the third quarter that we highlighted with some of the panels being detained there, what we've seen since the third quarter call is some positive improvement. We've seen some of the panels that had previously been detained, released. And so I would describe it as positive movement, we continue to see each day some positive movement. So we're continuing to monitoring it. We're watching it closely. The team is actively working with our suppliers and continuing to monitor it. But compared to where we were in the third quarter, I think we are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing progress.  And at least from our perspective, we continue to feel like it's something that we can manage in terms of continuing to deliver for our customers. Okay. Great. And on the renewables development program, I was wondering if green hydrogen is starting to have an impact on the back end of the plan in terms of influencing the renewables demand outlook, yet? Like in 2026, are you starting to kind of weave in expected demand on renewables for -- from green hydrogen at that point? It's certainly something -- it's Rebecca, it's obviously something that we considered when we were setting the development expectations and what we laid out today for you all. I can tell you from a practical standpoint, it very much is starting to show up in the conversations that we're looking at, including the 800-megawatt term sheet that we signed in recent weeks for a project that would be expected to COD in 2026. At this point, I think there are a number of folks and ourselves included, working hard to put the right development opportunities together, but it is a very active market. We're really excited about opportunities to partner with key folks. Linde, among them, as we talked about on the call, but others as well to put forward terrific projects and really bring forward the promise of this technology that we've now been talking about, but it's really coming to reality. I think '26 is probably on the earlier side of what we ultimately will see is a significant ramp-up going into the end of the decade, where there's more opportunity to have supply ramp up for electrolyzers and as well as other related equipment for some of those green hydrogen related products. As well as working through the development opportunities and establishing the ultimate customers for these products. But everything I see is really exciting and really starting to take shape just now, a number of months after the IRA provisions were ultimately passed into law. This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

         "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.  During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. [Operator Instructions]  But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon? Thank you, Martin. So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. It was our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.  So in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges. So it's worth noting that all these records were in the face of massive difficulties. Credit to the team for achieving that.   The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So I mean that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.   So we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole. So basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer. And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is. And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so. And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on cost control. And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yes.  With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data shows that improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.  Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energy density.  So energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worth remembering that the 3 pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind, because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So you have those 3 things. You can convert all of earth to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually.  So I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and we -- our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible. So yes, so we were ramping up Megapack production. And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our legal output.  So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins. As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer. But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength. And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1 Investor Day. And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year. Congratulations, guys. Thanks, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well. Yes. Thanks, Martin. So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla. I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year.  On a full year basis, revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading. Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further. For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S. and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.  Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by 3 factors: first is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls; second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.  Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles. The energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage. While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory.  As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost. There are 3 key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins.  In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where inefficiencies are the highest. But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability. This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example.  As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well. In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure. Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term. However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year.  Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map. This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business. We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month. Thank you. Thank you very much, Zach. Let's now go to investor questions. The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter. This has raised demand concerns. Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates? I think... We already answered that question. Yes, exactly. Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result. Thank you. The second question is in similar vein. What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels? We've answered that one as well.  So let's go to the next one. The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells/packs, so $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour, for autos and energy products? And how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits? I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some. Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant. You can do the math. If we were to get anywhere near 1,000 gigawatt-hours of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant. So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it will -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic. We think it probably will be very significant in the future. Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations here are still in flux and there continues to be updates, so this is just our best understanding at the moment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.  And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize, is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways. And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this.  But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers. And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in our products going forward. And so as we're thinking about our pricing changes in the U.S. a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not only from this that were [ received ] to some extent, but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $7,500 per car of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps. So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill. Thank you very much. The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analysts released expectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models. Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts? Yes, go ahead, Zach. Yes, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and credits, and then $47,000 ASP across all models. And so 2 other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1. And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.  The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is. And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well because that is what we're primarily managing to now. Yes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.  So that means that there's millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin. And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows. And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet. That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history. Yes. Thank you. Let's go to the next investor question. Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show Tesla brand... YouGov. [ You can crush them with your life ]. Show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division among partisan lines. Such brand damage can impact demand. Does Tesla track favorability? And how will any brand image be mitigated? Well, let me check my Twitter account. Okay, so I've got 127 million followers. It continues to grow very rapidly. That suggests that I'm reasonably popular. It might not be popular with some people, but for the vast majority of people, my follower count speaks for itself. I have the most interactive account -- social media account, I think, maybe in the world, certainly on Twitter, and that actually predated the Twitter acquisition.  So I think Twitter is actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla. And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them drive sales just as it has with Tesla. So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously. Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the 4680 ramp. What are the current roadblocks? And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week? Yes. Thanks, Martin. First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4. It was no small feat. Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work. As far as where we stand, in Texas, 1 of 4 lines are in production, with the remaining 3 in stages of commissioning and install. Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck.  Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible. Between 2 of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024. Thank you. Next investor question is, Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck. Is that still the current plan? Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4? Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4. And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line, but it will be next year. So it's an incredible product. I can't wait to drive it personally. It will be the car that I drive every day. I actually just -- I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass. And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special.  So yes, so with respect to upgrading cars on -- that have Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed. Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human. So [indiscernible] how do we get ultimately to -- let's say, for argument's sake, if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%. It will be Hardware 5 beyond that.  But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road. But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant. So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so. Thank you. The next question is for Zach. Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies? Yes. I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. So we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year. We're growing 20% a quarter so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.  And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets. And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're setting up insurance for the first time as opposed to going back and switching when they already have insurance set up. So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business. No, go ahead. No, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting this business, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given that we're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priority here. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costs low and insurance stays affordable to our customers. Yes. And so there are 2 really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas. So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost -- or insurance costs even when they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the [ gigas ] of the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas. So it's great. So it has an amplified effect, very important.  Then it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas for all Teslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing a Tesla if it's in a collision and for Tesla Insurance. And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into that because the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost, in some cases, were unreasonably high.  So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving for active safety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback for, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's car is in an accident -- most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents.  But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands. And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we're making -- just to emphasize another key point because some of these points might be [ less ], so I apologize for being repetitive.  But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part -- providing spare parts needed for collision repair have an enormous effect on the repair cost. So if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car. It's extremely expensive. And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive. So this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness. Thank you. The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for midyear? We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer. But I always like try to downplay the start of production because the start of production is always very slow. It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first. So I wouldn't put too much thought in start of production. It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year. Yes, that's [indiscernible]. Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of all the production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops. We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said, the ramp will really come 2024. Yes, exactly. And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage, where should Tesla build the next Megapack factories? How many are needed on each continent? It's a good question. It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully. But really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production. And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next that answer that question. Thank you. Okay. And now let's go to analyst questions. The first analyst question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Just firstly, it sounds like your 1.8 million unit volume indication for this year is somewhat more supply-constrained than demand-constrained. Then I have a follow-up on cost. Is that an accurate statement? Well -- okay. I mean our internal production potential is actually closer to 2 million vehicles, but we were saying 1.8 million because, I don't know, there just always seems to be some freaking force majeure thing that happens somewhere on earth. And we don't control if there's like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera. So if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year. We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential. So -- and I think there would be demand for that, too. Yes. And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga things, processes, not at rate. Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter?  And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from -- on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night? If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity. I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the -- of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35. Yes. I mean the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on [ using ] the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean that's been a key focus of ours, and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus. Yes. And it goes back to the point I was making. I said it several years ago, I think Tesla's really the competitive strength that will be, by far, the hardest for other companies to replicate is Tesla being just d*** good at manufacturing and having the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world. And if you've got that sort of advanced manufacturing toolbox, you can apply it to many things and we're applying it now to battery cells.  I should also say that there -- we have other products in development. We're not going to announce them, obviously, but they're very exciting. And I think it will blow people's minds when they -- when we reveal them. Tesla has the most exciting product road map of any company on earth by a long shot. And we'll continue to, I think, be in that position. We've got more great ideas. I mean we know what to do here. So the future is very exciting.  As I said in the last call, there's going to be bumps along the way and we'll probably have a pretty difficult recession this year, probably. I hope not, but probably. And so one can't predict the short-term sort of stock value because when there's a recession and people panic in the stock market, then prices of stocks -- well, the value of stocks can drop sometimes to surprisingly low levels. But long term, I am convinced that Tesla will be the most valuable company on earth. Thank you. And I think, Zach, there was a question on cost headwind in Q4. Yes. I mean our weighted average COGS for the company, if you were to assume Austin and Berlin were at the cost structure of our other factories, it was on the order of [ 2,000 to 2,500 ] of headwinds. So I think from there, you can back into margin impact of those factories as of end of Q4. Thank you very much. And let's go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Zach, actually, I'd like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost. If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021. And then the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas. And this quarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point last year.  And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas? And I think input cost, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car. Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic? The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control. We're doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedites, logistics, attacking everything. On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go. And we're not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, as what we've seen from our forecast here, cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels. So I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'll make progress. And we'll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't have control over.  [indiscernible], is there anything on that? Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture benefits of indexes tapering out, but due to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reflected in our financials. And while aluminum is down like 20% year-over-year, steel is about 30% down year-over-year, the global non-cells raw materials market continues to be influenced by geopolitical situations in Europe, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due to natural disasters like typhoon in Korea 4 months ago, pandemic lockdowns.  So we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertain exactly when. In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to produce cars. Sorry, do you want to go say something? I was going to say, we're also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the 3, Y fleet. And we're gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't know we had out of the product. So over the course of 2023, on the powertrain side, we're actually going to go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need or we have more content than we need without impacting reliability at all. And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023. So we're not just sort of relying on supply. We're also doing design actions to bring cost out. My guess is if the recession is a serious one, and I think it probably will be but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs. So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin. I'm just guessing here. So this is -- that would be my guess. So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been like amazing in the quality of the product but also its rollout. And so I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today? So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already? Or is that too early to really see like -- to expect like an uptick in the take rate? The trend is very strong towards use of FSD. And as you alluded to, the -- with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases. And so I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI companies. This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side. With the Hardware 3 inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at this point, 5 years old from the design point. And with Hardware 4 coming and then Hardware 5 beyond that where there are significant leaps. And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year. And we're seeing just a lot of world-class AI talent join the company.  There's also the long-term potential of Optimus where we're able to use our expertise in electric motors and power electronics, batteries and advanced manufacturing to be able to make a humanoid robot that is actually useful and can be made at high volume with exceptional capabilities because of the autopilot AI that -- where we take the -- because the car is like a robot on 4 wheels and Optimus is a robot on legs.  But the -- as we get closer and closer to solving real-world AI, and we don't see anyone even close to us in achieving this, the value -- I think you appreciate this and a few others do, but most don't know what I'm talking about. And so -- but it's -- this is the thing that has order of magnitude, potential market cap improvement for Tesla. And the next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. So a quick 1 on FSD. This is, I guess, for Zach. Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD. But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred. Yes. I mean the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has 2 components. There's enhanced autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website. We fully recognize that. Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers, and we've released a portion of that. And then there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there. . And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates. Okay. Great. And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning. It's a lot of batteries, basically, and presumably, you won't be putting all of those in Tesla Semi. So I guess 2 questions about that incremental capacity.  First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your entire range of products? And if the answer is yes, then if you had to guess, how do you think that 100 gigawatt-hours would be allocated between your various end markets? I don't know. This is a bit too much guessing at this point. Yes. But -- yes. Yes. I mean you're right. Not all of the 100 gigawatt-hours are going to go into the Semi trucks. That is correct. I alluded to a number of future products. Those future products would use the 4680. Thank you. And the next question comes from George from Canaccord Research. So you recently adjusted prices, and that may have put many of your competitors in the back foot. In addition to that, capital markets have recently gotten a lot tougher. So with those factors in mind, I'm curious how you see the current competitive landscape changing over the next few years. And who do you see as your chief competitors 5 years from now? Five years is a long time. As with the Tesla order part, AI team, until late last night, and just we're asking [indiscernible], so who do we think is close to Tesla with -- a general solution for self-driving? And we still don't even know really who would even be a distant second. So yes, it really seems like we're -- I mean right now, I don't think you could see a second place with a telescope, at least we can't. So that won't last forever. So in 5 years, I don't know, probably somebody has figured it out. I don't think it's any of the car companies that we're aware of. But I'm just guessing that someone might figure it out eventually. So yes. I mean beyond that, Elon, like in the vehicle space, even though the market is shrinking, we're growing and EVs have doubled almost year-over-year. So like it -- whoever keeps up with the trend of EVs is going to be our competitor. The Chinese are scary, we always say that. But like a lot of people always look at the EV market share, but we always look at it is how much of the total vehicle space do we have, and we're just going to keep growing in that space. There's 95% for us to go get. Yes. And I don't want to say like -- I think we have a lot of respect for the car companies in China. They are the most competitive in the world. That is our experience. And the Chinese market is the most competitive. They work the hardest and they work the smartest. That's -- so a lot of respect for the China car companies that we're competing against. And so if I would have guessed, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla.  We are -- our Tesla China team is winning in China. And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China. So hopefully, that continues. So yes, so we're fired up about the future, and yes, well, it's going to be great. Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles. You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline. Are there maybe some plans to accelerate commercial vehicle form factors outside of the Tesla Semi to help accelerate EV adoption? Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I'm not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try. Yes, of course, of course. So -- we actually always look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles? Because if the -- for the longest time, we've been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output. And so people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market? Well, it doesn't really help if all you're doing is shuffling around the batteries from 1 car to another. In fact, it hurts because you add complexity but you don't add incremental volume.  So it's sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability of lithium-ion batteries. So as we get -- so we want new product introduction to match where the cells are available or that new product to use those cells without cannibalizing the cells of the other cars. That's the actual limiting factor if we need new models, not anything else, really. Thank you. Let's go to the next question. The next question comes from William Stein from Truist. Elon, you started to answer this earlier, but I'd like to ask this question about the AI elements of your business and ask if you could comment on progress around Dojo and Optimus and your anticipation for the likelihood, for example, for the company to disconnect the GPU cluster in favor of Dojo and to have some market achievement in Optimus. Yes. I mean, obviously, with -- because we're still at the early stages, there are big [ error pause ] in any predictions. It's like easy -- I think easy to predict long term but hard to predict the time in between now and then. But it's -- we think Dojo will be competitive with the NVIDIA H1 at the end of this year and then hopefully surpass it next year. And the key there is, I think, what's the energy usage required for a given amount of -- if you're training a frame of video, how -- what's the energy cost required to do that training?  And we think probably -- we said this already actually at AI Day 2, so it's not new information, but we do see potential for an order of magnitude improvement relative to GPU, what GPUs can do for Dojo, which is obviously very specialized for AI training. It's hyper-specialized for AI training. It's not -- wouldn't be great for other things, but it should be extremely good for AI training.  So just like if you do an ASIC or something, it's going to be better than a CPU. This is sort of, in some ways, like a giant ASIC. And we're able to -- since we're operating one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world already, the -- we've got a good sense of how efficient the GPU clusters operate and what Dojo needs to do in order to be competitive. But we think that it does have a fundamental architectural advantage because it's designed not to be -- the GPU is trying to do many things for many people. It's trying to do graphics, video games. It's doing crypto mining. It's doing a lot of things.  Dojo is just doing 1 thing, and that is training. And we're also optimizing the low-level software. So it -- at a very sort of fair amount of level. So it's just insanely good at efficient training. And the intercommunication between the Dojo modules is extremely high. It's not going across an Ethernet cable. It's -- so anyway, the -- we see a path to an order of magnitude improvement in the energy efficiency or given unit of training. But we also have to achieve that. And so when will it be achieved? It's hard to say, but we do see a path to get there.  And then also on inference, like once you've got something trained, well, if you want to have a product that's a consequence of that training, that product may not be anything to do with cars, then the efficiency of inference is extremely important. And we also have, by far, the most efficient inference computer in -- at the -- with the FSD computer in the car. This has potential for products that aren't even really in automotive. Thank you. And William, do you have a follow-up? Yes. It sounds like the 1.8 million units you expect this year is supply, not demand-limited supply, it sounds like, by the lithium batteries. If you were to become demand-limited, can you talk to us about your propensity to use price and your relatively high industry margins to grow units and share? Yes. To be clear, the 1.8 million is not cell supply-limited. And yes, I mean we did address that number earlier in the call. Elon, do you want to answer? Yes. It's roughly -- cell supply is roughly matched with that. And the 1.8 million cars, if we get lucky, it could be more. And then the rest would go into stationary storage, the Powerwall and Megapack. So yes. Okay. Let's have the final question from Adam Jonas. Elon, first question is, is it time for Tesla to significantly expand the captive finco? I mean you only have like $4.5 billion of receivables. It's basically nothing compared to other big auto companies. And then I have a follow-up. Zach maybe is best to answer that. Yes. I mean the way that we've been using captive financing so far is to plug what we believe to be gaps in the market of existing third-party products. And so we have a couple of offerings in Europe. We do loans for our energy business, retail energy business here in the U.S. We do leasing and we do a small amount of U.S. loans that are very targeted. And so we're using captives to support market caps, as I mentioned. So basically, it's a vehicle to support vehicle sales, make sure customers have access. I do think there's opportunity here to continue to grow this. We are growing it slowly here. It is a consumer of cash, so we're being cautious on how we do that. But the plumbing is in place to do a lot more here. And I think we'll have to see how things unfold over the course of the year and make decisions real time as to how much we ramp it up versus ramp it back. I think if we see a severe recession this year, which, like I said, hopefully, we don't, in severe recessions, cash is king big time because it's in such short supply. So we want to be cautious about using cash for loans and that sort of thing for cars. I feel we're in a very strong position to get through a recession because we really don't have any debt, and we've got over $20 billion of cash, which is great. The cash is earning a ridiculous return, not a good return, so it's like nontrivial. And the interest rate actually in the $20 billion is earning like quite a good amount.  And I've made this point on Twitter a few times. I'm sure a lot of people on this call understand the fact -- the basic value of a security is a function of the risk-free rate or we'll see how risk-free it really is, but the T-bill rate. So if you've got -- I think the -- if I recall correctly, the S&P 500 has a long-term rate of return of roughly 6%. And so I think the fed needs to be very cautious about having a fed rate that potentially exceeds 6%.  Like if we see deflation, and I think we are seeing deflation, then you would add the deflation number to the \"risk-free rate\" from the fed. And as that starts to exceed 6%, now you're starting to exceed the long-term return of the S&P 500 and starts to become questionable as to why don't just put your money in T bills or savings account essentially instead of in the S&P 500 if the S&P 500 is variable and the bank interest rate is not? This is -- so basically, the fed is at risk of crushing the value of all equities. Quite a serious danger. And just a follow-up. I don't want to steal thunder from March 1 down in Austin, but how close are we to that step-change improvement in BOM cost where you could sell an EV for under $25,000 or $30,000 and actually generate a profit, that kind of real moving assembly line moment in manufacturing? Again, I don't want to steal the thunder, but just if you wanted to kind of wrap up with thoughts there, that would be helpful. I mean I'd love to answer -- I'll probably be asking the same question, but we would be jumping the gun on future announcements. Fantastic. Thank you very much, everyone, for all your good questions, and we will see you again in 3 months' time. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye."

         "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ServiceNow Q4 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I'll turn things over to Darren Yip, Vice President, Investor Relations. Darren, please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining ServiceNow's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me are Bill McDermott, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer; and CJ Desai, our President and Chief Operating Officer.   During today's call, we will review our fourth quarter 2022 results and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, such as our guidance, is based on information as of today and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. We undertake no duty or obligation to update such statements as a result of new information or future events.   Please refer to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and 2021 10-K for factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, all financial measures and related growth rates we discuss today are non-GAAP, except for revenue, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, current RPO and cash and investments.   To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP measures, please refer to today's earnings press release and investor presentation, which are both posted on our website at servicenow.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill? Thank you, Darren, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. ServiceNow continues to perform as-the-beyond expectations company. For Q4, we beat guidance with subscription revenue growth of 27.5% in constant currency. Operating margin was 28%, 2 points above our guidance. Our free cash flow margin was 30%, 1 point above our guidance. We had 126 deals greater than $1 million in Q4, including our largest deals ever worldwide in EMEA and in Latin America. Our 98% renewal rate remains the industry benchmark. With 25.5% constant currency cRPO growth, we actually had better-than-expected new business in Q4 with less reliance on early renewals.  Based on this new business surge, we are giving a very strong guidance for 2023. Our guidance reflects a disciplined forecast that appropriately balances our well-founded optimism for ServiceNow's business. We'll work hard to go beyond it, and we'll begin that march in Q1.   Here is the main takeaway. Even in a complex operating environment, ServiceNow is executing at the rule of 58.5. We are driving net new innovation, fast growth and operating leverage. ServiceNow is the proverbial safe harbor in all weather conditions.   Let me unpack the current environment for you. The secular tailwinds of digital transformation aren't going anywhere. IDC's research makes it clear that technology budgets are growing. They forecast IT spend will grow 5% in 2023, software spend at 8% and Software-as-a-Service spend at 15%. So as businesses increase spend, the only question then is where will all that investment go? And this answer has everything to do with the great reprioritization.  The theme in Davos this year was cooperation in a fragmented world. It all begins with a fragmented enterprise. C-level buyers don't want long-term road maps to clean up a siloed mess of point solutions. They want integration, speed, automation, great experiences and business impact. A CEO told me, \"We can't afford 1,000 points of dim light. We need a cohesive plan with a trusted platform.\" So this is now without any doubt, a platform economy. And only a few platforms will be relevant in this shift, and none are as well positioned at ServiceNow.   This begins with our business model. ServiceNow was born in the cloud, established itself in IT and expanded from that core. It accelerates with the realities of the multi-cloud world. Many enterprises are struggling to use public cloud capacity that they have already procured into ServiceNow, which directly enables cloud workload migration. We are the control tower for any architecture, public, hybrid or multi-cloud. And with open telemetry, we help business build and monitor cloud-native applications. This all extends to driving automation.  ServiceNow has natively embedded the complete tool set from AI to RPA to process mining in our platform. Now professional developers and the rest of us, real people like you and me, can build mission-critical applications to automate the world of work. Everything culminates with real business outcomes.   ServiceNow integrates the enterprise to deliver better customer service, employee experiences, security, risk management and next-generation business processes like procure-to-pay, technology foundation, hyperautomation, process orchestration. With this completeness of vision, ServiceNow is the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. If all we did was help existing customers consume everything this platform can do, we would stay a fast-growing company. But of course, our strategy goes well beyond this as does our proven ability to execute.   Right now, many fine technology companies are working to shift resources from bad businesses to good ones. ServiceNow only has good businesses. Our products and engineering team is building organic net new innovation with an unmatched level of speed and quality. When we started to sense noise in the macro early in 2022, we shifted immediately to a conservative cost management posture in running the company. This allowed us to focus on execution with our team rather than look to workforce actions to leverage. It also allowed us to continue hiring, especially in engineering and quota-carrying roles. The results tell the story.  ITSM was in 14 of our top 20 deals, with 15 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 16 of the top 20, with 14 deals over $1 million. Security and Risk Solutions were in 13 of the top 20, with 9 deals over $1 million. Customer Workflows were in 13 of the top 20, with 13 deals over $1 million. Employee Workflows were in 13 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million. And Creator Workflows were in 19 of the top 20, with 11 deals over $1 million.   We saw new business growth, new logos and major expansions with some of our existing customers. The United States Army expanded its ServiceNow road map to go well beyond IT. ServiceNow will improve the Army's ability to consolidate service management for its over 1 million active military contractor and civilian population. The Schwarz Group, one of the world's top retailers will digitize its 11,000 stores from retail locations to logistics on ServiceNow as its digital business platform. This transition is a transformation and it will position to Schwarz Group at the forefront of the next-generation retail industry.  From Banco do Brasil, to AT&T, to Sumitomo, we have countless stories that span ServiceNow's workflows, Lightstep, geographic regions and industries across the board, we're winning. And as you'll hear from Gina, we grew new business 100% year-over-year across retail, hospitality, transportation and logistics. That's only one example. And with the expansion of ServiceNow's impact, we are setting the standard for speed of deployment and business value for our customers.   More than 3 years ago, I stated our ambition to be the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. And this is an ambition I will see through to its full completion. Following my elevation to Chairman and CEO, I'm delighted to announce that CJ Desai has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer. CJ is the leader of consequence, well-known in the industry. His track record in ServiceNow speaks for itself from strengthening our platform to driving our customer experience. This is exactly how we are orchestrating our company to perform on an end-to-end basis from innovation to execution with our customers. And I'd like to personally congratulate CJ for his latest well-deserved endorsement of his leadership. Congratulations, CJ.   In other news, we proudly welcome Masatoshi Suzuki as the new President of ServiceNow Japan. He brings a long history of successful leadership with some of the industries most respected brands. We will elevate ServiceNow Japan to a fourth geographic region reporting directly to our proven Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Smith. And to add fuel to the growth fire, we rolled out a new partner program to help our ecosystem drive full platform adoption of ServiceNow. We're also getting an enthusiastic reception for the company's premier global initiative, RiseUp with ServiceNow. And under the thoughtful leadership of Lara Caimi, we will continue to rise up. We offer the training and certification to help people build a lifelong career working on this platform. We have never seen so much interest in the ServiceNow franchise around the world as we are seeing right now.   And from an ongoing operating perspective, we entered 2023 with much stronger sales coverage on a year-over-year basis. We have the feet on the street. We also see stronger pipeline coverage and the maturity of that pipeline, much more so than we did a year ago. The latest Glassdoor ratings feature ServiceNow as the 9th best place to work in the United States, 2nd best in the United Kingdom. The company is fully invested in all of our stated ESG objectives with our global impact report coming later this year. All this is a reflection of our proud culture built on Fred Luddy's founding vision for our company.   I was just in Las Vegas last week for our sales kick-off event. And I can tell you, our team is fired up and ready to go for the year ahead. Really fired up. I can only reiterate that we have said consistently, there is only one way forward, and that is innovation. IDC says that by 2027, the number of digital businesses on the S&P 500 would double. Every industry is being reframed by a new paradigm or several. The participants that lean in will lead, the others will fall behind and quickly.  For ServiceNow, we are committed to make the world work better for everyone. Our fundamentals are operating at peak performance, net new innovation for our customers, business impact, driving long-term stickiness of our platform, the network effects, giving us a competitive moat with multiple avenues for market expansion and profitable growth with a pristine balance sheet.  All in all, when people talk about cloud economics, ServiceNow is the blue chip standard. Whatever the world lacks in stability, we will more than offset with relentless execution. Our customers need to automate for cost reduction and to innovate for growth. Yes, ServiceNow helps them do both. The world works with ServiceNow as the end-to-end platform for digital transformation.   I'd like to personally thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their steadfast trust in ServiceNow. You can count on us. We're in your service, we're hungry and humble as ever. I'd like to now hand the call over to our CFO, Gina Mastantuono. Gina, over to you. Thank you, Bill, and happy new year to all of you who are listening in. Q4 was another great quarter of execution. We exceeded our subscription revenue guidance and drove strong renewal and expansion rates. Our operating and free cash flow margins also exceeded our outlook as disciplined cost management drove tailwinds to profitability.   In Q4, subscription revenues were $1.86 billion, growing 27.5% year-over-year in constant currency, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by 50 basis points. RPO ended the year at approximately $14 billion, representing 25% year-over-year constant currency growth. Current RPO was approximately $6.94 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth and a 2-point bp versus our guidance, primarily driven by favorable FX movements in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, growth was 25.5%. While constant currency cRPO growth came in just shy of our guidance of 26%, we actually outperformed our target for net new ACV and renewal ACV for contracts expiring in the quarter. The delta came from fewer early 2023 renewals than is typical in the fourth quarter.    Given our strong renewal rates, which remain the best-in-class 98% in Q4, this is only a timing issue. We expect these customers to ultimately renew upon contract expirations, providing opportunities to drive further expansion throughout 2023. The timing of early renewals does not impact 2023 subscription revenue growth, only RPO. Net new ACV would drive incremental revenue growth, and there, we exceeded our forecast. Our larger-than-average Q4 customer cohort not only renewed at a very strong rate, net expansion also remained robust. What's more, the strength in net new ACV wasn't limited to existing customers. New customer net new ACV grew over 30%.  We ended the quarter with 1,637 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 22% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail and hospitality and transportation and logistics saw net new ACV growth of well over 100% year-over-year. Government remained strong, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Manufacturing and financial services also saw healthy double-digit growth. We closed 126 deals greater than $1 million in net new ACV in the quarter, including 2 of our top 5 largest ever. In addition, we saw 100% increases in the number of both $5 million plus and $10 million-plus net new ACV deals. More and more customers are seeing the true power of the ServiceNow portfolio as a unified platform. That's leading to more multiproduct deals in Q4, 5 of our top 10 deals contain 10 or more products.  Turning to profitability. Operating margin was 28%, 200 basis points above our guidance, driven by disciplined spend management and less-than-expected FX headwinds. Our free cash flow margin was 53%, up 650 basis points year-over-year. For full year 2022, operating margin was 26%, 100 basis points above our guidance and free cash flow margin was 30%, also 100 basis points above our guidance. Total free cash flow for 2022 was a robust $2.2 billion. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet, including $6.4 billion in cash and investments. Together, these results continue to demonstrate our ability to drive a strong balance of world-class growth and profitability.  Before I move to guidance, I want to give a brief update on the trends we are seeing. Heading into 2023, we believe we have prudently factored in the evolving macro crosswinds into our guidance. Overall, the demand environment remains healthy, deals are getting done, the market opportunity is growing, the ecosystem is expanding, our renewal and net expansion rates ended the year strong, our pipeline is robust.  With that in mind, let's turn to our 2023 outlook. We expect subscription revenues between $8.44 billion and $8.5 billion, representing 22.5% to 23.5% year-over-year growth on both a reported and constant currency basis. We expect subscription gross margin of 84%, reflecting the expected diminishing impact of the change in useful life of our data center equipment as well as investments to accelerate customer time to value as part of our impact offering and higher inflation. We expect operating margin of 26% as sales and marketing efficiencies are offsetting headwinds from gross margins. We expect free cash flow margin of 30%. And we expect GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 206 million.  For Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.99 billion and $2 billion, representing 25% to 25.5% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 300 basis point FX headwind. We expect cRPO growth of 24% on a constant currency basis, excluding 300 basis points of FX headwind. We expect an operating margin of 24%, and we expect 204 million GAAP diluted weighted average outstanding shares for the quarter.  In conclusion, we had a strong Q4, capping a resilient year. As we enter 2023, the macro challenges many enterprises face underscore a point we have made consistently. The technology strategy has become the business strategy. Digital technologies are growth-stimulating deflationary force. They power new business models, accelerating productivity while reducing costs. Our unique ability to drive business model transformation while delivering efficiency gains has created durable demand for the Now Platform. Our investment strategy is a laser focus on our customers' most pressing issues, and that continuous net new innovation translates into net new business for ServiceNow. We are well positioned for 2023 and remain on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century.  Finally, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance this year. Bill and I can't thank our employees enough for their continued hard work and dedication. With that, I'll open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this afternoon from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Congratulations, everybody. Bill, we continue to hear from some of your largest partners of the great opportunity ahead in the middle office for which ServiceNow platform just seems to be ideally suited. How are customers prioritizing these opportunities right now and into this year? And how do you position yourselves particularly with partners and vertical industry solutions to best capture it? And I've got a follow-up for Gina. Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. And before I answer the first question, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to officially welcome CJ Desai as our newly minted President and COO, who is joining me here today, and I will have him continue to join me on these calls. And I'd also like to acknowledge Gina for powering through while she's a bit under the weather, so please her voice might be a little scratchy, but her passion is on fire. So she's in good shape, but losing her voice a little bit. We've been all over the world from Davos to Vegas to here. So that's what happens when you travel a little bit.  Brad, the partners and the largest partners are really doubling down on their investment with ServiceNow. And I look at it as a multifaceted situation. First, on this RiseUp with ServiceNow, we're going to train 1 million people in the ecosystem to be fully certified on the platform to ensure that we globally scale. Second, partners are teaming up with us on an industry domain basis also based on persona and mapping that back to our solution road map and naturally, everybody is all in on the platform. So the big ones are really doubling down on the platform. What's interesting, and you bring up a good point, this is for the front, the mid and the back office. And there's a next-generation ERP evolving here with things like procure-to-pay, optimizing supply chains and other things that definitely impact the middle office. But I would also say we have a great opportunity. And if you saw our new business surge in Q4, you're seeing it play out, where we're going to net new logos and drawing net new business. And I think that will be a big part of it. CJ, you may want to build on it from what you're seeing in the middle office. Brad, here is what I would say, when we look at the engagement layer, engagement layer has been around for a long time, say, for a customer service request. So for a large financial services organization, moving the workflow from the engagement layer on, say, a customer complain to the mid-office where we really shine because of our interoperability of the platform and our ability to integrate the systems and to different clouds all the way to the back office. And that's what is driving the middle office acceleration, whether that's for a financial services organization, telecommunications or a health care organization. Excellent. And I know, Brad, you have the second question, I think, for Gina. Congrats. I was remiss in not congratulating you, CJ. For you Gina, I appreciate the additional disclosure on net new ACV. You guys clearly had a really strong quarter for new business, which is what matters most to investors. But as we think about cRPO and what you shared with us, I mean, we're all trying to understand the customer mindset during these uncertain times. Is it fair to conclude that perhaps there was less of a traditional Q4 IT budget flush in 2023? And if not, what else would be the rationale as to why you would see that phenomenon? Yes, of course, Brad. Thanks for the question, and apologies for my throat. So I think what you're seeing is early renewals were always correlated and still always correlated to net new ACV. And when people early renew, it's really about co-terming multiple contracts. And certainly, in the current environment, I don't know if you want to say it's less budget flush or just more tightening of budgets, the need or the desire to co-term the contract is a little bit less than what we've seen historically, not altogether surprising given the current macro. It's why I wanted to be really clear about the fact that early renewals have no impact on future revenue, right? And in the quarter, our target forecast for net new ACV as well as renewal ACV within the quarter actually overachieved, which is why we were able to come out with a strong 2023 revenue guide and why we feel good about not only the Q4 results, but also the position that we stand in the market as well entering 2023. Excellent. And thank you for the very important disclosure on net new ACV. We go next now to Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Congrats from me as well. A quick question. If you think about the different pockets of growth, you saw this quarter that the HR and CRM part was a little bit stronger for Q4. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers? Because like ITSM, ITOM, you're kind of the #1 player. And the other ones you're expanding. So it's nice to see the expansion in them. And then I had one follow-up for Gina. Yes, I'll make the first point, Raimo. And then I think CJ can actually even give you some customer examples that might be helpful. We have become the platform for digital transformation, and that's an end-to-end platform for digital transformation. So what you're seeing now is a company that has evolved from IT to the employee experience to customer service management. And now obviously, the low-code platform and how the Creator Workflow is exploding is demonstrated in our outstanding results and our very strong guide. So we're really now a platform company with a multiproduct approach to helping every customer in the industry they operate in, based on the persona we're discussing business with and ultimately, it's that completeness of vision now that has made us one of -- about a handful of companies in the entire world that really matter in the enterprise. CJ, you've got some examples you want to talk about? Absolutely. So employee experience and employee productivity are two sides of the same coin. And with our HR service delivery product that is resonating really well, whether it's in commercial markets, including we had a very strong public sector performance as Gina outlined, where that product is resonating. And during this macroeconomic times, when you think about customer service, you want to hold on to your customers and you want to serve them profitability. That's what is driving business for our customer service management product. So we are seeing that despite the technology foundation where IT is the business, digital services other business which is what driving our ITSM and ITOM product lines and what we call service operations, picking the best of service management and operations management, but HR and our customer service management are also driving growth in very specific industries from telco to public sector and health care. Okay. That was very clear. And then the -- Gina one for you quickly, on the margin and cash flow outperformance. Can you talk a little bit about factors that we should consider in terms of timing, et cetera, that might have impacted this more, will we kind of don't want to extrapolate into next year, et cetera. Yes. It's a great question, Raimo. So I gave a good strong guide for operating margin as well as free cash flow margin for 2023. I think what you saw in Q4 from an operating margin perspective was continued discipline on the cost side, as you have seen us do and as you will consistently see us do. On the free cash flow side, obviously, that disciplined cost management flows through. But also, we did see some CapEx spend come through towards the tail end of Q4, which means that the payments are not due until Q1 of '23. So that does drive a little bit of headwind on the free cash flow margin in '23, which is why you see the guide that I gave. Hopefully, that's helpful. We go next now to Sterling Auty at SVB. Just want to circle back on the cRPO. Given the constant currency was 25.5%, is more of the issue that you described more happening internationally than in the U.S.? And how should we think about kind of the appetite to do renewals? And is there any concern about expansions from some of those international customers here in the first part of '23? Yes. Surely, it has nothing to do with the renewal dynamics internationally versus domestic. The difference between the constant currency growth and nominal growth really just has to do with FX rates that moved within the quarter. So no real differences internationally versus the Americas on the renewal side of things. With respect to the early renewals, what I would point to is the strong net new ACV growth in Q4 tells you. And by the way, very strong expansion rate in Q4 tells you that customers are not changing their behaviors with respect to renewals, on-time renewals or with net new expansion. What you're just seeing is a little bit of the lack of meeting to do co-terms and bring things forward in the current macro. Again, with 98% renewal rates across the board, we remain as positive as ever that not only will we continue to expand in '23, as you've seen us do in '22, but also continue to renew at those best-in-class renewal rates. We'll go next now to Karl Keirstead at UBS. Sorry for asking. You have to use your voice again. But how are you feeling about the 2024 targets? I think the consensus to you is that the $11 billion might be a little bit of a stretch given that you've had to absorb a pretty heavy FX headwind. The operating margin target of 27% seems doable. But when I look at your free cash flow target of 33%, that would be a 300 bps improvement in calendar '25. So that one feels like a little bit of a push. Do you mind just commenting on those targets? Much appreciated. Yes. Great question, Karl. What I would say is, overall, the underlying growth that we're seeing remains healthy. FX headwinds have eased slightly, but certainly are still material. And with the uncertain macro backdrop, we're going to continue to monitor the market and provide an update on our long-term targets at our Analyst Day in May. So I'd say, again, underlying demand, really strong; operating margin, well on the trajectory to hit 27%; with respect to top line and free cash flow, with the impact of FX, and that keeps moving along, we'll update those targets for you in May. But let's go back to what Bill talked about earlier. We remain very well positioned given the current macro environment. We are the platform of choice for digital transformation. And that opportunity has not changed. If anything, it continues to grow. We'll hear next now from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Bill, just given your comments on the pipeline coverage and also the maturity, would you say that the macro headwinds have actually dissipated somewhat if you compare it back to the summer? Or are those winds still blowing fairly steadily, but you're just able to kind of navigate through them through will power and execution rigor? Yes, Mark, thank you very much for the question. I did call it out. I think maybe we were the first ones to call it out but there were some clouds on the horizon back then with the macro, and we all know the forces that were blowing between Ukraine, inflation, tightening monetary policies, supply chain dislocation, and everyone sees that to a halt so we don't need to go there. I think what happened back then is most businesses were not ready for that market. And we immediately revamped our go-to-market in the way we approached the customer because we knew the customer would have to do more with less, automate their business, take cost out and improve productivity per person. And the work wasn't going to go away. It still had to be done, and step ServiceNow's platform.  And then we also knew at the same time that CEOs, 98% of them, this is a fact have a digital-first strategy. Worried about the other 2%, but I'm good with the 98% because that makes a lot of sense. And we also knew that they weren't going to give up on their digital business dreams and they would be investing to reorient business models, as Gina said and think differently about their enterprise, which CJ's example underscored and growth would still remain on the agenda. It's just a question of what equilibrium between growth and cost takeout would be necessary for them to achieve their goals.  The good thing is, with ServiceNow's platform, you could say yes to both. And you don't have to make that choice. So what I see in the market, I see commodity tech that was at the peak of the hype cycle during the pandemic being dialed down or eliminated. And I see that investment freeing up to platforms that actually matter.  So I do think our circumstances are actually improving because of this particular macro, because it's well-known now that ServiceNow can take the cost down, if that's what you need immediately. And given the layoffs that we're seeing and the stories that we're reading, I clearly see that our company is rising accordingly. And I see that in the pipeline. I see that in the maturity of the pipeline which is a really important fact.  And this year, we came in with sales productivity at least 20% better than I had at the start of last year based on the feet on the street and the readiness of those feet because they've been well trained and certified to do their job. All these forces are coming together in a way that gives me a feeling the market will be on our side, but our executional excellence will never have to rely on the weather conditions. We're ready. Very clear. And Gina, sorry again, given your voice. But just again, on the topic of the lower mix of early renewals from 2023, should we interpret it at all as customers may be a little hesitant to renew early just because of the cost of capital is higher, they want to hang on to cash a little longer? Or on the flip side, is there some element of maybe you actually enjoyed the luxury of not having to encourage as many early renewals because you did see so much strength on the new logo side? A great point, Mark. And certainly, I think you're seeing a little bit of both. And what I keep telling folks is the fact that we are not having to rely on early renewals as much as we've done in the past, shows the resilience and the strength and the power of the Now Platform. But yes, I also think that in this market, people are holding on to cash a little bit longer. And that's not altogether surprising either. And Mark, one thing I would just build on what Gina is saying, and for every investor out there, when you don't need to rely on early renewals, that means you have a competitive advantage with your technology. It also means that you're able to preserve your pricing power as you go into the renewal cycles on their normal terms. So this is actually a super healthy thing, and that's why the guide for 2023 was above all the consensus estimates that you guys have. The next is from Kash Rangan at Goldman Sachs. I would think that in a time of inflationary environments that people would want to get rid of cash and preserve the purchasing power. But anyways, a little counterintuitive. That was not my question anyway. So congratulations, first of all, Bill, CJ. And Gina, I will spare you. I'll give you some time off and not ask you a question, so you can rest your voice.  Bill, one thing that occurs to me is that you've scaled a very successful technology company before. So what are the patterns that you see at this point of the evolution of ServiceNow, there could be so many things that you could be doing differently, from a go-to-market perspective, verticalizing the product, expanded distribution partnerships with resellers potentially. There's so much innovation. I look at the number of products that you have, it's mind blowing.  Almost complex. How do you ensure that this all does not get in the way of your mission to build the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century? How do you make these catalysts and tailwinds and ensure that nothing gets in the way since you've especially seen this pattern play out and you've successfully done this before? Yes, absolutely. Yes, Kash, as I said, we've been through this movie before, and I'd like to show. So here's the situation. We're keeping it real simple for 22,000 of our closest friends within ServiceNow and for our partners. We have the end-to-end platform for digital transformation. That platform is applicable to each industry and every persona within the enterprise. And we are going to expand that across the world. And you saw the move we made with Japan, our ambitions are going to India, to the Middle East and many other places.  So end-to-end platform, by industry, persona and geo, and we kept it very simple for our colleagues and also our partners. We focused on net new innovation. We will build the future. We have the best engineering leader and the best engineering team in the industry, hard stop. We have an incredible go-to-market machine, and we are betting on ourselves. So we're going to keep a real simple around net new innovation and net new ACV. That's it. And with a loyal customer base that will remain ever loyal with many upsells, cross-sells and same-account revenue growth. If you get new business on top of that because you're building the best product in the world, you're going to have the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. We go next now to Peter Weed at Bernstein. Congratulations on the performance, particularly on the net new ACV. In fact, that's what I'd love to help -- a little bit of help unpacking that because obviously, it's including both new logos and expansion. And I think we heard last quarter and correct me if I'm wrong, that new customer acquisition had slowed relative to, say, Q2 where I think for new revenue, you had talked about maybe 10% of growth was coming from new customers. When you look forward now and looking forward to next year and the revenue growth, are you seeing most of that growth coming from existing customers relative to what you would have normally done with new customers, I guess, is part of the question. And then the other side of the question is it appears that NRR declined by about 300 basis points quarter-over-quarter and in your guide, it would anticipate continuing decline in NRR by probably another 300 basis points to hit your guide. What is really creating that weakness in the kind of the renewal NRR relative to recent quarters that have been pretty consistently at or above 130%? Peter, I'll take the first question. So clearly, we're thrilled with the net new ACV growth that we're seeing, and not only our expansion rates strong within the quarter and for the full year in 2022, we were really, really pleased to see that new customer, net new ACV grew over 30% year-over-year despite the headwinds. And we've talked about this in the past. We've really evolved our focus away from the number and the volume of new customers to landing the right new customers that can land with us and expand with us over time. And so the fact that these new lands are growing is testament to the platform and testament to the breadth of products on the platform.  And so as we think about 2023 and beyond, we absolutely expect to continue to see very strong expansion rates as well as good new logo growth. But again, it's about not the volume of those new logos, but the quality. And really, you can see that in our results. With respect to your comment on NRR declining by 300 basis points, that's not what we're seeing. I'm not sure what math you're doing, but I'm sure that off-line, Darren can talk you through it. But our net retention rate and expansion rate remains very strong in Q4 and for the whole year in 2022. We go next to now to Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley. And very nice end to the year with that new business growth there. Gina, I wanted to dig in on gross margins a little bit. I'm still trying to wrap my head around a 200 basis point decline. We haven't seen 84% subscription gross margins in ServiceNow since 2016, if I'm looking on my model correctly. I believe you told us last year at this time that there's still an incremental 50 basis points of tailwind that you can get from the accounting change on useful life. So there's somewhere a 250 basis point offset that's driving down gross margins. Can you help us understand what that is, a little bit better? What's that added expense that had such a weight on gross margin heading into FY '23? Yes. Great question, Keith. So first of all, your math is a little off, right? So we had in 2021, we had 85% gross margin, and then this year, 86%. And we talked about that 100 basis points being the change in depreciation life of our assets. And we've said that 100 basis points was going to come down to 50, right? So you take 86, you come off to 50, that gives you 85.5. And so what you're seeing, what I tried to call out in my script is, number one, we are seeing impacts of inflation, right, not surprising, and we've talked about. But also, we are also investing heavily in ensuring that our customers are getting to success in getting to implementation much faster with respect to our impact products. And so very conscious investment decisions being made there, offset by sales and marketing efficiencies that you've come to expect from us, which is why the operating margin guide remains absolutely where you would have expected to be because we're making investments in cost of sales to get our customers to implementation as a value faster, offset by the sales and marketing efficiencies. We'll take our next question now from Alex Zukin at Wolfe Research. Congrats, CJ. Congrats guys on a solid quarter. I guess, we're all trying to unpack, I think, 2 metrics that would be very, very helpful from the quarter itself. So apologies for the more financial-oriented question. But Gina, can you quantify the renewal headwind from the smaller early renewals? And can you comment on the net retention rate itself? Was it still 125 for the full year? Because when you take a step back, it looks like the cRPO guide for Q1 is a lot stronger than where people thought it would be, which implies that maybe that renewal headwind becomes a tailwind if you get those renewals or maybe you've got them already in the quarter. And the guide for the full year, to your point, is I think, a lot stronger than what people realize. So we're all trying to kind of piece together that -- those 2 dynamics and questions. I won't quantify the exact renewal headwind. But what I would say is that if not for the early renewals, we would have beat our cRPO guide. And with respect to the NRR, while we don't comment on exact numbers, it was absolutely consistent and relatively close to the 125 that you quote. Perfect. Super helpful. And I guess maybe a technical one or a product-oriented one for you, Bill or CJ. With respect to some of the other new areas of innovation that you're bringing to bear, particularly in industries going forward. Can you maybe highlight some early anecdotes and examples of kind of some of the larger customer wins and verticals that give you confidence to kind of pour gas on the fire there? Absolutely. So great to hear from you, Alex. I would say one of the products that we verticalized pretty early on was in the telco, media and tech back in -- started building that in 2019, seeing very strong traction, everything from order management to mid-office to back office in telcos. And that product line which was created for that industry is now at top 10 telcos and continue to win market share and displace multiple systems, whether it's a telco company or a media company.  Similarly, the public sector, we created a product for public sector as well as health care that is seeing strong traction as well. And overall, between the new products, horizontal products like we have done in the world of ERP on procure-to-pay or supplier life cycle management, combined that with some of these new industry products, we are winning 7-figure deals, sometimes much larger and having massive traction in that specific where customers are actually going live in 3 to 4 months. Thank you, Alex. By the way, CJ had one go live yesterday with 50,000 agents, and we were in the board room together as we were watching the go live and it was flawless. So that's a customer service management example for one of the most prestigious brands in the world. So you can count on our customer service management business to continue to rock the house. So we're ready to go. And by the way, don't get caught up in the cRPO thing because it's only a forecasting based on prior year assumptions, has nothing to do with what actually happened. The net new business was fantastic. And all those renewals are sitting for us in 2023. And obviously, because we're delivering business value and impact, it is sitting there for us at the right pricing structure. So it's actually a super good thing from a shareholder value creation perspective. We can go next now to Brad Reback at Stifel. Bill, last week, you spoke pretty adamantly about continuing to hire. Hiring net new downtick a little bit here in 4Q versus the previous few quarters. Maybe you can give us an idea of what the plan is for this year. Yes. Thank you very much, Brad. As Gina said, we're going to be very intentional about how we manage the head count in the corporation. We are protecting this house as a primary objective. And we have invested very heavily, as you know, for the last 3.5 years, for sure, on head count. And we have what we need. Where we are investing, and we'll continue to invest, primarily will be coders, people that actually write the code and also people that are actually responsible for the customer relationship and carry a quota. So we're going to be very, very intentional. And I'm really super excited because we're in great shape on our workforce.  We have really happy workforce. Our retention rates are better than ever. The Glassdoor ranking speaks to some of that. So what we are finding is because of our intentionality, we're getting 9s and 10s in here, and the people we are choosing to hire come from a pool of thousands and thousands and only the best get to go to ServiceNow. And I think that's going to build an even stronger ServiceNow going forward. So no problem with the workforce. Everything is about driving innovation or net new ACV, net new innovation, net new ACV. That's the ball game. If I could just add, we're entering 2023, and Bill alluded to this earlier, we're entering 2023 with significantly more ramp reps than we entered into '22. So that growth. Yes, we might have had a little bit of a slowdown in hiring in Q4, but that was not on quota-bearing sales or engineering. We're entering 2023 from a ramp reps perspective, very strong, which gives us confidence not only with the pipeline we're seeing, but with the productivity that we'll get out of those ramp reps. We'll take our next question now from Keith Bachman of BMO. Gina, I hope you feel better. A question and a clarification. First, a clarification. Gina, it was an impressive metric you provided on the net new customer ACV growth of 30%. Can you just -- for context, can you give us what that same number would have been last year in the December quarter or an average over the last 2 years in the December quarter? I'm just trying to see what the calibration point is. And then my question, it relates to the upsell. And in particular, on ITOMs and ITSM, in the past, you provided updates on kind of the SKU mix, in other words, going to Pro to Enterprise. If you could just give us an update on -- is that slowing up at all given the economy or are customers kind of forging ahead and just where are -- if you could give us an update on the transition? That's it for me. Yes, Keith, I'll tell you that 30% net new ACV -- net new customer ACV growth, we're really proud of in the quarter -- we haven't given those metrics in prior quarters. Suffice it to say that we continue to see those net new customer ACVs growing as we are landing larger deals with new customers. And those new customers are able to expand with us more. So really strong growth in the quarter, but we've not consistently given that, but suffice it to say that we are continuing to see that grow. With respect to ITSM Pro, we've talked about penetration being at about 35%, and that continues to do well. And so does that continue to move higher, Gina, through the year? Or is that kind of -- is there any pressure on that stalling out at all in terms of customers willing to mix up? It has continued to grow. We don't give that percentage every single quarter. We'll give it every time it hits the next five if that makes sense. But we absolutely are seeing Pro penetration continuing. CJ, I don't know if you want to add anything... Absolutely, Keith. Here is what I can say. So the number continues to increase since we launched this in 2018. And what was super encouraging in Q4 was that some of the new logos that we got with ITSM also landed with ITSM Pro besides our existing cohort upgrading to ITSM Pro. So 35%, we are currently very, very optimistic. And at Financial Analyst Day, we will provide bigger updates on what's happening with ITSM Pro and Enterprise. We'll go next now to Tyler Radke at Citi. Maybe for Bill or CJ, just given the widespread conversations around cloud optimizations as we heard from Microsoft last night, can you just talk about how you're approaching these conversations with your customers? Are there specific products that you're leading with? And then CJ, just I would love to get an update on your view on the ServiceNow observability strategy heading into 2023. Kind of what are your key milestones from a product perspective? And how is just the progress gone since the most recent acquisition? Absolutely. So let's first start with the cloud optimization question. Listen, our product line since day 1, whether you look at ITSM, ITOM or asset management, our ability to discover assets whether they are an on-prem cloud, private cloud, public cloud or multi-cloud has continued to be best-in-class. So we help our customer, they're trying to optimize their power spend. That's great. If they're trying to move to public cloud and they want to accelerate that journey, that's great too. So our portfolio is best suited for meeting our customers where they are on that cloud journey and where they want to go. So I feel actually pretty good in terms of just our portfolio's relevance in this multi-cloud states. And how our different product lines can help them with their acceleration and optimization.  And on observability, what was really encouraging for me in Q4 is that we had 3 of Fortune 100 companies decided to buy ServiceNow observability solution and Lightstep at a meaningful scale. And these are real workloads that are really being monitored by our Lightstep solution. And as I think about 2023 milestones, as you know, Tyler, we bought company called Era, which provides log management solution. We will fully integrate that in our observability platform. So we have not only primary observability solution, but also unified observability solutions that work across multi-states. So very optimistic going into '23. We do have time for one more question this afternoon. We'll take that now from Sarah Bowler at Macquarie Capital. Congrats to CJ, wonderful to see. Really, I think just given that you're operating in this, what feels like rarefied air, let me sort of flip things over a little bit and ask if there were any verticals that you haven't called out or regions in particular where you saw any softness or perhaps extra layers of scrutiny on overall spending? So I will say -- I'm going to take this, Sarah. Thank you very much. But overall, we feel very balanced performance. Gina called out certain verticals super proud of what we did in public sector. Typically, in Q3, we are expected to do well in public sector. But even in Q4, we did really well and as Gina called out 50% growth. So whether it's public sector, whether it's retail, whether it's health care and others, very balanced performance and strong growth, an amazing quarter. I would say, as Bill just touched on, we are really excited about our growth potential in Japan and India. And with new appointment in Japan and Japan being the core geography according to Paul Smith, Chief Commercial Officer, is somewhere we really want to pay attention to, and we are very optimistic on the market side there. And again, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you all for joining today's ServiceNow Q4 2022 earnings conference call. Again, that will bring us to the end of today's call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great afternoon. Goodbye."

         "Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Mastercard Incorporated Q4 and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Warren Kneeshaw, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, we'll open up the call for the Q&A session. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning. Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach. Thank you, Warren. Good morning, everyone. Let's get right into it. So starting with the big picture. Consumer spending has remained resilient, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. We closed out the year with strong financial results and several notable wins. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 17% and adjusted operating income up 19%, both versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis excluding special items. While the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we are keeping a close eye on a variety of positive and negative factors. The broadly resilient labor market with low unemployment and rising wages, coupled with elevated consumer savings levels, are key drivers of consumer spending. We're also tracking efforts by the central banks to curb inflation, along with moderating energy prices and the reopening of China. So still lots of moving pieces. From an overall consumer spending standpoint, we expect the consumer to be relatively resilient. Spending patterns have largely normalized relative to the effects of the pandemic with the notable exception of China. In terms of switched volumes, domestic volumes in the fourth quarter remained steady relative to 2019 levels with some slight moderation in the U.S. related to lower gas prices recently. Cross-border travel continued to recover in quarter 4, with inbound travel either flat or up in every region sequentially relative to 2019 levels. As of the first 3 weeks of January, inbound cross-border travel to all regions is now above 2019 levels. We will continue to monitor the economic environment closely. And should the outlook change, we're prepared to move quickly to adjust our spending levels as we have done in the past.  In the meantime, we continue to focus on the things we can control. That starts with our 3 strategic priorities: expanding payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. And here are some examples of how we're progressing against each of these. Starting with payments. We won substantial new business this quarter. Our innovative products, differentiated services and partnership approach enabled us to secure major portfolio flips, extend relationships and launch new programs with banks, co-brand partners and transit systems around the world. I am very excited about our expanded partnership with Citizens to become their exclusive payments provider across all product portfolios in the United States. They will shift their debit portfolio to Mastercard, and we will maintain exclusivity on credit and commercial. Citizens selected Mastercard based on our digital assets, open banking capabilities and safety and security tools. We have also extended and enhanced our long-term partnership with Citi. It solidifies Mastercard as Citi's exclusive global partner for Citi-branded consumer credit, debit and small business cards. We look forward to continuing to partner to deliver digital initiatives, new technologies and innovative payment solutions together. We've extended our long-standing relationship with Bank of America across their consumer and small business debit and credit lines of business. They're great partners. We're especially proud to continue as the lead brand for all newly issued small business cards. And our positive momentum with Chase continued this quarter as well. Building up on our recent co-brand, commercial and paper bank partnership announcements, we are excited to announce that we have renewed the Chase Freedom Flex portfolio. Turning to the U.K. We recently extended our credit deal with NatWest Group for consumer and commercial. So partnering with [ Belvin ], a stumble transportation to convert over 17 million closed-loop cards, Mastercards and add 24,000 new acceptance locations across the city. We've partnered with QNB Finance Bank and Trendyol, a large e-commerce marketplace in Turkey, over 30 million customers to launch a new Mastercard co-brand credit product. Now an important driver of our success in core payments is our ability to deliver innovation and thought leadership. We are designing and deploying innovation solutions at scale, as a result, are the clear partner of choice for our customers. Three recent examples include our book in installments, tokenization and Click to Pay. Starting off with installments. SoFi launched Pay in 4, becoming the first bank in the U.S. to launch within the Mastercard Installments program. SoFi valued the broad acceptance, strong consumer protections and commission-based open banking capabilities that all make Mastercard Installments unique. We've got a strong pipeline for Mastercard Installments and plan to add several additional programs across multiple regions throughout the year. Turning to tokenization. We surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions per month. And for the year, we are up 38%. We're currently enabling digital transactions in over 110 countries. Tokenization helps keep the ecosystem safe and secure across a wide range of use cases. One example that I think is particularly cool is the work we are doing with in-car payment. We're working with car manufacturers and fintechs to integrate payments using our tokenization platform and biometric authentication capabilities. Think about the simplicity it brings to paying for gas, tolls, charging or entertainment right from your car. This is a great example of Mastercard working with partners to drive the convergence of the Internet of Things, 5G and addressing consumer demand for cool digital experiences. It also highlights how we're expanding the reach and the value of our acceptance network through new channels to support new use cases. This is just the beginning. Watch for more to come in this space. And on Click to Pay, we partnered with Adyen to launch Click to Pay on their global payment platform, recognizing the value that it brings to guest checkouts and millions of online shoppers. Adyen joins more than 20 other payment service providers around the world, bringing Click to Pay to thousands of merchants globally. Now the focus on innovation and partnership is also a critical part of our strategy to penetrate the prioritized set of new flows that we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day. We continue to make solid progress. Here are some of the examples how we're driving growth in each area. First, disbursements and remittances. Mastercard Send and our cross-border services capabilities are solving for an expanding set of use cases across multiple geographies. For example, we partnered with social marketplace platform, Poshmark, to enable seller payouts. And for cross-border payments, we've teamed up with Pay Send to broaden our global reach and expand the ability to send international payments across card brands. Second, we're deploying digital capabilities to displace cash- and check-based commercial payments at the point of sale, huge opportunity. In France, we signed an agreement with Societe General to develop their corporate card book. And in South Korea, we partnered with Kakao Bank and Samsung Cards to launch new debit and credit co-brand offerings for small businesses. The third flow is B2B accounts payable payments. Our virtual card capabilities provide an effective digital solution to address the working capital, process efficiency and data challenges that are prevalent in B2B. We are the global leader in virtual card. We're seeing rapid growth in this space. We're bolstering our position through new partnerships and capabilities. For example, we announced plans to partner with Sabre and Conferma Pay to accelerate the use of virtual cards for B2B travel payments. We also signed an agreement with fintech partner, Extend, to offer virtual mobile corporate cards in the U.S. and Canada. And finally, on the consumer bill payment front, we are focused on deploying market-specific solutions to meet unique needs of consumers and businesses. For example, in Norway, we are powering the eFaktura service, which is used by the vast majority of citizens to pay their bills. In 2022, we hit a milestone as over 200 million digital invoices were sent using eFaktura. As you can see, we're making significant progress expanding in payments, and we are excited about the opportunity in front of us. Now turning to the second of our 3 strategic priorities, services. Services provide differentiation and diversification for Mastercard. Our strategy is to leverage our services to drive growth at the core and to expand into new segments and use cases. We're making steady progress on both and have significant opportunity for future growth. Our services continue to drive growth in the core as evidenced by our wins and extensions with Citizens, Citi, NatWest and others, as I mentioned earlier. One example of a service that enhances the value of payments is Consumer Clarity. The service provides cardholders with merchant details in digital receipts to reduce disputes, low charge-back costs and improve the consumer experience. We recently partnered with TSYS who will offer Consumer Clarity to over 25 million cardholders in the U.S. and the U.K. In 2022, we signed up over 50 financial institutions and merchant partners for Consumer Clarity, including large issuers like Itaú in Brazil. We're also expanding our services to new segments and new use cases, including governments, retailers, digital partners and financial institutions. This quarter, we partnered with research and consulting firms, including [ E4 and Cyma ] in Germany, as well as the Barbados Ministry of Tourism and International Transport to provide governments with detailed insights into tourism and retail spending trends. We engage with retailers like Lowe's who are leveraging our Test & Learn capabilities to conduct analytics on their core business. We partner with large fintechs like Monzo in the U.K. to advise on product development strategies. And we are deploying our personalization solutions, which we acquired through Dynamic Yield across a range of retail and financial institutions, including [ Carrefour ] Argentina, HYPE, [indiscernible] to enhance and scale their personalization efforts. I'm very encouraged by the continued momentum in our services growth strategy and the differentiation and diversification that these capabilities bring. I'll now move on to our third strategic priority, which is embracing new networks, namely open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I'd like to highlight an example of how our open banking capabilities have come together with our other strategic priorities to offer a new solution.  As I mentioned earlier, in quarter 4, JPMorgan Payments and Mastercard announced an innovative Pay by Bank solution. Solution utilizes the MasterCard open banking platform to modernize existing ACH payments and allow customers to pay bills from their bank account in a frictionless manner. Pay by Bank offers choice and provides a simple and secure experience of billers and merchants as well as consumers by enhancing existing ACH transactions. This deal is a manifestation of our multi-rail strategy, expands our addressable market by our open banking capabilities and it deepens our relationship with JPMorgan Chase. We're actively working with them to take the solution to market this year. We also continue to make progress with open banking in Europe. Mastercard is connected to more than 3,000 banks and financial institutions across 18 markets to power their open banking efforts. This quarter, we partnered with Secure Trust Bank in the U.K., who will leverage our open banking capabilities to provide safe and convenient ways for their customers to repay retail loans directly from their bank account. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, aided by a resilient consumer and the continued recovery in cross-border travel. In payments, we won substantial new business this quarter, including Citizens. We're expanding our differentiated services and embracing new networks, including leveraging our open banking capabilities to power solutions like JPMorgan's Pay by Bank. With all that, we're well positioned for the opportunities ahead. We will manage the business with agility should the macroeconomic outlook change. Sachin, over to you. Thanks, Michael. Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 17%, supported by a resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 19%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 16%, which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 19% year-over-year to $2.65, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $590 million through January '23 -- 2023. So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV [indiscernible] by 14%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 14%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel. Debit increased 1%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 8% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 7%. Cross-border volume was up 31% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending. Turning now to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 8% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 18% year-over-year in Q4. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 56% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3.1 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. Now let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by domestic cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 6%, while worldwide gross dollar volume grew 8%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 40%, while cross-border volumes increased 31%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter. Transaction processing fees were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 8%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 16%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our Cyber & Intelligence and Data & Services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 18%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity. Moving on to Page 7. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs. Turning to Page 8. Let's discuss the operating metrics for the first 3 weeks of January compared to Q4 2022. Each of these metrics, with the exception of cross-border card-not-present excluding travel, were favorably impacted by the lapping of the slower growth that occurred in January 2022 related to the Omicron variant. Switched volumes grew 21% year-over-year, up 7 ppt versus Q4. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 4 ppt versus Q4. Overall, cross-border volumes grew 42% year-over-year, up 11 ppt versus Q4, driven by cross-border travel growth of 84% year-over-year, up 25 ppt versus Q4. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, grew 10% year-over-year, up 2 ppt from Q4. A couple of administrative notes for your reference to help you understand the trends in the business ex Russia, we have suspended -- where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from this schedule if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. Additionally, as the impacts of the pandemic recede, going forward, we will no longer provide operating metric levels as a percentage of 2019. Turning now to Page 9. I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. Let me start by saying that I believe that we are well positioned to address the significant growth opportunities at hand. We have established a clear set of strategic priorities and are making steady progress against each of them. This is evidenced by the many wins across the products and services Michael has discussed on this call and over time. On the macroeconomic front, as Michael laid out, we are monitoring a number of both positive and negative factors. We do expect consumer spending to hold up relatively well in this environment driven in part by the strong labor market. It is important to remember that we are coming off a year of strong growth as we lap the effects of the pandemic, and we expect our go-forward growth rates to moderate accordingly. From a cross-border travel standpoint, most regions have recovered and are well above 2019 levels in Q4. The exception is Asia, where there is still room to improve with the China reopening. Just a little further context here. China represented about 1% of inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at approximately 20% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, China represented about 2% of outbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at about 50% of Q4 2019 levels. With this in mind, our base case scenario for the full year 2023 is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022. Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year primarily due to the recent strengthening of the euro relative to U.S. dollar. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue to carefully manage our expenses as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short- and long-term growth. For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind for the year. Turning now to the first quarter. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items and reflects generally resilient consumer spending. A couple of points to note. Q1 will be the last quarter in which we experienced the lapping effect of our decision to suspend operations in Russia in Q1 of 2022. And we expect cross-border volume growth in Q1 2023 to be elevated as a result of the effects of Omicron in Q1 2022. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18% in Q1 and 18% to 18.5% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren. Thank you, Sachin. Audra, we're now ready for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein. So Michael, Sachin, I want to ask about Pay by Bank. Over the years, you've developed and acquired capabilities for Pay by Bank in different countries. You've talked about this new partnership with JPMorgan. But a skeptic could also argue that Pay by Bank is a risk regards longer term, and there's some precedence in certain countries. So can you talk about the push and pull for severe and also maybe touch upon where does Pay by Bank being used versus card? Has Mastercard able to participate in those transactions? Right. Harshita, let me start off on that. So the way we think about this is, in the end, it is about delivering choice to consumers, choice to merchants, choice to banks, and we are therefore in all relevant ways to pay. But it's also true that the card ecosystem over the years has driven tremendous value. So it is a prevalent way to pay for many, many use cases. But on the side, we have alternative payment methods emerging. And we look at those as options to go after new use cases, and that's exactly what happened here in the context of our partnership with JPMorgan. This is focused on existing ACH payments, which are not bringing the value to the biller or the consumer that they are looking for. Frankly, though, very specifically, what we're doing here, the issue with some of these account-to-account payments is you never really know what balance is on the account. And our open banking capabilities are really providing a payment success factor here that tells the biller this is a good time to debit this particular account. So true value brought that somebody is willing to pay for, in this case, the biller/the merchant. So a good example of where there can be value created an alternative payment tools while this doesn't take away from the power the cards are bringing to consumers and merchants. So we see this as coexistence. Where this is going over time, we don't quite know, but our multi-rail strategy positions us well to play in either field. We'll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. Nice job on the quarter and the year. When we look ahead, and we're looking at the trends you're showing us for January, even despite easier comps on Omicron, it does look like you have pretty conservative assumptions built into the guide for the year for top line growth of low double digits. Just given the trends we're seeing even beyond for January, but ex Russia, you anniversary that after March and the numbers go materially higher growth rates. So can you just tell us if there's some building blocks like around what you're assuming on macro from today's macro activity going forward and maybe rebates incentives? Is that a factor here? Sure, Darrin. So let me provide you a little bit of color here. Look, I mean, what we've generally assumed in our base assumptions that I mentioned when I was delivering my prepared remarks is resilient consumer spending through 2023. I mean we see a resilient consumer today, and we're seeing a generally resilient consumer spending pattern going forward in our base case. The other thing which we've contemplated, as we mentioned, from a cross-border standpoint and particularly cross-border travel standpoint, the vast majority of the regions have now reached that state where they are kind of growing and growing at a healthy pace, but they're not growing at an accelerating pace. So they've reached that level of stability. So let me give you a little bit of color here. You'll remember as we are coming out of COVID, right, intra-Europe came back first cross-border standpoint. After that, we saw several inter-markets come back from a cross-border standpoint, U.S., U.K., Canada, Latin America, all of those. All of those are growing at a healthy pace, and we're assuming they'll continue to grow at a healthy pace but not at an accelerating pace. The one area where we are assuming an increase in terms of growth is around Asia Pacific. I mean Asia Pacific has been a lagger in terms of recovery of cross-border travel. And we're expecting that there will be -- with the borders recently opening in several markets in AP that there will be some level of recovery, which will come through there when you index back to 2019. So that's kind of generally been the base case we've kind of assumed. Look, I mean, to be perfectly honest with you, I think that the reality is we've got things which are helping us from a share win standpoint. We've got strong consumer spending. Our services capabilities continue to grow at a healthy pace. All of that is built into our guide as we go forward. Also remember that in 2022, we did have elevated levels of FX volatility, which were there in the market, which actually supported the growth rate which we had in 2022. It's hard to predict, but that looks like on a going-forward basis. We do our best assumptions on that from an FX volatility standpoint. But that's kind of the building blocks as to how we've gone about building our business. The last point I'll make is around rebates and incentives, you asked the question. As you can see, quarter-on-quarter, we talk about how we are delivering wins. We are winning with new customers. We are expanding our business with existing customers. So we are building in assumptions from a rebates and incentive standpoint, which will be consistent with what you're seeing in our track record from a winning standpoint as it relates to us. We'll go next to Lisa Ellis at SVB MoffetNathanson. Michael, I wanted to follow up, in your prepared remarks related to new flows, you highlighted the B2B POS payments as a notable opportunity area and highlighted a few new SMB co-brand wins there. Can you just talk a little bit more holistically about this opportunity? Remind us, a, how big it is; and then b, what's different about it. What do you have to do differently as Mastercard to capture this opportunity relative to the consumer side? Right, Lisa. So the opportunity here lies really in taking our existing set of tools, namely from the card ecosystem, very specifically the virtual card capability, which came through an acquisition many, many years ago that we've now built out ourselves into the leader here. So this existing set of tools and a huge opportunity in terms of flows to be addressed and make them more efficient, we're looking at $14 trillion from an opportunity perspective. If you recall what we laid out across the 4 flows, new flows, this is the -- one of the large ones here that we quoted. And the way to go about this is really to say, all right, who are the different players that we already have in our ecosystem. We bring VCNs into. There's a lot of deals with financial institutions, but there's also a lot of deals with partners out in the travel space, and the travel space is really the one that's been most promising for us, and that is coming back right now. So this is a near-term opportunity. Cash and checks dominated existing tools, existing partners. This is right for us to go after it, and we're leaning in. And Lisa, maybe I can just add a little bit out here, particularly as you think about the virtual card opportunity, which Michael just talked about. The differentiation, which is provided by technology, which is what Michael talked about by virtue of the acquisition, which we had with our virtual card capabilities, but there's also differentiation in terms of our approach from a go-to-market standpoint. And specifically, when you target flows from a go-to-market standpoint, you go on a vertical-by-vertical basis. So as you know, we've been very successful in the travel vertical. Part of the reason we've been successful in the travel vertical is having a deep understanding of what it takes at the travel integrator level to be able to embed your technology there so that you are the payment choice, which people will exercise when they have to make those payments. Similarly, as we look at that opportunity going forward, there are several other verticals we're making the similar kinds of advances in. So that's specific as it relates to the VCN piece. But you also asked about small business and the commercial point-of-sale opportunity, which is there. And the reality is we've been winning significant new deals in that small business opportunity. And we see, candidly, a very sizable market opportunity in commercial point of sale. A large part of that is still in cash and check. And the reality is, just like we did in B2M where we displace cash and check utilizing digital technologies and innovation, that's kind of the advances we're making also in commercial point of sale. So that's how we kind of see and frame the opportunity set across both of these areas. You can hear it. It helps you have a CFO that used to be the Head of our Commercial Products. We'll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan. I wanted to ask just big picture, if you would characterize visibility here for us on revenue versus, I guess, you can go back to pandemic or pre-pandemic. Just curious on visibility given you mentioned lots of moving pieces. And then same thing on expenses, you said in the prepared remarks here that you're prepared to adjust investments, if necessary. If the base case and the outlook here is to show some operating leverage, can we assume the same operating leverage if revenue weakens relative to expectations? Sorry for the long question. Sure, Tien-Tsin. So on your question around revenue, it's like I laid out, right? I mean, at the end of the day, we put our base case together. We've kind of laid out what our assumptions are from a base case standpoint. And at the end of the day, we don't have the crystal ball to actually suggest that, that is the way things are going to play out. But based on everything we're seeing in the nature of current trends as well as leading indicators, particularly as it relates to the overall strength of the labor market, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing from a base case standpoint as it relates to the outlook for revenues. As it relates to one component of revenues, which we oftentimes think about is around -- on an as-reported basis versus what it is on a currency-neutral basis, very hard to predict where foreign exchange markets go. But again, we've seen recent strengthening of the euro take place, and that's what we've kind of shared with you in terms of our assumptions from an FX standpoint. And then you asked about operating leverage. Look, I mean, the reality is we've always operated with the philosophy of delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. We look at the top line. We look at how our expenses up also against that top line. We have, in the past, demonstrated our capability to modulate our expenses to the extent we start to see adverse impacts take place on the top line and vice versa. And the reality is what we don't want to do is impact the long-term growth potential of our business. So we will continue to invest in our business with our eye on the long term. We will be prudent about not going into spaces from an OpEx standpoint, which are not in demand. Obviously, I'm kind of stating the obvious here. But the reality is the philosophy remains unchanged. We will look to deliver positive operating leverage as a company. And we have the tools and the ability to actually modulate expenses if top line -- if we feel like the top line growth is going to get impacted over the long term. We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW. First off, I'm glad we're getting rid of the relative to 2019 metric for good reason. Just a question on cross-border and sort of the operating assumption this year. I know there's a number of different trends that you guys talked about. But there's still a decent amount of pent-up demand. I guess, how do you think cross-border travel behaves in a backdrop where macro might get worse from here? Maybe you could use some historical precedent here. Maybe just give us sort of how you're thinking about it. Sure. So Sanjay, let me share a few thoughts on how we think about cross-border, right? So at the end of the day, there are numerous things which impact how people travel and spend in the cross-border environment. But at the outset, what I want to say is that the fundamentals around the cross-border proposition as delivered by Mastercard actually stand to be very sound just like they were in the pre-pandemic days. We said this through the pandemic, and it's played out in that manner. Now let me get a little bit more specific as it relates to pent-up demand -- your question around pent-up demand. Look, the reality is we all know from what we hear on the earnings calls of airlines that capacity is constrained from an airline standpoint. And with that constrained capacity and elevated prices, you're seeing that impacts come through when you do P times Q, which is price multiplied by quantity. You get kind of what the results and impact from a spend standpoint is. Fast forward, as capacity comes back online, one would expect that people will -- there will be some level of adjustment in prices because the demand-supply equation gets a little bit more in equilibrium. And so overall, we're not assuming that, that necessarily results in a tailwind because capacity comes back online, right, because there's going to be an adjustment which takes place from a price standpoint. Our view -- again, we hope we're wrong, and we hope cross-border spending kind of goes with more capacity, prices remain elevated and people continue to spend, but we've got to take a point of view on that, and that's what we're taking. The other point I'll make is as it relates to what the impact of FX rates is on cross-border and cross-border travel. Well, the reality is what we've seen historically is that when exchange rates move, for example, with the dollar strengthening, with the lag effect, you would tend to see inbound into the U.S. get impacted. That's only natural. It gets more expensive for people coming from different parts of the globe to come into the U.S. But what we've also seen is individual extend to then redirect their cross-border spend to other parts of the globe where they don't feel the impact of that come through. So movements in foreign exchange rates does have an impact on how we think about cross-border going forward. And just to add one point here, Sanjay, that is, over the last 2 years, we've been winning portfolios in the space. We've really focused on the space, expecting to come back. If you recall, let me just remind everybody here, across airlines, across travel -- online travel agencies, across lodging, across other forms of transports like trains, Marriott, Virgin Atlantic, Amtrak, JetBlue, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and so forth, we have won portfolios. And we've bolstered that in terms of market access through these partners with additional products. So there's Mastercard Travel Rewards out there, which is now in 80 countries. So we believe into the macroeconomic environment that Sachin just laid out, we have the better proposition. So it remains an exciting space. The pace in which we'll grow, we'll have to see that as characterized by what Sachin just said, but we certainly have a differentiated proposition in that. And one last comment I want to make, Sanjay, I'm happy you're excited about metrics and how we're changing the metrics. From a metrics perspective, I want to complete -- back to Lisa's question earlier. I mentioned the $14 trillion on commercial POS, but there's also $24 trillion on accounts payable, which makes the total opportunity in this combined space, $38 trillion. So that conversation earlier was an important one and a very big part of our priorities. We'll go next to Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America. I really appreciate the China cross-border data you gave there for both inbound and outbound. I think you said that inbound is running at about 20% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter and outbound at about 50% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much improvement you're expecting in those metrics in 2023 as the reopening progresses? And then separately, can you just make any high-level comments on growth for each of your 3 strategic pillars in '23? Sure. So first, Jason, I'm not going to share specifics as it relates to how we built our model up for the full year. What I will share with you is as it relates to the recovery of both inbound and outbound for China, we have built in some level of recovery as the year progresses. It's our best estimate as to what we expect to happen by virtue of the borders opening and the quantity and requirements being lifted. But suffice it to say that the opportunity is pretty sizable. The fact that we were in Q4 at 20% of 2019 levels from an inbound travel standpoint -- cross-border travel standpoint is just suggestive of the fact that if you just think about what's going on in the regions and how they've recovered and bounced right back and gone well above 2019 levels, there's a significant opportunity both on inbound and outbound as it relates to China. And sorry, the second part of your question, Jason? Just the 3 strategic pillars, what you're modeling for revenue growth on those in '23? Again, I mean, when you -- the strategic priorities, we've got payment services and new networks, as Michael has talked about. I mean I'll give you a general sense. I mean you know about -- from a payment standpoint, we've been doing this, and we've been doing this for many decades. And that is the substantive part of how we deliver our revenue growth. Over the last decade, we've shown you how services have grown and still growing at a healthy pace. In my view, the demand for our services capability still remains very strong. You've seen that we've been growing at a faster pace in services relative to the overall growth of our business. And I don't think we should assume anything different on a going-forward basis. And new networks is relatively nascent really. So again, I would put that into the space of it's growing. It's growing on a small base at a very healthy clip. But the reality is on the overall Mastercard, it's still to have a meaningful impact. So that's kind of the best I can share with you on that. Jason, I'd say that the model really is one not of separate pillars. This is an integrated business proposition where services differentiates payments. And payments is oftentimes a way to build out a further -- a broader set of services and so forth. So it kind of goes in a circle, a virtuous circle, I have to say. When you look at it, the -- historically, we gave you a number a couple of years ago that service is 1/3 of our quarter. It has been growing faster. I gave you an example earlier in my prepared remarks on Consumer Clarity, which is something that is transaction-related, and it's growing faster with 50 new issuers. So there's just a lot of momentum in there. But there is also the kind of services that are not related to the underlying payments business. For example, what the example I gave you on Test & Learn, where we're working with a set of customers to work on their base core business as in Lowe's, the example that I gave you. So different sets of dynamics, but they go hand in hand, and that is the power of the differentiated and diversified business model that we have. We'll move next to Rayna Kumar at UBS. We'll go next to Will Nance at Goldman Sachs. Maybe I'll squeeze one last 2019 -- versus 2019 question before the metrics go away. When we look at some of the kind of moving pieces in December, it seems like across some of the metrics, things seem to take a little bit of a step down on the 2019 stack. So just any color on what you're seeing on a regional basis between kind of e-commerce and travel and how those trends have kind of continued into January, maybe excluding some of the impacts of China that you're seeing. And then just a more numerical piece of that question as I -- appreciate the color you gave on the China metrics on inbound and outbound travel. Just wondering if you have any color on just the overall contribution of China to cross-border volumes. All right, Will, so I'll take your questions in order out here. You talked about some color around how we're seeing things shape up in Q4 relative to 2019 levels. We're seeing pretty stable levels as it relates to switched volumes, switched transactions and cross-border, in fact, marginally up on each one of them quarter-over-quarter. So for example, in switched volumes in Q3 as a percentage of 2019, we were running at 154%. In Q4, we were running at 156%. And you can see this in the slide deck, which we shared with you. The one thing to just keep in mind is in the U.S. in Q4, we have seen a little bit of an impact come through from lower gas prices, and that's kind of being reflected in the numbers you see right here. You asked a question from a regional color standpoint. I'd say there's remarkably consistent growth that we're seeing in most regions. For example, in Europe, Europe continues to hold up pretty well. Latin America and EMEA are also actually holding up pretty well from a growth standpoint. In Q4, China was in the negative, particularly in its domestic volumes. And again, remember, our -- we don't generate a lot of revenue from the domestic side. But it was impacted negatively because of the flareup in the COVID situation, which took place there. So that's one piece to keep in mind. Another piece to keep in mind is that from an India standpoint, we are -- now that we're out of the embargo and we've started new issuance, you still have the tail effect of the embargo coming through. So said differently, the fact that you actually for a year, we're not issuing new cards in India has a result and impact of attrition of old cards which are taking place, which need to be more than compensated for by issuance of new cards. And that takes time as issuers get ramped up and ready to go. So you've seen that come through in Q4 as well. But beyond that, I would say that we continue to see pretty good and consistent growth relative to 2019 levels across all our metrics here. And a step down compared to last year and the year before is, of course, there because you get the mathematics and the lapping effects and so forth. But to 2019, I think that's an instructive view here. It tells us that, yes, we're expecting a resilient consumer will continue to spend. And Will, you had asked the question about China. In my prepared remarks, I had shared with you that China inbound cross-border travel pre-pandemic was roughly 1% of our total corresponding volumes, and our outbound -- the similar metric from an outbound standpoint was about 2%. So I know that was the second part of your question. We'll go next to David Togut at Evercore ISI. Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. For the year ahead, could you talk through some of your assumptions on the biggest opportunities in Europe, Germany, Poland, Italy, when you think about both economic outlook and cash digitization? We've seen mixed reports 6, 9 months ago, more concerned about Europe given high gas prices. Now it seems like the outlook has been a little better with lower gas prices and a more mild winter. But any insights would be greatly appreciated. David, let me start off on that. So looking at Europe really in 3 categories, there's the U.K. on one hand, and there's emerging Europe and then there is Continental Central Europe. And slightly different picture on all of them. First of all, starting off with the continent here, the concern has been around for a while on rising gas prices and energy prices and the impact on the consumers' ability to spend. A combination of fiscal measures to provide cushions to consumers, along with energy-saving measures, along with the gas storage now reaching full capacity has really alleviated some of these concerns. So we continue to see a fairly resilient European consumer. That's our base assumption as we look forward. U.K. somewhat different economic outlook, and that might be a little more shaky there. But fundamentally, in this market, we are seeing a lot of tailwind for us from share gains over the last couple of years. So that works well for us. And emerging Europe continues to be a dramatic digitization opportunity as we've seen in markets like Russia, which unfortunately is not in our P&L any longer. But we have seen very high digitization rates, and we're pushing that in these emerging markets. Somewhere between, there's peculiarities like Germany where there was a significant digitization opportunity, and there still remains. But we caught up a lot in Germany over the last 2 years, particularly on the contactless side, which is now reaching half of the transactions there. So healthy mix in Europe and very strong share position with opportunities to come through from portfolio wins that we have shared with you over the last couple of years as they go into effect. And I'll just add, David, to Michael's point around the deals which we've recently won and announced. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, we had talked about Santander historically. That migration is in progress. And we're through the bulk of a 9 million card migration there. We expect to be complete by early 2023 on that one. NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard debit cards in December of 2021. That's well underway, and we would expect some of that to continue to happen in 2023. And then the other one we had spoken about historically was Deutsche Bank, and we expect that the migration of that one will commence somewhere in the middle of 2023. So just to give you a little bit of sense as to how we're kind of thinking about things. We'll move next to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi. I just wanted to drill into a couple of things now that we're getting rid of 2019 over the past few years. And looking forward, what has changed in terms of the growth algo? How should we think of that as we think of normalized growth visibility? And then this is a smaller question with regards to, specifically for '23, the spread between was and just how should one think of that? I'm going to need a little bit more clarity on the second part of your question, but we'll get to that. Let me take the first question first, which is as it relates to the growth algorithm. Just suffice it to say that the fundamentals of our business actually are very, very sound. The growth algorithm, which has actually enabled the strong growth we have delivered pre-pandemic, very much stands sound even today. So the reality is, if you think about PCE growth, you think about the opportunity for the secular shift to electronic forms of payment, you think about the fact that we're growing market share, you think about how we're delivering on our services capabilities and driving growth from that. And now as we're doing new and different things around new payment flows as well as new networks, that growth algorithm actually is very sound, very stable, very consistent with what we've historically had. And that's the way we think about the business for, call it, not only the near term but near medium to long term for Mastercard. Now Ashwin, I'm not sure I got the second part of your question. Could you repeat that, please? Yes. I was asking about the cross-border volume spread. How should one think of that as we think of this year? Yes. Look, I mean, our cross-border proposition sound -- is very sound and stable. And I think at the end of the day, like I said, most of the regions are now back to what I would call the stable growth rates that we would normally have seen in the pre-pandemic phase. The one exception is Asia, and there's a little bit of opportunity which we have in Asia, which we've contemplated in our thoughts for 2023. We'll move next to Ken Suchoski at Autonomous Research. Michael and Sachin, I wanted to ask about the cross-border recovery. We see the volumes for cross-border travel are well above 2019 levels. Where are you seeing the transactions versus 2019 levels on that same metric? Sachin, you made some interesting comments on price versus units. And I'm just trying to get a sense for how much the cross-border travel volumes are benefiting from inflation and spend per transaction. And how much recovery is still left from a number of transaction standpoint? Sure, Ken. So my comment is actually going to hold true for not only cross-border for -- largely for the business, if you think about it, right? You know our transactions or the growth in our transactions is impacted by our average ticket size. There are puts and takes on the average ticket size, not only in cross-border but even on domestic, which are influenced by numerous factors. One of which is inflation. The others are the mix between card-present and card-not-present. Because what happens is, typically, with more card-not-present, you tend to see a higher average ticket size, which results in lower transaction growth rate. Now that being said, also when you do more card-not-present, you have the opportunity to deliver more services. When you deliver more services, it allows you to actually have a compensating effect from a revenue standpoint. So I think those are 2 important things to keep in mind. The third, I would say, from an average ticket size standpoint, which impacts both cross-border and domestic, is what is the regional mix because different countries have different average ticket sizes, which influences what the growth rates are. Specifically on cross-border average ticket, it has been pretty stable year-over-year. And our assumption, as we kind of think about this is not knowing perfectly well where inflation is going to go. And the variables I kind of talked about, those are the things we factor into our assumptions as it relates to transaction growth on a going-forward basis. We'll take that question from Dave Koning at Baird. Maybe just to go back a little bit to Q1 guidance. You talked a little bit about this, but I know revenue you've got on a non-GAAP basis, decelerating something like 5% or so. But every metric -- every core metric in January accelerated by kind of 4% to 11%. Is there just tougher comps coming on some of those key metrics? Or is it rebates? Or maybe talk through a little bit about the gap and kind of what's going to happen in the rest of the quarter. Sure, Dave. A couple of thoughts. One, in Q1, acquisitions contribute less to our Q1 growth than they did to our Q4 growth because you're doing a sequential comparison between Q4 and Q1 in your question there. Number two, the suspension of operations in Russia has a greater impact in Q1 than it does in Q4. It's just the way the cadence of the revenues are. And then 2 other points I'd point out is Michael talked about the several wins we've got, active deal activity, which has been in play. We've got to contemplate all of that in our Q1 kind of thoughts. And then the last piece I'd mention is we did have elevated levels of FX volatility in Q4. I don't know where FX volatility is going to play out. We've done our best assumptions around that, but those would be the contributing factors. Michael, any final comments? Yes. So thanks for your questions. Thanks for your trust. Rayna, we will figure out your questions off-line. We can't get to those, unfortunately. The day will come when there's a call where there's more questions for me than for Sachin. I'm still hopeful we will get there at some point. But the story has been resilient consumer, and we still see some opportunity in cross-border for Asia. That's the base. We're winning. That feels good as we look ahead into 2023. And we have 28,000 excited people at Mastercard that are going to deliver on that opportunity. With that, thank you very much and speak to you next quarter. Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2022 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. My name is Norma, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed. Thanks, Norma. Good morning, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We refer to a PowerPoint presentation that is posted on our IR web page this morning. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call, including guidance and outlook for 2023 and beyond, reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including those noted in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially.   Today's call includes non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to our GAAP results in our earnings release. On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy? Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Northrop Grumman team delivered another year of strong performance in 2022, positioning our company for the coming year and beyond. A growing global demand environment and the team's success in capitalizing on competitive opportunities drove exceptional bookings.   Top line growth accelerated throughout the year, driven in part by improving labor trends. I'll note that we set our sales and EPS guidance ranges at the beginning of 2022, and even in a dynamic macro environment, we navigated the challenges to deliver at or above the high end of those ranges, and then importantly, to deliver capability for our customers.  This performance highlights our solid operating execution, our ability to win new business and the alignment of Northrop Grumman's portfolio to our customers' priorities. We enter 2023 with a backlog of more than 2x our annual sales. This strong backlog, along with increasing demand and rising global defense budget supports our expectations for continued growth.   Given this and supported by robust headcount growth, we have increased our 2023 sales guidance range from our October outlook. We are projecting solid segment margin performance that takes into consideration inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, consistent with the expectations we outlined on the October call. And we expect a greater than 20% compound annual growth in our multiyear cash flow outlook that supports continued investments in the business and significant returns of capital to shareholders.   Before providing more details on our outlook, I'm going to highlight a few notable achievements from the previous year that underscore the tenets of our long-term strategy and illustrate our positioning for the future. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world's most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company.   In 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions. We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale.   Further, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA's base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon's Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we've made in solid rocket motor capabilities.   We also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023. IBCS integrate systems that weren't designed to work together, creating a seamless air and missile defense network and allowing customers to better utilize their defense assets. This capability is needed more than ever to address advanced threats and it's one where we've seen a significant increase in interest across our global customer base with 10 additional countries expressing interest in obtaining this system.  We continue to keep our focus on innovating and leveraging our strong position in advanced technology. This includes the development of a new radar for the F-35. This radar is capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats and is compatible with variants of the F-35 aircraft. And we capped off a strong year with the historic unveiling of the B-21 Raider. The B-21 is a multifunctional platform with unmatched range, stealth and survivability, and it will be the backbone of future U.S. air power for decades to come.   We continue to perform well on the program and remain on track for first flight later this year. As the program transitions into low rate initial production, we are working to address macroeconomic conditions, especially related to inflation and their impact on material, suppliers and labor. Importantly, I want to highlight that our B-21 unit cost projections remain below the government's independent cost estimates. The program has strong support from the U.S. Air Force, Congress and our suppliers.   And in the words of Secretary Austin from last month's rollout, \"This aircraft is proof of the department's commitment to building advanced capabilities that will fortify America's ability to deter aggression today, and in the future.\" Our 2022 achievements underscore the breadth of our portfolio across a wide range of domains and technologies and the strong performance of the entire Northrop Grumman team.   As we look forward, defense budgets are on the rise, and we see our global customers continuing to seek proven solutions to address rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats. We are meeting their urgent needs in areas such as air and missile defense solutions, medium and large caliber ammunitions and armaments, advanced radar capabilities and global surveillance to name just a few. And we are partnering to expand our opportunity set and positioning our international business for future growth. We clearly saw increased demand in 2022, and we continue to expect to grow our international business over the next several years.   In the U.S., we are encouraged by the continued strong support for National Security, including overwhelming bipartisan support for a 10% spending increase in the fiscal year 2023 defense budget that was passed in December. Our portfolio and the capabilities we offer are well supported by the administration and Congress. Growing security challenges will test our resolve in ways not seen for a generation, and we are confident this administration and the new Congress will find ways to work together to meet them.  We expect the President's fiscal year 2024 budget request to support robust funding for the highest priority capabilities outlined in the National Defense Strategy.   And our strategy has positioned us well. We're clearly maintaining our technology leadership and growing our portfolio of offerings, which is aligned to customer priorities. Another key element of our long-term strategy is keeping a laser focus on performance and driving cost efficiencies throughout the business. The current macroeconomic environment reinforces the importance of doing so.   An example of our effort is the implementation of digital solutions across the company. Beyond the benefit of transforming how we design, test and manufacture the next generation of systems, our digital initiatives are streamlining business functions and increasing productivity. We are also optimizing our facilities and consolidating our real estate footprint. Every day, we seek new and innovative ways to drive performance and increased efficiency while remaining agile and meeting our customers' expectations.   Our capital deployment strategy supports our business strategy. We are investing to not only drive efficiencies but also to allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment. In 2022, we invested over 7% of revenue in R&D and capital expenditures to provide the capability and capacity needed to address the threats of today and tomorrow. We also continue to return cash to shareholders.   Last year, we increased our dividend by 10%, which was the 19th consecutive increase. And during the year, we delivered over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend and returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases. So looking forward to 2023, we are well positioned for continued growth, and our revenue outlook has improved from the high $37 billion range we shared in October.  We now expect sales to be in the range of $38 billion to $38.4 billion, representing about 4.5% growth at the midpoint. Margins are expected to remain solid in the 11.3% to 11.5% range. We are projecting strong free cash flow growth that supports our capital deployment strategy. And we expect to return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in 2023.   Our backlog, strong recent global demand growth and our ability to deliver products that address an increasingly complex security environment give us confidence in our outlook. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and more on guidance. Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank our team for another year of strong performance in 2022. We won several new franchise programs, delivered industry-leading top line growth and bolstered our talented workforce, with the addition of over 6,000 net employees during the year. I'll spend a few minutes on our fourth quarter and 2022 results and then discuss our future expectations in more detail, including our long-term cash flow projections.  We ended the year with nearly $79 billion in backlog, reflecting strong demand for our products and capabilities. We continue to convert our backlog into revenue at an accelerating rate with fourth quarter sales growth of 16%. This was enabled by our ability to continue strong hiring in Q4 as well as a higher volume of material receipts based on the timing of program demand. The team did an outstanding job of working with our supply chain to secure program material. And for the full year, our sales grew to $36.6 billion, representing organic growth of 3% and exceeding our prior expectations. Our operating performance and margins remained solid despite the continued pressures of the macroeconomic environment.   Our segment operating margin rate was slightly below our expectations at 11.3% in Q4 and 11.6% for the full year due in part to the impacts of inflation, which resulted in a lower level of net earnings adjustments. But margin dollar volume was very strong given the top line outperformance. A positive EAC adjustment in the quarter was on B-21, where we recognized a $66 million pickup on the EMD phase of the program, reflecting our latest assumptions regarding future incentives in that phase.   Continuing with our Q4 results. Our transaction adjusted earnings per share were $7.50, a 25% increase over the same period in 2021. Higher EPS were driven by robust growth in our segment top and bottom lines as well as a lower effective tax rate. The lower Q4 tax rate was driven by the recognition of an $86 million benefit from the resolution of a legacy Orbital ATK tax return, which we previewed in our guidance last quarter. And corporate unallocated costs were also below our expectations due to lower state taxes as a result of the R&D tax amortization law not being deferred.   For the full year, our transaction-adjusted earnings per share were $25.54, well ahead of our guidance range. Now turning to cash. We had an extremely strong fourth quarter, consistent with our historical pattern. For the year, we generated $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow, in line with our expectations. This was inclusive of a full year of cash taxes associated with the R&D tax amortization law as well as our final payment of deferred payroll taxes from the Cares Act legislation.   Moving to our pension plans. Slide 7 in our earnings deck includes our latest assumptions. After 3 consecutive years of double-digit asset returns, our plans declined by roughly 15% in 2022, in line with market trends. Our FAS discount rate increased roughly 250 basis points to 5.54%, which  was the driver of the mark-to-market pension benefit of $1.2 billion reflected in our GAAP results. These factors are also reflected in our latest pension estimates for 2023 to 2025.  As we previewed last quarter and updated in our slides today, we're projecting a decline in our noncash net FAS pension income and an increase in our estimated CAS recoveries. In total, our pension plans remain strong. As a result of the higher discount rate, our funded status has improved to nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years.   Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our revenue expectations have increased from our prior estimates, with the midpoint representing nearly 4.5% growth on top of the strong level in 2022. We expect Space Systems to remain our fastest-growing business. Sales are projected in the mid-$13 billion range, up over $1 billion from 2022 levels, with GBSD and NGI contributing nearly half of the growth and the rest coming from our broad space portfolio. Mission Systems sales are expected in the high $10 billion range, up mid-single digits, driven by restricted programs in our Networked Information Solutions business. And we continue to expect flattish sales at both Aeronautics and Defense Systems. While programs like B-21 and IBCS continue to grow, headwinds remain on legacy platforms as systems are retired. We expect Aeronautics and Defense Systems to return to growth in 2024.   And similar to our cadence in 2022, we expect first quarter sales of approximately 24% of our full year estimate, with sales ramping again throughout the year. With respect to margins, we expect our 2023 segment operating margin rate to be down roughly 20 basis points from 2022 levels. Challenging macroeconomic conditions, including extended lead times in the supply chain and high levels of inflation continue to put temporal pressure on margins. And while higher CAS recoveries provide a modest benefit to our cash flow in the coming years that create pressure in our overhead rates and EACs.   Similar in nature to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 when we recognized a favorable impact from lower projected CAS costs, this could lead to an unfavorable margin impact when we update our rates this quarter. We notionally expect this to have a 10 to 20 basis point impact on the full year.   In regard to the B-21 program, we expect the 2023 contract award for the first of 5 LRIP lots with the LRIP phase scheduled to run through approximately the end of the decade. We're continuing to work with our customer to address macroeconomic risks and enhance efficiencies in the program. As we've described in our 10-K, we do not believe that a loss on the LRIP phase is probable and therefore, no such loss is reflected in our results or guidance.   Now turning to our future outlook. We expect our 2023 earnings per share to range between $21.85 and $22.45 based on approximately 153 million weighted shares outstanding. This includes $450 million of net pension income, which represents a $4.30 per share headwind compared to 2022. Partially offsetting this nonoperational headwind is strong growth in segment performance and the lower share count, which adds roughly $0.90 of additional earnings per share and lower purchase intangible amortization largely offsets the higher tax rate.   Moving to cash. We expect 2023 adjusted free cash flow between $1.85 billion and $2.15 billion, consistent with our prior outlook as adjusted for current R&D tax law. Although we expect discussions to continue on Capitol Hill, our guidance and multiyear outlook are now based on current tax law for all years and do not include any refunds for R&D taxes paid in 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated at $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion in 2023 and a similar level in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. This is driven by investments to support several large new business wins from 2022.   Our guidance assumes we will not have an extended CR, a breach of the debt ceiling or a prolonged government shutdown as this is our current expectation.  Slide 12 in our earnings deck provides our long-term cash outlook, which is predicated on continued top line growth in our business generating strong and gradually expanding operating margins and converting those margins into cash. R&D-related cash tax payments should decline by about 20% per year. As I described, CapEx is expected to remain near 4.5% of sales in 2023 and 2024 before starting to decline in 2025.   After investing in our business, we continue to expect to return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we plan to be in the market for new debt issuance soon to support our capital deployment plans including the refinancing of near-term maturities. In summary, 2022 was another successful year for Northrop Grumman, and we continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders.   And with that, we're ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Kathy, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the B-21 cost estimated is below the government estimates. But as Dave mentioned, there are macro and inflation cost pressures. I mean this comment really stood out to me since in the past decade, we've seen many large defense development programs exceed costs and not just by a smidge but meaningfully. Can you provide more color on what the Northrop team is doing to manage this risk and how we should think about the LRIPs through the end of the decade? And what are puts and takes in terms of potential risk? Yes. So as we noted, we are performing exceptionally well on the B-21 program, and we have continued government support for the quantities of at least 100 that are represented in the program of record. But given that this contract was initially awarded in 2015, the recent and really unprecedented macroeconomic impact of inflation, labor, supply chain disruption has affected the cost estimate to perform on the LRIP phase of the program.   And importantly, we noted our projected cost per unit are still below the government cost estimates upon which the funding profile is based. And that's important because it supports the overall buy plan of the U.S. government. And just to, as a reminder on timing, the government hasn't yet exercised any of the LRIP options. So like we do on any price options, we continue to look at what the future may hold and reflect that in our estimates that complete, but those are indeed estimates of cost and future performance.   So while -- as we note in the K , we don't currently consider a loss on LRIP to be probable, if it were ultimately to occur, it would spread over all 5 lots of the program. And particularly, that's important related to any cash flow impact. So as we look at 2023, we do not see that as material in our cash flow outlook. And even as we put together our 3-year cash flow outlook, we wouldn't see that as being material. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what is contributing to B-21 cost estimates.   Inflation clearly is the primary driver there. as we think about what's changed recently in our estimates, and we are working to mitigate those impacts, as you say, and we have some time as we move forward and get into production to continue to do that. Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Maybe my first question is on space. The performance there is better than I think anybody was anticipating. What's underlying that? And how should we think about that going forward maybe even beyond 2023? Yes, Ron, you are stating it accurately the performance there has been better even than we expected, and it's largely driven by more success in competitive wins than we had anticipated. Generally in all of our business, we project a certain amount of success, particularly in competitive environment. And here, we've just done better than we anticipated. And so that's driven sales upside and the very strong book-to-bill that we've had in that business where their backlog now is more than 3x sales and supports our projections for long-term, steady and durable growth. And then you mentioned in your -- just as a follow-on in your prepared remarks that your growth has been supported by your ability to hire folks. How has that been -- I know, I mean, it's kind of across the entire industry and your supply chains, getting labor has been difficult, particularly skilled labor that's kind of up to spec. How have you guys been able to do that? And what's underlying that? It has been a key driver to generating 16% sales growth in the fourth quarter, in particular. We noted in the third quarter of last year that we were starting to see labor trends change in a favorable way. Our hiring had improved. Our retention had dramatically improved, and we saw that trend continue in the fourth quarter.  I think a few things contribute. We hire technology skills that are very akin to what the technology sector employees, and we've certainly seen softness in that sector that has led to a significant increase in applications to Northrop Grumman. But I'd also like to think it's to do to the reputation of our company as being a technology innovator and the successes that we were able to showcase last year like James Webb and the unveiling of B-21 really spiked interest in applications to -- for employment at our company. And so those 2 things in combination are certainly working in our favor in a differentiated way. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Just a follow up on an earlier comment. In the past, I think you've talked about 12% margins in 2024 and the 2023 guide is 11.5% or so. As you think about sort of inflationary pressures, what are you watching? And you mentioned some of the B-21 items as an example. So what sort of offsets that to get to that 50 basis points of expansion? As we've noted, we had talked about 12% being the fundamental margin rate that we believe this business, this portfolio can perform at, and we would be working our way back to that as particularly mix becomes less of a headwind in the middle of the decade. We still see that. But we are having these temporal pressures related to inflation that are flowing through all of our programs, B-21 most notable because of its scale and that we did it very long ago.   As we think about how we are offsetting those costs, we talked about some of those ways today. We are working to digitally enable our business, which reduces program costs directly and improve profitability. But we also are applying that to our back office to streamline business processes and reduce costs that flow into our overheads also making our rates more competitive.  And reducing the impact of cost growth. So those things that -- real estate has been key. You saw today, we talked about a few things that we did in the real estate area already in 2022, but we have many more of those lined up as ways to continue to offset any cost growth that we see and drive towards those higher margins. Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Kathy, Dave, Todd, I think we probably all agree the stock right now seems to reflect the idea that defense is going to be a bill payer as we move to a period of deficit reduction. And I realize this question puts you a little bit on the spot forecasting government spending. But I wanted to know if you'd expand on your optimistic opening remarks. Talk about your macro outlook relative to what seems to be being priced into your stock? And if you think modernization might be sacrificed as part of the budget negotiations? Yes. So we look at the stock price over a longer time horizon than weeks, and we've consistently outperformed the industry on a relative TSR basis over the long term. But as you indicate, -- we've seen some pullback in the last several weeks across the sector and even more so with Northrop Grumman. I am a little surprised at the level of relative pullback we've seen given our strong continued results, our growth outlook and the relative portfolio positioning that we have in the U.S. and internationally.   And to answer the second part of your question directly, I do not see the U.S. or our allies pulling back on funding their national defense strategy that is well aligned with the Northrop Grumman portfolio. So I'd sum it up by saying, with a strong backlog, growing global demand for our products, differentiated technology and the ability to attract and retain top talent, we're really well positioned to continue executing on the strategy that we have that is expected to deliver differentiated growth and a potential to generate greater than 20% free cash flow growth for at least the next several years, and we believe beyond.  So I think investors are going to like that. And we've been in periods like this before following sequestration, where there was noise in the system related to the government's commitment to national security.   But following that, it was one of the best periods of relative TSR growth at our company, and really, our industry has produced in a while. So I see this as a temporal speed bump in our past and yet our strategy remains strong to deliver value. Just as a quick follow-up on inflation. The comments on the B-21 that you've been making, is there a general trend here is when your contracts you're signing right now with the government, are they generally accounting for inflationary effects or are you not finding that? So our customers are engaging in conversations with industry to understand to motivate our investment in future capability and capacity, that is what they really want. And I think many of them now understand that shifting too much risk to industry doesn't support that investment, nor does it deliver the capability they need in a timely fashion. So with that, I expect we're going to see less the price development going forward. And they are specifically to inflation,  the industry broadly is pushing back on accepting long-term fixed price contracts right now. And they're asking for reopeners for inflation. We expect that to continue. And as our suppliers ask us for that, we, of course, are passing that on to the government. And really, that's just common sense. So I believe it will become the norm. Our next question comes from Douglas Harned with Bernstein. Last year, you had a decline in Aeronautics that we understood pretty well because you've got quite a few legacy programs that were ramping down, like JSTARS Global Hawk. When you look at this year, with your fairly flat guidance for Aeronautics, how do you look at the pluses and minuses when we look at B-21 growth but you still got some legacy programs that are declining. How do you see those offsetting each other? So Doug, this year is really a continuation of those same trends flowing through the top line. The programs that have been declining. We've seen the majority of those declines, but they do still flow into the '23, '22 compare. So it is things like Joint STARS and Global Hawk. F-35 being a big revenue contributor in AS is relatively flat. So that ties directly into the narrative about their revenues being flat. And then B-21 is an increase, but it's not a significant increase yet because we're just moving from EMD into LRIP and these 2 combined are not a significant increase in the program as of yet. Well, and then on a slightly different topic. When you look at rocket motors, and this is an important area for you. And I'm trying to picture what the growth trajectory looks like. And also just in a sense of your market share, you've got 1 competitor that is a mature player. There are new entrants coming into the space. How do you see the long-term evolution of your market share and how you're positioned in that area? So we stay focused on investing in the future capability needed and more so lately in the capacity needed. And in many ways, the reason we are being asked take on more share of the market is because we've been investing in this business and are able to take on that additional business because we have outfitted our manufacturing facilities to support the growth. As with the government is asking, we have been responsive. And so as a result, we are winning more business in that area. But we expect to be able to compete even as other new entrants come into the space because we do have a long heritage of expertise that contributes to our solid rocket motor business.   And that's for all size, as I talked today and highlighted some of the larger solid rocket boosters that we build in support of SLS and GEM 63 for Kuiper. But that's true in businesses like [indiscernible] , where we are taking on more of the needed capacity because we've been investing in our manufacturing capacity there as well. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the profitability in the space business. The margin guidance came down there, margin rate guidance came down there a couple of times during the year. And it's kind of perceived to be kind of a 10% business, I think, is what we've talked about in the past and looking to a second year in the mid-9s here in 2023. So what's changed there over the past year? Seth, it's Dave. So I think you pointed out accurately that we're now projecting a margin rate for space in the mid-10s going forward. There were a lot of puts and takes in that margin rate upward and downward throughout 2022. Obviously, it's a rapidly evolving business, a tremendous amount of backlog growth and new program activity added into that portfolio over the last couple of years. So we're really pleased with the volume we're adding both at the top line and the bottom line in that process. Obviously, a lot of new cost type work being added to that portfolio and that mix growing, but also work that will evolve toward fixed price over the next couple of years and some new fixed price programs in that mix as well.   So in aggregate, we think the mid-9s is the right way to look at 2023. In the coming years, we do see the opportunity for margin rate expansion. But I think the most important takeaway for the space business is that the volume of top and bottom line growth that we've been delivering over the last couple of years and now are projecting over the next few is really adding a lot of value there. Okay. Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, Dave. So the working capital performance was quite good in '22. I think the way that measuring here. Working capital actually came down a bit despite the growth and despite the tough operating environment, only 6% of sales, which is below some of your peers. What's the opportunity from here? Or is there kind of a normalization at some point where actually for a growing business, the normal level of working capital is higher? So let's talk about that for a few minutes. There is not a substantial change in working capital projected in the 3-year free cash flow guide that we gave today. There is more capital intensity in 2023 and 2024 that we've signaled throughout this year, given just how much more new business we were awarded this year and the additional capital investments that we need to make to support capacity and capability there.   We've talked about things like the Amazon Kuiper Award and and other areas of the business that Kathy just noted, we're making investments upfront for these long-term franchise programs. So that is a headwind to free cash flow. But we're pleased to be able to offset that and deliver free cash flow guidance for '23 that's in line with our prior expectations. That's supported by the growth of the business, both top and bottom line. The R&D tax numbers will come down steadily over the next 5 years. And then gradually, over the next several years, we'll see improvements in the CAS pension cost reimbursement based on current projections.   So not much change in working capital, but there are some other moving pieces in the mix. I think importantly, when we look at the underlying fundamentals of growth and margin rate, as we talked about in our scripted remarks, we do anticipate growth through this 3-year outlook that we've provided at the top line, and we are modeling small but gradual improvement in the margin rate as well. So that's a healthy underlying condition for free cash flow.   And while we're at it, as we think about this outlook for free cash flow, the foundation is set for strong free cash flow beyond this 3-year period. The second half of this decade will have more programs moving to production, fewer of these upfront investments required to do so. The foundation we've laid over the last several years of capital investment is going to pay off in the second half of this decade on many of those programs. And so that's a healthy environment for continued growth in free cash flow as well as the continuation of the R&D tax amortization rolling off as a headwind.   So when you look at the second half of the decade, I think your expectation should be more of the same strong growth in free cash flow that we've been talking about in the first half. And our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. I did have a couple of follow-ups on the B-21, if that's okay. And Dave, I think you alluded that the first LRIP contracts to be awarded in '23. I'm just curious, is that sort of the triggering event or whether or not you'd know you're in the loss or not at that point? And then Kathy, I know you said the 10-K disclosure is over the 5 LRIP lots. But I'm just curious, is it  tougher at the front end of those lot profiles? Is it more promises at the back end that you'd have time to fight off inflation? Anything on those 2 fronts? Sure. I'll start on your first of those questions. The award of that first lot of LRIP will be a noteworthy event but not a triggering event of any kind from an accounting perspective. We will update our projections quarterly as we have been. We'll continue to do so.  And so at this time, we don't believe that a loss is probable and therefore, we have not booked one. We do believe that a loss is possible, which is why we're including it in our remarks and our 10-K disclosures. It's something we will continue to work over time. Obviously, this is going to continue for a number of years. As Kathy has talked about, we'll continue to do everything we can to mitigate inflationary pressures and work with our customers and our suppliers in the process. Kathy, anything you'd like to add? Sure. So in answer to your second question, we do expect to have a better sense as the year progresses, and we'll update disclosures as we do. And as we look at the profile, there's nothing really notable. To your point, we have more time to work cost efficiencies in the later lots. But of course, we made some more aggressive assumptions about learning curves and the like as we would on any production program. So really nothing notable in the profile and how you might think about any potential loss in spread. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Dave, I've got a couple of cash flow questions for you. First of all, on basically cash taxes with the R&D tax legislation impact. What sort of tailwind are you expecting from this -- from 2023 and onwards? And then secondly, what are your assumptions for equipment sales in that cash flow guidance for 2023 or for the whole period? Sure. Thanks for those questions. The answers are pretty straightforward. As we noted, the impact on our cash taxes in 2022 from the R&D tax legislation was just under $1 billion. We would anticipate that being about 20% less per year, just under $200 million or so on average less per year. And so that is the magnitude of the annual tailwind that we'd anticipate for the next 5 years or so. Overall, cash taxes, excluding the impact of that R&D tax amortization will increase slightly over the coming years, but that's factored into our multiyear outlook.  And as for equipment sales, I appreciate the question there. We received the final payment associated with the equipment sale that we booked a couple of years ago in 2022. And so we don't anticipate we're having our multiyear cash flow outlook, any continued recoveries from equipment sales. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. This is actually Jack on for Cai today. Just a quick question back to kind of the Section 174, Dave, I know in the past, I'm not sure if you quantified that if you could actually provide that dollar figure if you could. I know it steps down 20% each year. But looking back at your guide from last year at this time for '24, it looks like a larger delta than an implied $700 million headwind. So just to confirm, is that incremental CapEx going higher? Or if you could just provide some color there, that would be helpful. Sure. I appreciate those questions. I think you have to the air math about right on 174. It was just under $1 billion in 2022, and it will decline by just under $200 million a year on average going forward. In terms of that 2024 guide, you're right that our CapEx expectations increased a bit given the volume of new business that we won this year that we'll be investing in going forward. No other material changes to 2024. We do anticipate growth as we've seen in '24 and then a real ramp in '25 as CapEx begins to decline, and you have the tailwinds as well in '25 and beyond from R&D tax, CAS pension recoveries and the underlying growth in margins in the business. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with RW Baird. Kathy, within Aeronautics, the service mix continues to be a bigger part of the story. I guess it's now about 22%. If you finish 22 and look, that's up from the mid-teens the last few years. Obviously, there's some puts and takes on why that is. But just wondering if this trend is going to continue and how you think about the impact on margins? Yes. So we do expect the trend to continue in terms of -- as assets get into service, we continue to support. But we also have assets like Global Hawk that are coming down. So I don't see a material change in that mix as we look forward, Peter. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital. Kathy, in your opening comments, I think you maybe called out international opportunities, perhaps a little bit more than I can remember from recent quarters. Can you help frame maybe how much of an uptick in international opportunities could be reflected or international sales could be reflected in the '23 guide, if that was all a part of any of the upward revision -- and then as you think about beyond '23, how meaningful is international in terms of an uptick for you? I know historically, obviously, it hasn't been as meaningful as part of the mix of some of your peers, but maybe you can comment on that expanding opportunity set? Yes. Thank you. So in the fourth quarter, we did see some meaningful uptick in Defense Systems, and you can see that reflected in our results, both from the areas that I outlined in this call related to ammunitions and armaments but also increased interest in IBCS, and we have the current Poland work continuing to ramp but the 10 additional countries that I've noticed that have expressed interest. So as we think about the near-term drivers, it's the things that we already have in production. But as we think about the longer-term drivers is areas like IBCS future sales.  And we are seeing that interest increase across the business, but most notably in '23, I think you will see that reflected as upside opportunity in defense. As we look at the enterprise over the next several years, we do expect our international growth rate to be double-digit, low teens compared to a U.S. growth rate that more in the norm of our mid-single digits. So as we think about international, we do expect it to grow as a percent of our portfolio in the next several years. And that's all based on international demand growing as a result of increased spending confirmations made by our allied partners. Our question comes from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Kathy, if I go back to 2018 when the group sold off quite a bit, Northrop got pretty active on buying back stock. And I think you even launched an ASR, if I recall correctly. So I'd be curious if that would still be your playbook this year if the valuation continues to come down? And whether you might lean on the balance sheet to do so just given the track record of having run a valuation-sensitive buyback program? Yes. Well, as you note, we have used ASRs as the tool in the past. And as we indicated in the call today, we do plan to put more than 100% of our free cash flow back into the deployment to shareholders. The fact that our valuation is down, really, we don't try to time the market per se. But we do think about that as we are kind of weighing our options for capital deployment this year, and we do have the flexibility to increase share repurchase from our original plan. So that is something we're actively contemplating. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro. Dave, I had one for you. In the operating income discussion in space, you had a big gain, $45 million charge. And you said it was all -- the $96 million gain only partially offset the lower EACs. When I look at the K for the year, you had minus $38 million in space versus $134 million last year. So if you kind of just discuss what happened in the quarter and just why such a significant change year-over-year? Sure. Well, that's a great question, George. Clearly, that's an indication of the broader macroeconomic conditions that we in our industry, and frankly, most other industries we're facing in 2022, and in our business, it impacted the level of net EAC adjustments in really each of our sectors in different ways. And you see it acutely there in space, as you mentioned. A number of those EAC adjustments were in the fourth quarter. And that kind of -- the net of all those puts and takes to include the inventory adjustment on a new commercial product line that you mentioned was another downside in Q4. Those were roughly offset by the upside from the land exchange transaction in space. So a number of puts and takes, but when you net it all out, not much overall impact on the space margin rate in Q4 or for the year.  We're forecasting a rate just above that level that we operated at in '22 as we now look at '23. And as I noted earlier, something in the mid-9s is our kind of going forward expectation for '23 margin rate in space. But Dave, it's still unusual to see negative EACs for the year. So I was just wondering, are there any specifics that you could point to maybe was for the year or just for this quarter? No single item was a driver of that of much more significance than any other. I think that alone, George, is an indication of the fact that this was more in line with broader macroeconomic pressures as opposed to any performance issue or contract issue in any particular program. This was broader and more widespread, but not significant on any one program in and of itself. And again, I think really just indicative here of the environment we were operating in, in a business with a lot of programs, a lot of new growth in recent years to be excited about. Okay. And then just one general one for you, Kathy. I mean, with the better sales growth you're guiding to in '23, a result of the budget or new awards won or both? And then also, with 16% sales growth in Q4 and outlay is likely to grow 7% or 8% in '23 based on the budget investment authority of 15. Why does the growth rate slow that much in '23? I mean why wouldn't it be higher than what you're suggesting? Yes. So as we noted throughout 2022, if we could break loose supplier deliveries and continue to improve labor trends, we could deliver accelerated growth. And fourth quarter exemplified a path to doing just that. As we come into 2023 with that momentum, the same holds, we are confident enough in our sales expectations as we sit here today to raise them above what we had said in October, largely because we are seeing those improvements in labor in particular.  And if those trends continue, we would have opportunity to even further accelerate growth in 2024. The budget does not play into this. We had assumed strong budget growth. It, of course, came to fruition in the '23 budget, and we continue to believe the '24 President's budget will also show growth. Norma, we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Great.  A lot of discussion on B-21 and EMD and LRIP. Just -- how should we think about what happens to AS margins over the next couple of years as I assume EMD flans out or starts to come down where you've been taking positive adjustments and LRIP ramps up from here? David, I'll start on that one. Our margin rate was particularly high in AS in 2022. That was driven in part by the strong performance on those EMD profit pickups associated with anticipated incentives on that part of the program. We projected a 10% or so level for AS margins in '23 and expect that, that's a reasonable kind of planning assumption at this point for '23. And as we look forward beyond that, a lot of the factors that are working into the '23 estimate would be those that we'd expect to continue beyond '23. So of course, we'll update you over time.  You mentioned B-21 EMD program will -- a portion of the contract will continue for a number of years on LRIP. We haven't baked any margin or cash in that part of the program into our multiyear outlook or our '23 guide. So we think that 10% level is the right way to think about kind of the underlying margin rate in AS in the near term. Okay. And Kathy, maybe your thoughts on what bookings could look like this year, what you're anticipating for the book to bill this year? Yes, David. So we had projected book-to-bill to be light in 2022, and it turned out to be 1.07. We are projecting it to be light again in 2023. I've noted before, we look at this over a multiyear period. We've been running at 1.2 for the last 4 years aggregated across those 4 years. So we still expect to be well over 1 when we think about a 5-year aggregated book-to-bill, but we do expect 2023 to be less than 1. All right. Great. Thanks. Kathy, over to you. So look, 2022 was another year of outstanding performance by the Northrop Grumman team, and I want to thank them. As we reflected on our call today, we're even more encouraged with the opportunities for continued growth and value creation for our company in 2023 and beyond. So hopefully, that conveyed to you. Thanks again for joining our call today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

         "Welcome to Visa's Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Como, Senior Vice President and Global Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Como, you may begin.

Jennifer, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. Visa's performance in the first quarter of 2023 reflects stable domestic volumes and transactions and a continued recovery of cross-border travel. Total Q1 payments volume was up 7% year-over-year or 135% versus 3 years ago, flat with Q4. Excluding Russia and China, payments volume was up 12% or 146% of 2019. U.S. Q1 payments volume was up 9% year-over-year or 144% of 2019, down 1 point from Q4. International volume, excluding Russia and China, was up 15% or 147% of 2019, up 1 point from Q4. Q1 cross-border volumes, excluding intra-Europe, grew 31% year-over-year and 132% versus 3 years ago, up 5 points from Q4. Excluding Russia, cross-border year-over-year growth was higher by 4 points. Travel-related cross-border volumes rose 6 points from 112% of 2019 in Q4 to 118% in Q1, driven by Asia Pacific, helped by China lifting restrictions, continued modest improvements inbound into the United States and CEMEA benefiting from the FIFA World Cup. Processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year or 139% versus 2019, and we processed 571 million transactions a day during the quarter. Although first quarter net revenues grew -- altogether, I should say, first quarter net revenues grew 12% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21%. In each of our growth levers, consumer payments, new flows and value-added services, we saw strong revenue growth. In our consumer payments business, we made significant progress this quarter through large deals with traditional issuers and co-brands. And with the pandemic largely behind us, we saw many businesses focused on payments through Visa's new flows capabilities. In addition, we continued to develop and expand our global value-added services globally. Now let me explore each of these growth areas. In consumer payments, credentials grew 8% overall, 11% excluding Russia, with strong double-digit growth in the United States, India and Brazil. Tap-to-pay penetration of face-to-face transactions globally was 72%, excluding Russia and the United States. In the United States, we surpassed a notable 30%, with San Jose, San Francisco and New York City all above 50%. U.S. drugstores went above 40% for the first time in the United States, and nearly 65% of Costco's face-to-face credit transactions were made with a tap. In the United States, we had several important renewals. First, we renewed our partnership with Bank of America in the United States, maintaining our current debit and credit business, including their Cash Rewards, Travel Rewards, Premium Rewards and newly launched Premium Rewards Elite consumer credit cards. We're excited to continue to invest together in the growth of our joint business and to innovate with Bank of America to deliver enhanced capabilities and improved experiences for their customers. Second, we renewed with Commerce Bank, a top 25 Visa U.S. issuer across their consumer and commercial portfolios. Finally, we also renewed our agreement with Capital One. In Australia, we renewed our agreement with the country's largest independent payment solutions provider, Costco, with over 4 million cardholders for debit and prepaid and also signed a new agreement for credit issuance. Also in the region, we extended our exclusive relationship with Kiwibank, the largest New Zealand-owned bank. In Latin America, we renewed with ICBC Argentina, one of the largest issuers in the country, and with Banco do Brasil, one of the largest Visa issuers in the region. In addition, we entered into a new agreement with one of the largest banks in Panama, Banco Nacional de Panamá. Also in Latin America, we reached a new strategic deal with fintech platform, Tigo Money, and parent company, Millicom, a leading provider of telecommunication services in the region. Visa and Millicom expect to offer Tigo Money's more than 5 million wallet users the ability to digitize their cash in an easy and secure way, making purchases wherever Visa is accepted with the Visa Tigo Money access card. Another strategic fintech deal was with NEO in India, a fast-growing cross-border-focused neobank with 5 million customers. We've extended our relationship from debit into credit to grow cross-border spending with affluent as well as corporate customers. We're also happy to share that we renewed and extended our global partnership with HSBC. Our agreement covers consumer and commercial and it will foster growth and digital acceleration. This deal also cuts across all of Visa's 5 regions.   As you know, Visa is the leader in travel co-brands globally, and I'm happy to report that we recently reached agreements with 3 important travel relationships. First, Qatar Airways' Privilege Club, which today has a split portfolio across networks around the world, has signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with Visa to enhance and expand its portfolio of co-branded payment initiatives with key financial partners across key markets worldwide. This expanded partnership creates a new world of opportunities for our Visa customers and Privilege Club members to collect and spend Avios, the rewards currency of Privilege Club. Second, with Southwest Airlines in the United States, Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for their co-brand credit card issued by JPMorgan Chase. It represents one of the largest co-brand partnerships in the world. Third, with Star Alliance and HSBC in Australia, this is the world's first credit card created with an airline alliance and is issued exclusively on Visa Credit. At the time of the launch, it brought together 7 Star Alliance carriers in a single credit card platform. Also, we recently advanced our co-brand partnership with Flipkart, one of India's leading digital commerce entities with a registered customer base of 450 million. So whether it's with traditional issuers or co-brand partners, we are continuing to position Visa well for the future. On to new flows, where this past quarter, new flows continued to grow with revenue up more than 20% in constant dollars led by strong growth in B2B payments volume and Visa Direct transactions. First, on the Visa Direct side, Visa Direct had 1.9 billion transactions in Q1, up 39% year-over-year, excluding Russia. We continue to grow globally. Non-U.S. Visa Direct transactions as a percentage of total transactions expanded nearly 20 points, excluding Russia, from Q1 '21 to Q1 '23. Building on the success of our remittance program with Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, we recently launched Malaysia as an additional origination market spanning across 6 currency payers with more currencies to come. We also continue to bring existing use cases to new markets. First, in Australia, Visa Direct is now enabling driver payouts with DoorDash. Second, we launched our inaugural P2P program in South Africa with FNB, one of the country's largest banks, to enable their 10 million active customers to move money within their mobile app using Visa Direct rails. Third, we launched our wallet cash payout program in Bangladesh with bKash. With this launch, the nearly 65 million bKash users can make wallet to money bank transfers, 24/7 in near real time using Visa Direct. We are enabling several use cases, including seller payouts in the United States on Poshmark, a social media marketplace where more than 80 million registered users, and card top-offs with fintech GoHenry. As a follow-on to the issuance deal we announced last quarter with them, GoHenry is enabling its members to top up their child's prepaid Visa card with Visa Direct first in the U.K., with plans to expand this service across Europe in the future. In addition to Visa Direct, we had noteworthy developments in the B2B space this past quarter, where commercial payments volume grew 15% in constant dollars. In traditional issuance, we signed an agreement with Raiffeisen Bank for a new commercial credit partnership in addition to renewing customer -- consumer credit across their 3 million clients in Austria. And in the United States, we renewed with UBS for consumer credit and debit as well as several business credit portfolios and Visa Spend Clarity for Business. Another issuing partnership was with Stone, one of the largest acquirers in Brazil focused on small businesses. Stone has recently become a Visa debit and credit issuer of cards that could be embedded digitally in its wallet.  On the virtual card front, for accounts receivable and payable, we completed several agreements. First, Divvy, an expense management platform owned by Bill, has renewed its agreement to offer Visa virtual cards for small and midsized businesses in the United States as part of its expense and vendor payment solutions. Second, Viewpost converts U.S.-based B2B check payments to Visa virtual cards. And together, we are expanding card opportunities for issuers and corporates by offering a solution that can be deployed easily to every commercial business that still produces checks. Third, we've reached an agreement with Plate IQ, a leading end-to-end accounts payable automation provider in the United States with direct integrations to accounting systems. Plate IQ will be offering a Visa virtual card solution to commercial partners across multiple industries including restaurants and hospitality, retail and accounting and bookkeeping among others. Fourth, in our Asia Pacific region, SUNRATE, a global payment and treasury management platform has launched Visa virtual cards as part of its solution for more than 1,000 B2B clients, including global online travel agencies and small business customers. Fleet issuance continues to grow as well. This quarter, we issued -- we signed with Zemo, a European fleet and mobility solutions provider to issue Visa open loop fleet and fuel commercial cards as they expand from 3 European markets to 10. In the United States, Highnote, a cloud-native card issuance and embedded finance platform, expanded its relationship with Visa with a 5-year card issuance agreement across credit, debit, virtual solutions and fleet. In addition, Highnote became certified as a Visa fleet card processor, which provides businesses with more specific product category level controls and more detailed and faster data for real-time decisions on new fleet and fuel card programs. B2B is an active space for fintechs, and Visa continues to partner with new players to drive innovation for businesses. A recent example is Konfio, a fintech in Mexico that has already issued approximately 50,000 Visa small business cards and recently expanded its agreement to issue Visa Business Infinite cards. In addition, they are positioned to grow acceptance in the market with their newly established acquiring business, Sr. Pago. Now moving to value-added services, which had about $1.7 billion in revenue this first quarter, up more than 20% in constant dollars. Remember that our focus for value-added services is threefold: one, to deepen client penetration of existing products; two, to build and launch new solutions; and three, to expand geographically. CyberSource is a great example on all 3 areas of focus. First, on deepening client penetration of existing products. CyberSource's Decision Manager offering provides broad capabilities to existing CyberSource clients and has experienced strong growth throughout the pandemic, more than doubling transactions in the last 3 years. In Q1, transactions utilizing Decision Manager grew in the low teens year-over-year, demonstrating the continued demand for this solution even as we enter a post-pandemic environment. Another area of growth we have mentioned is with acquirers who utilize CyberSource's capabilities to offer them to their merchant clients. In Q1, we signed agreements with several acquirers for gateway services, including Elavon in North America. In Saudi Arabia, Saudi British Bank has announced its strategic partnership with our CyberSource payment gateway and risk platform to enhance the overall capabilities of SABB's payment gateway with the aim of fostering the bank's growth in an evolving and dynamic e-commerce space. On extended geographically, we've continued our efforts to strengthen our global presence. Our non-U.S. CyberSource transactions have nearly quadrupled since the first quarter of 2019, and they now comprise the majority of our transactions led in particular by the Asia Pacific region. CyberSource has also created new offerings. While historically CyberSource has been an e-commerce capability, over the past few years, we have accelerated the product development of our card-present and omnichannel offerings, including with the acquisition of Payworks back in 2019. In the past quarter, we saw nearly 50% of year-over-year increase in card-present authorized CyberSource transactions. Other value-added services highlights this quarter include our innovative dispute capability through Verifi, which saw nearly 40% growth in cases processed this quarter as we expanded globally with more than 1/3 of our cases from outside North America. This rapid dispute resolution solution automatically resolves disputes between merchants and issuers through the acquirer of rails, reduced the average time to resolve a dispute from 24 days to typically seconds.  And Tink, our open banking platform continue to deepen and develop relationships across Europe. Tink recently signed a master agreement with BNP Paribas to be their main open banking and money movement services provider for millions of customers across Europe. Tink is already live with several businesses in the group. 3 million customers use Tink's money management, data enrichment and transactions products at BNP Paribas Fortis in Belgium and BNL in Italy. Tink has also renewed and expanded its commitment with ABN AMRO to integrate Tink's money manager and data enrichment products into the bank's app for more than 3 million customers. In conclusion, in the first quarter, Visa delivered very strong results and continued to effectively execute our growth strategy. Vasant will go into detail on our thoughts for the rest of the year, but I'd like to make a few other brief closing comments. We will continue to manage our business for the medium to long term, and we'll invest in initiatives that are compelling and will provide future growth, all while being very mindful of the current environment. I continue to see a bright future for Visa as we look ahead to the rest of this year and beyond, and I believe we have the right strategy to continue to deliver great results. As we announced in November, effective February 1, 2023, I'll be stepping down as CEO and assuming the full-time role as Executive Chairman. I'm exceedingly grateful to the Board and leadership of Visa in addition to all of our passionate 26,500 employee colleagues who help make this job so rewarding. I'm proud of all that we have accomplished together since I started in 2016. Ryan McInerney will become Visa's CEO, and I cannot think of a finer leader to continue to position Visa at the center of money movement in increasingly innovative ways. I worked side by side with Ryan for almost 6.5 years. He knows our business, our clients, and he is deeply respected by our employees. He and his team will do a great job, and I expect this transition to be totally seamless. With that in mind and as Jennifer alluded to, I've asked Ryan to join the Q&A portion of our call today. But before that, let me hand it over to Vasant to provide financial highlights for the quarter and our thoughts on the second quarter and beyond. Thank you, Al. Good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal first quarter results reflect sustained growth in domestic spending and continued recovery in cross-border travel. Net revenues were up 12%, GAAP EPS up 8%. Non-GAAP EPS was up 21%. The strong dollar dragged down reported net revenue growth by almost 3 points and non-GAAP EPS growth by approximately 3.5 points. Discontinuation of operations in Russia reduced net revenue growth by about 4.5 points. Adjusted for Russia, net revenues were up almost 20% in constant dollars. Net revenue growth exceeded our expectations as value-added services and new flows growth were very strong, currency volatility stayed high and client incentives were lower than anticipated. A few key highlights. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 7% year-over-year and 35% above 2019. Excluding China and adjusted for Russia, global payments volume was up 12% year-over-year and 46% higher than 2019. U.S. payments volume was up 9% year-over-year and 44% over 2019. In constant dollars, international payments volume, excluding China and Russia, was up 15% year-over-year and 47% above 2019. U.S. holiday spending growth was in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and up more than 41% versus 2019. E-commerce maintained its share of retail spending versus last year, up over 5 points since 2019. Spending continues to smooth out over the holiday season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday still significant shopping days but less important post pandemic. Holiday spending around the globe was generally consistent with U.S. trends. The cross-border travel recovery continues. However, as expected, the pace of recovery has moderated as most borders are now open, including Japan in October and now China in January. As a reminder, we saw a very sharp cross-border travel recovery in October and November of 2021, which we are lapping. Index to 2019, cross-border travel volume, excluding transactions within Europe, rose 6 points in the first quarter versus a 20-point gain in the third quarter of fiscal year '22 and 10 points in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. New plans and -- new flows and value-added services revenue sustained robust growth in excess of 20% in constant dollars. In the first quarter of fiscal year '23, we bought back approximately $3.1 billion in stock at an average price of $198.74. Contributions to the litigation escrow account, which have the same effect as a stock buyback, added another $350 million. We also distributed $945 million in dividends.  Now on to the details. In the U.S., credit grew 10% year-over-year and 35% over 2019, lapping the credit recovery from last year and as compared sequentially to last quarter, impacted by retail spending and fuel prices. U.S. debit grew 8%, up sequentially over last quarter. Level with 2019, debit grew 55%, so standing significantly above the pre-COVID trend line even as credit has recovered. U.S. card-present spend grew 8% year-over-year, impacted by fuel prices and retail spend as compared sequentially to last quarter. U.S. card-present spend was 26% above 2019. U.S. card-not-present volume, excluding travel, grew 9% year-over-year and was 65% higher than 2019. E-commerce spend remains well above the pre-COVID trend line even as card-present spending has recovered. On the international front in constant dollars, Latin America was up 25% year-over-year and 107% higher than 2019. Our CEMEA region, excluding Russia, grew 25% year-over-year and was 108% higher than 2019 as we saw all through FY '22 growth in both regions was fueled by client wins, cash digitization and acceptance expansion. Europe was up 10% year-over-year and 34% higher than 2019, impacted by a portfolio conversion that is now nearly complete in the U.K. Ex U.K., Europe volumes grew 28% year-over-year and was 71% above 2019, reflecting share gains in multiple markets. Ex portfolio conversions, volume trends in the U.K. remained stable. Asia Pacific, excluding China, continued to recover, up 16% year-over-year and 34% above 2019. Global processed transactions were up 10% year-over-year and 39% over 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe but including Russia in prior periods, were up 31% year-over-year and 32% over 2019. Excluding Russia, year-over-year growth was higher by about 4 points. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel and excluding intra-Europe, grew 3% year-over-year and was 55% above 2019. Adjusted for cryptocurrency purchases and Russia, cross-border e-commerce spending grew in the low double digits. Cross-border card-not-present, excluding travel, represented over 40% of total cross-border volume in the first quarter. Cross-border travel spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 63% year-over-year and is now 18% above 2019. Cross-border travel, excluding Europe, index to 2019 went from 114 in September to 121 in December. Travel in and out of Asia recovered sharply in the quarter by more than 12 points from the mid-70s index to 2019 to 85 for outbound and more than 90 for inbound helped by Japan. Japan alone improved by about 50 points since opening its borders in October. With China lifting restrictions on January 8, we expect more recovery to come. Europe inbound and outbound remained strong, with the travel index to 2019 in the 120s for outbound and 130s for inbound, both up slightly from the fourth quarter. Travel outbound from the U.S. to all geographies continue to be strong in the low 140s index to 2019, up 6 points from the fourth quarter. Travel inbound to the U.S. approached 2019 levels and improved 4 points in the quarter, likely due to the weakening dollar. Travel into Latin America and the Caribbean remained very strong and stable, indexing around 150 to 2019 levels. Travel in and out of CEMEA indexed in the 130s and mid-120s, respectively, relative to 2019, with outbound up more than 10 points in the quarter and inbound by more than 15, helped by the FIFA World Cup. Finally, some color on Mainland China post the removal of COVID-zero policies. The 40-day Spring Festival season is underway in Mainland China, the world's largest travel event. Domestic travel is rising sharply. From a revenue standpoint, this will not contribute much. In terms of outbound mainland Chinese travel, this will pick up steam as more flight capacity is available, ticket prices moderate, new passports and visas are obtained, and restrictions are lifted in some corridors. The initial destinations for mainland Chinese visitors look to be Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, in particular, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Inbound travel to Mainland China has not increased much and may not until the COVID situation settles down. Moving now to a quick review of first quarter financial results. Service revenues grew 10% versus the 10% growth in fourth quarter constant dollar payments volume. Exchange rate drag was offset by growth from business mix, pricing and card benefits. Data processing revenues grew 6% versus the 10% process transactions growth. The primary reason is that our data processing revenues are impacted by Russia. However, our transactions growth is not. Adjusted for Russia, data processing revenues were up 10%. International transaction revenues were up 29% versus the 31% increase in constant dollar cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe. Revenue growth was helped by high currency volatility, although lower than the fourth quarter and pricing actions, which were offset by exchange rate shifts. Other revenues grew 31%, led by marketing and consulting services, pricing actions and acquisitions. Client incentives were 26% of gross revenues, below expectations due to some adjustments based on client performance and other items. For the year, we expect to renew about 20% of our payments volume with a good amount already completed in the first quarter. Revenue growth was robust across our 3 growth engines. Consumer payments growth was led by the recovery in cross-border volumes, high currency volatility, and continued strong domestic volumes and transactions. New flows revenue growth was over 20% in constant dollars. Commercial card volumes grew 15% year-over-year and are up 45% versus 2019. Excluding Russia, Visa Direct transactions grew 39%. Value-added services revenue was also up over 20% in constant dollars, driven by higher volume, increased client penetration and select pricing actions. Currencycloud and Tink added about 0.5 point to revenue growth.  GAAP operating expenses grew 25%. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 15%. Non-GAAP operating expense growth was higher than expected primarily due to a smaller exchange rate benefit. The primary drivers of expense growth were personnel costs from hiring activity in the second half of last year and into the first quarter as well as G&A expenses driven by lower exchange rate benefits, higher travel and expenses from new acquisitions. Marketing increased 18%, primarily driven by the FIFA World Cup spend and client marketing. We recorded losses from our equity investments of $106 million. Excluding investment losses, non-GAAP nonoperating expense was $7 million, benefiting from higher interest income due to rising rates and some other items. Our tax rate was lower than expected due to the resolution of a tax initiative coming in at 16% GAAP and 16.5% non-GAAP. GAAP EPS was $1.99. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 21% over last year, inclusive of an approximately 3.5 point drag from the stronger dollar. Through the first 3 weeks of February, business trends have remained strong and stable. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. payments volume was up 14% with debit up 13% and credit up 14%. Lapping of Omicron-related weakness from last year has contributed to strong January month-to-date growth. The Omicron-related uptick will fade as we get into February. These trends are generally consistent with performance in major markets around the world. Processed transactions grew 14% year-over-year. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 36% year-over-year and was 42% over 2019 and 32% over 2020. Card-not-present non-travel growth was 75% above 2019 and 52% above 2020. Travel-related cross-border volumes were 25% above 2019 and 20% above 2020. We are now past the pandemic recovery stage on domestic volumes and transactions. As such, starting next quarter, we will no longer provide comparisons to 2019 for payments volumes and processed transactions. Since the cross-border recovery is still ongoing, we will continue to provide comparisons to 2019 for cross-border volumes through this calendar year. Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we are assuming that trends in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are sustained with some benefit from lapping Omicron in January last year. As a reminder, discontinuation of operations in Russia will impact reported payments volume growth rates in the second quarter. Russia will not impact reported processed transactions growth. Cross-border e-commerce trends have been stable, too, especially when you adjust for Russia and crypto-related volatility. We're assuming cross-border e-commerce growth rates sustained through the second quarter ex Russia and crypto. The cross-border travel recovery continued generally in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We are assuming recent trends to sustain into the second quarter. We expect most of the Mainland China travel recovery in the second half and beyond for reasons I outlined earlier. We expect outbound travel from Mainland China to recover first. The pace of inbound travel recovery will depend on the COVID situation. Discontinuation of operations in Russia will reduce second quarter net revenue growth by almost 5 points since we recorded nearly 2 quarters' worth of service fees in the second quarter of fiscal year '22. Based on where the dollar is today and the forward curve, exchange rates will reduce reported net revenue growth in the second quarter by about 2 points. When you put all this together, our planning assumptions get us to mid-teens constant dollar net revenue growth in the second quarter on a run rate basis, i.e. adjusted for Russia. With an almost 5-point Russia impact and a 2-point exchange rate headwind, reported nominal dollar Q2 net revenue growth would be in the high single digits. Client incentives were below our 26.5% to 27.5% range of gross revenues in the first quarter. Second quarter client incentives are expected to run higher at the upper end of the range, finishing the first half in the middle of the range. As we indicated in October, operating expenses growth rates will moderate through the year as we reduce the rate of increase as well as lap higher levels from last year. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expense growth in nominal dollars is expected to be 2 to 3 points lower than the first quarter expense growth. Our third quarter non-GAAP operating expense growth rate is expected to decline an additional 2 to 3 points, with a further 2 to 3-point reduction in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP results exclude certain acquisition-related items and the litigation provision from the third quarter last year. We currently expect non-GAAP nonoperating expense to be in the $40 million to $50 million range in the second quarter, driven largely by higher interest income from our cash balances. Our tax rate is expected to be at the upper end of the 19% to 19.5% range for the rest of the year. With a non-GAAP 16.5% rate in the first quarter, the full year non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to range between 18.5% to 19%. As we said last quarter, should there be a recession or a geopolitical shock that impacts our business, slowing revenue growth below our planning assumptions in the second half, we will, of course, adjust our spending plans by reprioritizing investments, scaling back or delaying programs and pulling back as appropriate in personnel expenses, marketing spend, travel and other controllable categories. In a business like ours, this always requires a careful balance between short- and long-term considerations. We have contingency plans in place and will activate them should we need to. Our business has been resilient so far this year. Our first quarter performance has demonstrated strong consumer payments growth from cash digitization and client wins. New flows and value-added services momentum remains very strong. There is still much uncertainty from an economic standpoint in the months ahead. We will remain vigilant and ready to act. As we look past fiscal year '23, we remain as optimistic as we've ever been about the long-term growth potential of our business. Before I finish, this is a sad day for me personally. It's Al's last week as CEO. Al has been the best CEO I've worked for, and I've worked for many in my career. Al is a wonderful human being, an exceptional leader with extraordinary business judgment. It has been an eventful 6 years. Despite a 3-year global pandemic, revenues have almost doubled, non-GAAP EPS is up over 2.5x, and our stock price has tripled during Al's tenure. I will miss you as CEO, Al, along with 26,500 or so others at Visa. With that, I'll turn this back to Jennifer. Thanks, Vasant. And with that, we're ready to take questions, Jordin. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Congratulations to Al and Ryan as well. Vasant, as we think about your baseline plan forecast, how are you factoring in the economy? I mean are we assuming resilient consumer, stable economy or are you assuming some mild downturn? Well, we went through what we call our planning assumptions last -- on the last call for the full year, and we told you we had assumed no recession. As you can see, business trends have been remarkably stable. The spend levels just around the world, they've indexed in the mid-140s for almost 4 quarters right now, and there's no evidence of a change in trend. That's reflected in our second quarter outlook. At this point, we're not changing any expectations for the second half. I mean, clearly, the dollar has weakened a bit so that will change the exchange rate impact in the second half, but we're not changing any of our views in the second half. I mean they are planning assumptions. And if there is a slowdown, then we will react accordingly. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. So it's nice to see that -- it seems like from the trends you're seeing in Q1 and what you're guiding for, for Q2 is an element of conservatism based on the trends so far relative to what we could see in the second half, which I think is what the Street probably wanted. But when we just think about the underlying trends for a moment, I mean, some of the strength we're seeing, like debit being up still high single digits constant currency in the U.S. on really tough comps, combined with other services, maybe you could just touch on what's the driving forces of both of those metrics because they were a little better than we thought. And I don't know if it's Visa Direct in the debit side helping or it's other factors and share, and then if you could comment on other revenue also strength. Yes. On debit, it's what we told you earlier. In general, if you look at the -- looking at 2019 has kept us honest so to speak. It's a good view of what's going on. And there's -- in total spend, it's remarkable stability. What's happening is as good spending slowed down a bit, services spending really took up all the slack. And so consumers have just shifted their spending, but they're spending the same amount, and that's why debit has stayed resilient. Debit has been the biggest beneficiary of the move to digitization that happened globally and including in the U.S., more e-commerce, more tap-to-pay, more people using digital credentials just about on any payment occasion. So some people were worried that when things settle down, that debit might start to see some slowdown. But as you've seen, debit has stayed resilient even as credit has recovered, which has kept our overall payment volumes very stable. Those would be the big trends. And the other question? Other revenue. And other revenue was helped by mostly marketing services and consulting revenue, a fair amount of that linked to the FIFA World Cup. There was a lot of client-related marketing and spending related to the World Cup. Clients ask us to activate a variety of programs and that certainly helped other revenue. Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Wanted to kind of double click on some of the comments you made around China. It sounds like you guys are looking towards that region as being a fairly big driver of continued recovery in cross-border travel. I think we heard this morning from your competitor that those volumes in aggregate seem to only be something like 1% to 2% of overall cross-border volumes pre-COVID. So was wondering, given how much of a focus this is for investors as a driver of continued strong growth, can you put some guardrails around how we should be thinking about the magnitude of impact of China once it's fully reopened relative to kind of what we saw in the most recent quarter? Well, a couple of things. First, our numbers are fairly close to those of our competitor. We are -- as Vasant said, we really think that, first, we're going to see the travel be outbound from China to Southeast Asia. I think it's going to be still a bit of time before we're going to see a Chinese traveler back in Europe at the level of prepandemic or back in the United States at the level of prepandemic. And I think it's going to -- people are going to wait and see what's happening with COVID within China. So Vasant talked about the fact that we're not counting on any kind of recovery back -- inbound into China into the second half of the year. But my personal expectation is that we'll see probably a spread of 3 to 5 quarters before -- starting in the second half before China gets back to a level of prepandemic or 2019. So it is -- for us, it's -- we have built our plan around pretty much what Vasant said in his remarks and what I just said. And if China comes back faster than what we're saying, then obviously, that will help us. If it comes back slower, it will have the opposite impact. Yes. I mean in terms of thinking about the impact, you all and we all have been tracking how is our cross-border recovering relative to pre-COVID levels and are we back on the trend line and so on as you know. And we've told you now for a few quarters that many corridors, and I went through a lot of that, are well above the 2019 level. The 3 that were not and are still not, U.S. is approaching -- U.S. inbound is approaching 2019 levels and was held back by the strong dollar, but Asia is still, and I went through the numbers, quite a bit below 2019 levels. Most of Asia is open. Only China isn't. So if Asia is going to get back to pre-COVID levels and back to the original trend line, that's where the China impact is going to be visible. And then you expect and we expect that cross-border travel index to keep improving through the year. For that to happen, we obviously need China to come back, so it is important. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with SVB MoffettNathanson. I had a question about the evolution of Visa Direct. You highlighted the plus 39% year-on-year growth ex Russia in the quarter. Over the last few years, you've been talking a lot with tap-to-pay and contactless about there being sort of this inflection point dynamic where you reach a certain level of critical mass and then growth really accelerates. Is this similar dynamic true for Visa Direct? And can you give us a sense for sort of how we should think about that evolve over the next couple of years? Well, I think, Lisa, you're absolutely right. We're focused in Visa Direct at this point on extending into new geographies, new use cases and more cross-border. I would say those are our focuses. Initially out of the chute, Visa Direct in a country goes through Phase 1, which tends to be P2P before you then get into things like gig economy payouts and transactions like remittances or insurance payments, those kinds of things. So in the United States -- and every country is going to go through this kind of evolution where they'll start with P2P, get into things like gig economy payouts and then get into more -- and remittances and then more sophisticated use cases. And the United States is much further along that continuum. In other countries, we have made some good progress kind of in that first phase or 2 but haven't gotten into more sophisticated use cases. And then in other geographies, frankly, we're still not there.  So I think there's a tremendous amount of gas left in the tank in Visa Direct when I look at the opportunities to take use cases to more sophisticated levels in more markets, to open up more markets and to put a real focus on cross-border Visa Direct transactions, which we'll have better yields to them as well. So I think your bottom line theory of your question is -- has some real legitimacy to it, although I would say that it will be probably a bit longer elevation -- a bit longer period of time before you meet the maturity simply because of the different amount of use cases, whereas tap-to-pay is really kind of a single type of initiative. Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Good job. I guess my question, rest of world debit is the 1 place where, I guess, numbers were a little weaker than we had thought, negative 2% constant currency. Is that just a function of portfolio deconversions, Russia, some of the one-off things? And when does that kind of inflect back into positive territory? I think, Dave, when you look at it ex China and ex Russia, it grew over 10%. And then, yes, the U.K. migrations, in particular, are happening at a faster pace than we thought. And as Vasant said in his remarks, they're almost fully migrated, so certainly, that is having a dragging impact on the growth as well. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Al, could you give us your latest thoughts on sort of balance sheet deployment, M&A strategy, what you might be looking for, whether this environment is yielding more potential opportunities or deals? Or is it time maybe to not pursue additional deals as the macro environment remains volatile? Nothing has changed in our strategy. We're focused, first and foremost, on organic growth and then growing through M&A, and then from there, dividend and share buybacks in that order. Clearly, there's been a little bit of a burst of the balloon in terms of some of the valuations, in particular, in the fintech world. That is -- that's a helpful characteristic of the environment right now. But I think we will continue to look for capabilities and management teams that would bring more value to Visa than we could bring to ourselves organically. And we're in constant evaluation of options. We have a very good corporate development team. It's something that Ryan and Vasant, in particular, spent a good deal of time on. And when we see something that we think will make us better as a company and has a fair value attached to it, we're not afraid to go after it. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Thanks for all the work and effort, Al, over time, and I wanted to address kind of a bigger picture question for you and maybe for Ryan, is that one of the questions we get a lot from investors is how do we think about kind of the challenges as we eventually reach some level of maturation of card penetration, especially in the U.S. and developed markets and especially given some of the preferences we've seen in other countries for them to develop domestic schemes or at least favor domestic schemes. So just wondering if you can provide a little bit of reflection on what we've seen, thus far, and maybe, Ryan, some ideas on how we should think about kind of maturation and expansion issues going forward. I'll start, and then certainly Ryan can add. First, I would say that I believe deeply that there is tremendous opportunity in the card -- traditional card world, both in the consumer space as well as in the B2B space. There are still hundreds and hundreds of millions of people to bring into the financial mainstream. There are still trillions of dollars spent on cash and check. And when you look in the B2B space, we see a total addressable market of about $120 billion across carded opportunities, cross-border and payables and receivables, where I talked a bunch about a number of examples that we have worked on over the course of the last quarter. RTP systems are helping to digitize money movement. That's a good thing. If you look at the disruption caused by monetization in India, it ended up being extraordinarily positive in terms of what it's done in terms of growth in card credentials as well as acceptance, which, by the way, I also should have said, in the traditional world, there's still a tremendous opportunity to grow our acceptance footprint from the level that it's at today.  These RTP systems are also helping us and we're leaning into them. They're helping us extend the reach of Visa Direct as we utilize them as part of our network-of-network strategies. They're helping us with open banking through Tink, where we can facilitate greater access to more developers on one end and more financial institutions on the other end. I think RTPs represent an opportunity for us to sell value-added services. And I still think the advantages of -- and the capabilities associated with the carded space are still far superior to account to -- account the consumer protections, et cetera. And if you look at Pix in Brazil, you look at UPI in India, these things developed and were put in the marketplace, and we're seeing a fair amount of -- hearing a lot from clients in terms of fraud associated with these networks. And in many ways, that makes sense. They haven't spent the decades and hundreds of millions of dollars that Visa has to build security, fraud capability, risk management capabilities that help keep the ecosystem secure and trusted by consumers. And I think we have the opportunity over time in the A2A space to bring some of those capabilities and earn some good revenue and yield from them. So Ryan, what would you add or delete? Not a lot to add to that, Al. It's great. I mean, James, just in short, we still see a ton of runway. We love our products. We love our people. We love our brand. We love our position and all these markets, whether they're mature or emerging around the world, so tons of runway. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Al, I just wanted to ask a question about how, when you look at the new business that you've won, let's say, in the past 12, maybe even 18 months or so, how that kind of sets Visa up as we think about the next -- I would say the next 2 years, not really much beyond that. But the question really here is, is it tilting to take advantage more of debit trends, credit trends, global hospitality. And I'm kind of asking because Mastercard kind of called it out this morning as their positioning in travel, and it sounds like you were also kind of hinting at some positioning for your business. So I would just be interested to know what that new business pipeline that you brought in suggests over the course of the next 2 years for your company. Well, I'd say a couple of things, Dan. Number one, on the travel front, it's been a focus for us for a long time. And I think we have about 650 co-brands around the world. Many of them are travel co-brands, and I think we're the leading co-brand player on the planet. I think that when I look around the world, there's certainly opportunities with traditional issuers. We've made a lot of inroads in markets like Brazil and Chile, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan over the past year. We've had some great renewals in the United States over the last couple of years from JPMorgan Chase to Wells to the ones I talked about today in terms of Bank of America, Cap One, Commerce Bank. But we've also made great inroads with fintechs and neobanks. We have had a great track record of wins in the last 24 to 36 months. And a lot of these people are getting to scale in their particular markets. And I think, for us, we have to have a wider lens in terms of who can provide services. We're trying to get our -- make sure we have -- get Visa cards in as many wallets as we can around the world. And then I'm going to come back to acceptance. One of the great ways to continue to grow our business is to grow our acceptance footprint, which still requires a lot of growth around the world. One of the places we've concentrated on that in the last 1.5 years is Latin America. And if you look at the ratio of spending in Latin America that went from -- moved from cash to PV in the last couple of years, back in full year 2020, only 46% of Latin America's volume was PV, with 54% being cash.  This past quarter, we just finished 59% of their PV -- [ 69% ] of their volume was purchase volume, so there was a 13-point swing in the Latin America region in the last not even quite 3 years. And that's a combination of winning with traditional FIs, winning with fintechs, having a localized market-by-market approach with a lot of good -- really good progress in countries in South -- in Latin America like Brazil and Chile. Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Al, best wishes to you, and we'll miss hearing from you on this call. Ryan, congratulations. Can you talk about how this growth strategy and organization have evolved under your leadership? Are you planning to focus more or less on certain things or do some things differently? And Vasant, very quickly, can you comment under your decel from your fourth fiscal quarter to 1Q? You talked about some of the dynamics. But how is that relative to your initial expectations? Harshita, I don't think we got the second half of your question, so maybe we can knock that off, and then Ryan can talk... [ I heard it ]. You did? I think you were asking about -- you said decel, I'm assuming you meant deceleration between the first and the second. Yes. Yes. I mean just a couple of things. The Russia impact is a little larger in the second quarter because we had almost 2 quarters' worth of service fees last year. Remember, we recognize service fees with a lag, so the service fees recognized in the first quarter were based on Q4 growth rates. So sequentially, Q1 was a little lower, so Q2 service fees will be impacted by that. Also, currency volatility is moderating as we speak. It has been moderating for a few weeks. And incentive growth is a little higher as you saw. So you put it all together. We were a little better than we expected. As you know, we thought we would be high single digits in the first quarter. We were higher for the reasons I mentioned, will be high single digits in the second quarter. That's our expectation right now. Ryan? Yes, on the first part of your question, I've been a President now for close to 10 years, so I've been shoulder to shoulder with Al and Vasant and the rest of our team as we've made all of our key decisions, as we've developed our strategy, as we've executed our strategy. So it probably won't or shouldn't surprise you, I'm going to continue to focus on the 3 growth pillars that we've laid out: consumer payments, new inflows and value-added services. And my priorities are going to be focused on doing everything that we can to accelerate our progress and accelerate our momentum. So how do we go to market? How do we work with clients? How do we ship product faster? How do we sell solutions more effectively to our clients and to part of your question, how do we organize? So earlier this month, I announced a new organizational structure that really reflects our strategy that we talked with all of you about all the time. And we believe it's going to help us accelerate our progress in all 3 of those growth factors. To give you a quick sketch of that, Oliver Jenkyn, long-time Visa veteran, who many of you know, is going to lead a new global markets organization that includes driving our consumer payments growth in all of our markets around the world. So our 5 regional presidents will report to Oliver. Chris Newkirk, who formerly led our strategy organization, is going to lead our new flows business unit, reporting directly to me. Antony Cahill, who is our former Deputy CEO of Europe, is going to lead our value-added services business unit, reporting directly to me. So our global markets team, our value-added services business unit, our new flows business unit all will report directly to me.  And then just to round that out a little bit, Jack Forestell, who also many of you know, will become our Chief Product and Strategy Officer and will partner closely with our President of Technology, Rajat Taneja. And the 2 of them are focused on delivering a robust product and innovation road map, shipping world-class products and services that help our clients grow their businesses and deepen their relationships with their customers. So that gives you a sense of where we are with strategy and the organization. Our next question comes from Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Congrats to Al and Ryan. I think you mentioned earlier that you're keeping the second half guidance unchanged. Can you just remind us what that guidance was from either a volume or a net revenue standpoint? Just because I think we have only the prior kind of full year guidance, and I know there's FX that's becoming less of a headwind as you get into the second half. Yes. When we talked to you last quarter, we said, for the full year, revenue growth would be somewhere in the mid-teens on a constant dollar basis adjusted for Russia. And then when you adjust for Russia and you adjust for a full year impact at that time of about 2 points on FX, it was going to be high single digits in nominal dollars. And so you know sort of where we are in Q1 and Q2. And exchange rates have moved around some, so you can do some of the math. We're basically not changing any views on the second half right now because trends have been still fairly stable. The only thing you might want to change is what the exchange rate impact in the second half might be based on where these are right now. I also gave you fairly clear operating expense expectations. We were about 15% growth in the first quarter. We said growth will be 2 to 3 points lower in nominal dollar terms in the second quarter, another 2 to 3 points lower in the third quarter and another 2 to 3 points lower in the fourth quarter. And that reflects what we had said last quarter. That is expense growth will moderate through the year, both as we moderate the rate of increase and also as we lap higher levels of expenses from last year. So those pretty much are the sort of the broad outlines of what we said last quarter. And then we'll update you once again on our next call with any changes we might have based on trends. Our final question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Congrats to Al and Ryan. Excited for both of you. On the renewal front and new deal front, I'll ask on that if you don't mind. Any call-outs on pricing contract requirements, that kind of thing? I know you'd named a bunch of big names on the renewal front. Mastercard talked about the Citizens win there. Just curious what's happening in the whole balance of trade area. Well, it's a competitive world out there, Tien-tsin, as you well know. I think that there's a price that you need to get to, and then a lot of it has to do with the combination of incumbency or not, the capabilities you have, what your lineup of customers' clients are in that market, what kind of experience you've had, what kind of innovative ideas you bring to the table, the other kinds of capabilities that we have in terms of services and new flows. So every deal is different and potentially hinges on  different things depending upon the needs of a particular client. And we tried to be very bespoke when we look at deals and talk to clients because their needs and their situation will always tend to be a bit different. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have additional questions, please feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. Thanks again, and have a great day. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."

         "Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our investor website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session.  Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. As such, it does involve risks and uncertainties. Our press release provides more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.  We've also provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures this quarter, and we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings release and earnings presentation include full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.  With that, let me turn things over to Pat. Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 revenue came in at the low end of guide and was impacted by persistent macro headwinds, which began in Q2 and underscored a 2022 characterized by unprecedented volatility, which will continue in the near term.  We made meaningful progress on several fronts in calendar year '22, notwithstanding all the challenges, but we readily admit our results and our Q1 guidance are below what we expected ourselves. We are working diligently to address the challenges brought on by current demand trends and remain confident in our long-term plans and trajectory.  Accordingly, we are even more aggressively executing on the cost measures we described in Q3 even as we keep the investments critical to our long-term transformation intact with a clear eye of making the right capital allocation decision to drive the most long-term value.  Today, I'd like to address 3 areas. One, our view on the macro and the markets in which we participate; two, the operational progress we made in 2022; three, as we enter the new year outlining the commitments we are making to all our stakeholders.  First, on the macro. We expect macro weakness to persist at least through the first half of the year with the possibility of second half improvements. However, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we are not going to provide revenue guidance beyond Q1. Dave will provide guidelines for capital spending, depreciation and adjusted free cash flow in his prepared comments.  Having said that, let me give you additional color regarding our view of our markets in 2023. To various degrees, all our markets are being impacted by macro uncertainty, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions in Europe and COVID impacts in Asia, especially in China.  In the PC market, we saw a further deterioration as we ended calendar year '22. In Q3, we provided an estimate for the calendar year '23 PC consumption TAM of 270 million to 295 million units. Given continued uncertainty and demand signals we see in Q1, we expect the lower end of that range is a more likely outcome. Near term, the PC ecosystem continues to deplete inventory.  For all of calendar year '22, our sell-in was roughly 10% below consumption with Q4 under-shipping meaningfully higher than full year, and Q1 expected to grow again to represent the most significant inventory digestion in our data set. While we know this dynamic will need to reverse, predicting one is difficult.  Importantly, PC usage data remains strong, reinforcing that use cases brought on by COVID are persistent even as the economy has reopened. And as we highlighted in our recent PC webinar, strong usage and installed base, which is roughly 10% higher than pre-COVID levels and what we see as a conservative refresh rate, supports a longer-term PC TAM of 300 million units plus or minus, post this period of adjustment.  We intend to capitalize on this TAM through a strong pipeline of innovation and based on the growing strength of our product portfolio, customers are increasingly betting on Intel. We grew share in the second half of '22, and we expect that positive momentum to continue in '23.  We remain clear eyed on managing to near-term weakness in PCs but we also see the enduring and increasing value PCs have in our daily lives.  In the server market, the overall consumption TAM grew modestly in calendar year '22, albeit at diminishing rates as the year progressed. Inventory burn drove server CPU shipments down mid-single digits year-on-year in calendar year '22 with hyperscale up, offset by declines in enterprise and Rest of World.  Our share in calendar year '22 was in line with our subdued expectations, and our revenue volatility was a function of TAM, especially given our outsized exposure to enterprise and China. We expect Q1 server consumption TAM to decline both sequentially and year-over-year at an accelerated rate with first half '23 server consumption TAM down year-on-year before returning to growth in the second half.  While all segments have weakened, enterprise and rest of world, especially China, continues to be weaker than hyperscale. However, we'd highlight that the correction in enterprise and rest of the world, where we have stronger positions, are further along than hyperscale.  Lastly, in our broad-based markets like industrial, auto and infrastructure, demand trends throughout calendar year '22 were strong but not completely immune to the macro volatility. Strong demand in these markets was mirrored by strong Q4 and record calendar year '22 revenue in NEX, PSG, IFS and Mobileye. We see calendar year '23 as another growth year for us in these areas even though the absolute rate is difficult to predict today.  This is in contrast to the semi market ex-memory, which third parties expect to decline low to mid-single digits. We entered 2023 with a view that much of the macro uncertainty of the last year is likely to persist, especially in the first half of the year. As such, we are laser-focused on executing to our $3 billion in calendar year '23 cost savings that we committed on our Q3 earnings call.  We are making tough decisions to right-size the organization and we further sharpened our business focus within our BUs by rationalizing product road maps and investments.  NEX continues to do well and is a core part of our strategic transformation, but we will end future investments in our network switching product line, while still fully supporting existing products and customers. Since my return, we have exited 7 businesses, providing in excess of $1.5 billion in savings.  We are also well underway to integrating AXG into CCG and DCAI, respectively, to drive a more effective go-to-market capability, accelerating the scale of these businesses while further reducing costs. While it was important to focus on what we are doing to address the current macro uncertainty, it is also important to highlight that despite disappointing financial results, calendar year '22 did see considerable progress towards our transformation. We remain fully committed to executing to our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Success starts with our people and execution follows culture.  In calendar year '22, we took important strides to rebuild the leadership team, promoting from within and adding fresh perspectives from the outside. This includes the Board of Directors with the addition of Lip-Bu Tan and Barbara Novick, both of whom have already made significant contributions and the appointment of Frank Yeary as Chair.  In addition, a year ago, we reestablished OKRs to drive accountability and transparency across the organization, and we reintroduced Tick-Tock 2 to establish a rigorous methodology of design and product development. Both are key spark plugs to our execution engine.  Rebuilding the culture has begun to show benefits in manufacturing and design. Our progress against our TD road map continue to improve throughout calendar year '22, and every quarter, our confidence grows. We are at/or ahead of our goal of 5 nodes in 4 years. Intel 7 is now in high-volume manufacturing for both client and server. On Intel 4, we are ready today for manufacturing, and we look forward to the Meteor Lake ramp in second half of the year.  Intel 3 continues to show great health and is on track. Intel 4 and 3 are our first modes deploying EUV, and will represent a major step forward in terms of transistor performance per watt and density.  On Intel 20A and Intel 18A, the first nodes to benefit from RibbonFETs and PowerVia, internal test chips and those of a major potential foundry customer have taped out with the silicon running in the fab. We continue to be on track to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025.  Progress in TD continues to be validated by our IFS pipeline. I am happy that we were able to add a leading cloud edge and data center solutions provider as a leading edge customer for Intel 3. Including prior customers, such as MediaTek, we now have lifetime deal value of greater than $4 billion for IFS.  We also have an active pipeline engagements with 7 out of the 10 largest foundry customers coupled with consistent pipeline growth to include 43 potential customers and ecosystem partner test chips. Additionally, we continue to make progress on Intel18A, and I've already shared the engineering release of PDK 0.5 with our lead customers and expect to have the final production release in the next few weeks.  In addition, we are working hard to complete the Tower acquisition, which will further amplify our momentum as our foundry business becomes even more compelling to customers.  On the product front, the PRQ of Sapphire Rapids in Q3 and the formal introduction of our fourth gen Xeon scalable CPU and Xeon CPU MAX series better known to many of you as U.S. Sapphire Rapids and Sapphire Rapids HBM, respectively, on January 10 was a great milestone. It was particularly satisfying to host a customer-centered events, including testimonials from Dell, Google Cloud, HPE, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA, among many others.  We are thrilled to be ramping production to meet a strong backlog of demand, and we are on track to ship 1 million units by midyear. In addition, as part of AXG moves into DCAI, it is noteworthy that our Intel Flex series, optimized for and showing clear leadership in media stream density and visual quality, is now shifting initial deployments with large CSPs and MNCs, enabling large-scale cloud gaming and media delivery deployments.  Our DCAI road map only improves from here and will ramp into sampling and has completed power on with top OEM and CSP customers, and it remains on track to launch in the second half of 2023. Granite Rapids, our next performance core addition to the Xeon portfolio, is on track to launch in 2024, running multiple operating systems across many different configurations.  Further, our first efficient core product, CR4, is also on track for 2024. Lastly, it is appropriate to continue to highlight PSG for its standout performance delivering record Q4 revenue up 42% year-on-year. We are planning to have a more fulsome look at our progress in DCAI at our next investor webinar later in Q1. Stay tuned for the invitation.  In CCG, we continue to build on our market share momentum across the PC stack by focusing on delivering leadership products with our broad, open ecosystem. I'm particularly pleased that our clear performance leadership at the high end drove record client ASPs in the quarter. In Q4, the 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family, codename, Raptor Lake, became available, starting with the desktop K processors and the Intel Z 790 chipset.  In partnership with ASUS, we officially set a new world record for overclocking, pushing the 13th Gen Intel Core past the 9 gigahertz barrier for the first time ever. Hands down, we provide desktop enthusiasts and gamers with the best processors and features for overclocking in the PC industry.  We also introduced our notebook Raptor Lake family at CES, including the world's fastest notebook CPU and the first 24 cores. We look forward to ramping the more than 300 mobile design wins we have already secured in the first half of '23.  Meteor Lake, our first disaggregated CPU built on Intel 4, remains on track for the second half of the year. And with Meteor Lake progressing well, it's now appropriate to look forward to Lunar Lake, which is on track for production readiness in 2024, having taped out its first silicon. Lunar Lake is optimized for ultra-low power performance, which will enable more of our PC partners to create ultrathin and light systems for mobile users. In addition, as we outlined on our webinar, we are excited by the strength of the Evo brand. The introduction of Unison for leadership multi-device experience as we ramp the more than 60 design wins and the uniqueness of vPro in the enterprise market, helping our customers drive an almost 200% return on investment by deploying vPro platforms to their end users.  Lastly, as consumer graphics reintegrate into CCG, enthusiasm for our latest Alchemist-based discrete graphics products continue to build and we expect volume ramp throughout the year.  Turning to NEX and Mobileye. Both businesses have performed well in Q4 and calendar year '22, partially insulated by some of the market forces impacting PCs and server, any exit key product milestones with Mount Evans, Raptor Lake P&S, and Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids to drive a second consecutive year of double-digit year-on-year growth in calendar year '22. We expect market share gains and outperformance to continue in '23.  Mobileye increased revenue by almost 60% year-on-year in Q4 and is on a solid growth path for calendar year '23. Calendar year '22 design wins, including SuperVision, are projected to generate future revenue of approximately $6.7 billion across 64 million units.  In addition, our manufacturing organization performed well throughout calendar year '22. Starting the year navigating the worst supply-constrained environment in over 20 years, only to have to pivot in Q2 to respond to rapidly changing demand signals, which are now driving near-term underloading in our factory network. More importantly, we continue to push forward with the next phase of IDM 2.0, creating an internal foundry evolving our systems business practices and culture to establish a leadership cost structure. This new approach is already gaining momentum internally.  As a reminder, the internal foundry model will place our BUs in a similar economic footing as external IFS customers and will allow our manufacturing group and BUs to be more agile, make better decisions and uncover efficiency and cost savings. We have identified 9 different subcategories for operational improvement that our teams will aggressively pursue.  In addition to establishing better incentives, this new approach will provide transparency on our financial execution, allowing us to better benchmark ourselves against other foundries and drive to best-in-class performance.  We'll also provide improved transparency to our owners as we expect to share full internal foundry P&L in calendar year '24. Ultimately, allowing you to better judge how we are allocating your capital and creating value.  We expect additional efficiencies as we implement our internal foundry model, which is a key element to accomplish our $8 billion to $10 billion of cost savings exiting 2025, as we outlined on our last call.  I want to remind everyone that we are on a multiyear journey. We remain focused on the things that are within our control as we navigate short-term headwinds while executing to our long-term strategy. While I remain sober that we have a long way to achieve our financial expectations, I am pleased with the transformation progress that we are making.  I can tell you, in addition to obviously focusing on the day-to-day running of the company, we continue to examine numerous additional value-creating initiatives for 2023 as we always do. We will update you as we move along on any we deem appropriate.  Rest assured, we remain committed to creating value for our owners and to delivering the long-term strategic road map we laid out at the beginning of this journey, and we are confident in our ability to do so. We will: one, deliver on 5 nodes in 4 years, achieving process performance parity in 2024 and unquestioned leadership by 2025 with Intel 18A; two, execute on an aggressive Sapphire Rapids ramp, introduced Emerald Rapids in second half '23 and Granite Rapids and CR4s in 2024; three, ramp Meteor Lake in second half '23 and PRQ Lunar Lake in 2024; and four, expand our IFS customer base to include large design wins on Intel 16, Intel 3 and 18A this year.  We also need to improve our cost structure and drive operational efficiency. On this front, we will: one, return to profitability and deliver the benefits of our calendar year '23, '24 and '25 efforts to reduce costs and drive efficiencies; two, execute on our internal foundry P&L by 2024; and three, expand on the use of our smart capital strategy to leverage multiple pools of capital, including SCIPs and chips in the U.S. and Europe to balance our long-term capacity aspirations with near-term realities.  Before I turn it over to Dave, I'm going to close by saying we take our commitments to all our stakeholders extremely seriously and, ultimately, we strive to create value for each of them. For our customers, it is rebuilding our execution engine to provide a predictable cadence of best-in-class products to support their ambitions.  For our employees, it is to provide them with the opportunity to develop and bring to market world-changing technologies. It is what inspires each of us inside of the company.  For our external owners, it is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions around capital allocation, which drives the highest return on investment we make with your capital. Our ambitions are equaled by our passion, and our efforts across manufacturing, design, products and foundry are well on their way to driving our transformation and creating the flywheel, which is IBM 2.0. Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. We saw solid business execution in the fourth quarter despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds impacting the semiconductor industry. As Pat indicated, we expect challenging macro conditions to continue through at least the first half of the year. As outlined last quarter, we'll continue to prioritize investments critical to our transformation, prudently and aggressively managed expenses near term and drive fundamental improvements in our cost structure longer term. We're executing well towards our $3 billion target in 2023 and $8 billion to $10 billion exiting '25. Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, landing at the low end of our range and down 8% sequentially. Revenue from DCAI and NEX were in line with expectations, while CCG was impacted by softening demand for PCs. Gross margin for the quarter was 44%, slightly better than we had expected for the low end of our revenue range. Q4 gross margins were impacted 220 basis points from factory underload charges offsetting a sequential 170 basis point benefit from an insurance settlement. EPS for the quarter was $0.10. $0.10 below our guide on lower revenue and increased inventory reserves. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $7.7 billion. Net CapEx was $4.6 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $3.1 billion and we paid dividends of $1.5 billion. We finished FY '22 with revenue of $63.1 billion, gross margin of 47.3% and EPS of $1.84. We generated $15.4 billion of cash from operations and an adjusted free cash flow of approximately negative $4 billion at the low end of the range we provided last quarter, despite approximately $3 billion of capital incentives that shifted from Q4 into 2023. When we spoke at Investor Day last February, we forecasted revenue of $76 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1 billion to $2 billion for FY '22. As macroeconomic conditions deteriorated at a rapid pace in second half of '22, we committed to optimizing the areas of the business within our control. Through reductions in spending and significant working capital improvements, we offset a $13 billion reduction to revenue expectations to come within $2 billion of our initial adjusted free cash flow guide, while still making the needed capital investments in support of our IDM 2.0 strategy, and to position ourselves for long-term growth in a market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investment balances of more than $28 billion, modest leverage and a strong investment-grade profile. Moving to fourth quarter business unit results. CCG revenue was $6.6 billion, a decline of 36% year-over-year as PC TAM deteriorated faster than expected due to macroeconomic headwinds. Customer inventory remains elevated beyond our previous expectations and will continue to burn into the first half of '23. CCG realized record CPU ASPs, up 11% year-over-year as we continue to see relative strength in our premium segments driven by leadership performance and attractive features of our Evo and vPro platforms. Q4 operating profit was $0.7 billion, down year-over-year on lower revenue and increased Intel 7 product mix. DCAI revenue was $4.3 billion in Q4, up 2% sequentially with higher ASPs offsetting demand softness and down 33% year-over-year driven by TAM contraction and competitive pressure. DCAI operating profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million. While still unsatisfactory, profit was up more than $350 million sequentially on reduced factory costs. Operating profit was down substantially year-over-year, impacted by lower revenue, increased advanced node start-up costs and higher product costs. Within DCAI, PSG achieved record Q4 revenue, up 42% year-over-year, along with record full year revenue, up 29% year-over-year through increased ASPs, improved external supply and strength in the infrastructure segment. PSG enters 2023 with still significant unfulfilled backlog. NEX quarterly revenue was $2.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year as declining global GDP impacted the Edge business, offsetting growth in Xeon network CPUs and the ramp of our Mount Evans infrastructure processing unit. Despite second half macro headwinds, NEX set another full year record revenue at $8.9 billion up 11% year-over-year and marking consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth. Operating profit was $58 million in the fourth quarter, down year-on-year on mix shift to lower-margin segments and higher factory start-up costs. AXG achieved record quarterly revenue of $247 million, up 34% sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year, supported by the launch of Sapphire Rapids HBM. Operating loss was $441 million, down $63 million sequentially, with inventory valuations negatively impacted by softer demand, especially for crypto processors. Mobileye delivered another record revenue quarter of $565 million, up 26% sequentially and growth of more than $200 million and 59% year-over-year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion was also a record for Mobileye, growing 35% year-over-year. Fourth quarter operating income of $210 million represents 71% growth year-over-year. IFS achieved record quarterly revenue of $319 million, up 87% sequentially and 30% year-over-year on increased automotive shipments. Operating loss was $31 million, a $72 million improvement sequentially on higher revenue. We continue to reshape the company to drive to world-class product costs and operational efficiency. We remain committed to the $3 billion of '23 cost savings outlined on our Q3 earnings call, while mindfully protecting the investments needed to accelerate our transformation and ensure we are well positioned for long-term market growth. Before turning to Q1 guidance, let me take a moment to discuss an accounting change that will impact our results beginning in the first quarter. Effective January 23, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. This change better reflects the demonstrated economic value of our machinery and equipment over time and is more aligned with the business model changes inherent to our IDM 2.0 strategy. The growth of the IFS deal pipeline will extend the life of manufacturing nodes beyond what was practical within IDM 1.0. Disaggregated CPU architecture allows performance and cost optimization for each chiplet, better leveraging older nodes. And we are optimizing our core business around more sustainable capacity quarters to improve equipment utilization and maximize ROIC. The change will be applied prospectively beginning Q1 '23. When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of '22, we expect total depreciation expense in '23 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion. An approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expense and a $1.2 billion decrease in ending inventory values. This change will not be counted towards the $3 billion short-term or $8 billion to $10 billion long-term structural cost improvements we committed last quarter, and is intended to provide the most accurate reflection of company financial results to our owners. Now turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect first quarter revenue of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. In addition to continued macro headwinds, we expect customers will burn inventory at a meaningfully faster pace than the prior few quarters in response to macro TAM softness impacting CCG, DCAI, NEX lines of business. We see potential for market conditions to improve faster than typical seasonality as third-party data shows macro headwinds easing in the second half of the year. While we're progressing toward a $3 billion spending reduction with significant austerity across the company, given the fixed cost nature of our business, we expect the sequential revenue decline will result in negative operating margin in the first quarter. We're forecasting gross margin of 39%, a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.15 at the midpoint of revenue guidance, inclusive of $350 million to $500 million of operating margin benefit from the useful life accounting change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to OpEx. Factory underload charges are projected to impact Q1 gross margin by 400 basis points. We continue to evaluate all investments and will remain laser-focused on optimizing for ROI, adjusting for market conditions across operating expenses and capital assets. While we're not providing guidance beyond Q1, I'll touch on a few elements of our outlook. At Investor Day, we noted that during the investment phase of IDM 2.0, from 2022 through 2024, our model was to operate at approximately 35% net capital intensity. For FY '23, despite the lower revenue level, we expect to be at or below the 35% model. Embedded in our assumptions are capital offsets of around 20% to 30% of growth CapEx including our innovative SCIP partnership with Brookfield. We expect FY '23 operating expenses of under $20 billion, a roughly 10% year-over-year decline, consistent with committed cost-cutting measures totaling $2 billion, adjusting for the depreciation change. Adjusted free cash flow will be below our Investor Day guide of approximately neutral in the first half of '23 and return back towards guardrails in second half '23. In closing, we remain committed to the strategy and long-term financial model we laid out at Investor Day last year. The opportunity for strong revenue growth across our business unit portfolio and free cash flow at 20% of revenue remains. While we're not satisfied with near-term results, this market downturn represents an opportunity to accelerate the transformation necessary to achieve our long-term goals. I look forward to providing updates on our transformation journey as the year progresses. With that, let me turn the call back over to John. Thank you, Dave. We will now move into the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Let me ask a question. I guess Dave, to hit on some of the revenue questions or items you just said, do you expect the first quarter to be the bottom in absolute dollars through the year? And any color between the segments? It seems like it's exceedingly a CCG problem right now in the quarter. Or is it broader than that? Yes. So you want to go first? Okay. So let me -- I'll start, and Pat is going to add some color. So on the $11 billion, we're expecting most of the business units to be down sequentially, double digits. We're not going to provide guidance for the rest of the year. But I did say that the first half is likely to be seeing these inventory corrections. The other thing I would just add, is maybe color to kind of position the year, is that we're expecting Q1 to be the most significant inventory decline at our customers that we've seen in recent history. So it's -- if you look back over the last 4 or 5 quarters of reduction, this will be meaningfully higher than all of those quarters. So obviously, that is impacting the Q1 outlook. Yes. And clearly, as we look at Q1, affected by macro significant inventory adjustments, and that's affecting clearly clients but also data center as well. And we do see that year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter data center to be down as well. And we think that's a macro statement across all segments, across cloud, enterprise, government and uniquely China. Part of our more positive expectation for the second half of the year is clearly from our customers and what we've heard from them but also we expected some level of recovery from China as well. So overall, clearly, a major inventory correction cycle and coming after back-to-school and how they refresh our customers clearly wanting to take more aggressive steps as they adjust. But that inventory adjustment is well below their sell-out rates. So for that, we do believe that we will see recovery as they have made those inventory adjustments, and we'll see the business be stronger as we go through the year. Ross, do you have a follow-up? I do. Quickly, Dave, I want to pivot to the gross margin side of things, excluding the change in the depreciable life side of the equation, I know revenue is the biggest headwind right now. But you had talked at the Investor Day last year about a 51% to 53% gross margin range and kind of you want to operate within those bands. What does it take to get back to that? Is there a revenue level? Do you have to be above $17 billion, $18 billion? Are there offsets? Any sort of framework you can give to give investors confidence that -- we never thought we'd see a 3 handle on your gross margin. And so we really want to know what it's going to take to get back to a 5 handle, and if that's significantly changed from the last framework that you provided us. Yes, good question. So obviously, revenue is the most significant impact to gross margins. We obviously did not expect to be down at these levels. That said, it's a function of some significant inventory burn. So it's not necessarily a reflection of the demand in the market. So obviously, we would expect that to corroborate at some point, which will be a significant lift to the gross margins. The other thing is, in the first quarter, we're going to have about a 400 basis point impact on our gross margins just from underloading because of the demand softness. And we would expect loadings to improve once we get past the inventory correction we're currently experiencing. In addition to that, we have a number of initiatives underway to improve gross margins, and we're well underway. When you look at the $3 billion reduction that we talked about for '23, $1 billion of that is in cost of sales, and we're well underway on our way to getting that $1 billion. And then when you click it further into the $8 billion to $10 billion that we want to hit by the end of 2025, about 66% of that, 2/3 of that is cost of sales improvement. And we're getting a lot of that from our internal foundry model that Pat mentioned. We're already seeing significant opportunities to be efficient, more efficient between our business units and our factories. And I think we'll have a lot of things to say over the course of this year about areas that we see meaningful improvement. Also, we have smart capital that was modest in '22, it's going to be more significant in '23 and much of that smart capital does translate to a better cost structure for us that will help gross margin. So net of that, I feel very confident we will get back to 51% to 53% in the medium term. And in the long term, I feel very confident we will get back to 54% to 58%. And I think Pat said it in the past, we aim to beat that range. Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please? And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. I'm curious, how many weeks of DC microprocessor inventory is still in the channel. I'm trying to understand whether the demand assumptions are not what they should be, right? Or is it the supply assumptions? So when you say that the consumption this year will be $270 million, right, which is the low end, how do we know that for sure? What if the consumption rate is much lower than that? So just how many weeks of DC microprocessor inventory is there? And do you think Q1 is that clearing quarter? Or you think even in Q2 you could be shipping below consumption levels? So overall, as we said, we saw the range 270 million, 295 million. We believe the sell-through rate will be to the lower end of that. The consumption that we saw in Q4 was well below that and the consumption rate or the sell-in rate in Q1 is even more significantly almost 2x more significant below the consumption rate. Obviously, these are the macro effects that we can't predict, and that's what's taken us a bit more to the low end of the range. But clearly, as we've been working with our customers and channel partners, we've been monitoring very carefully the sellout that they've seen. So we're pretty comfortable with that range. Also, we would point to China and a very unique circumstance there, as is well known. And we do expect that there'll be some level of economic recovery there, particularly we forecasted in the second half of the year. And this is a topic that we continue to work closely with our customers. That said, overall, and as we updated on our PC webinar, we do expect that the long-term market is in the 300 million unit range. So as we overcome this inventory adjustment cycle, and some of this near-term economic. And I think as you heard from Microsoft, PC usage is up, the number of hours per PC continues to be up. The installed base has gone up. So all of those factors give us reasonable confidence that post this period of inventory correction that will have a very healthy 300 million unit plus or minus market that we're selling into. Vivek, do you have a follow-up question? Yes. Second question is on the data center. Historically, the semiconductor market likes incumbency, and there is only a share shift if and when the incumbent messes up. And right now, your competitor seems to be becoming a larger incumbent in a lot of cloud deployments, doesn't seem to be messing up. Doesn't it make it harder to displace them? I'm just curious at what edge do you think Intel has to change the status quo of share shift in cloud server? Do you think your design will get noticeably better? Is it architecture? Is it manufacturing? What helps you specifically to change this current momentum of share shift in cloud servers, specifically? Yes. Thank you. And I think the most important thing is what we just did with Sapphire Rapids, right? Our customers were anxious for a great product from Intel. Obviously, we would have liked it to be earlier as we had initially estimated, but we are now shipping a very high-quality product with significant areas of leadership in areas like AI performance, power performance, security feature function, high-performance computing workflows that are 5x the competition and features in areas like confidential computing and security that are quite differentiated from anything in the marketplace. Obviously, share shift, right, particularly in the data center space, these designs were 1 a year ago, right, or 2 years ago. And so it takes some amount of time. And against that, we're seeing a very strong outlook for Sapphire Rapids ramp through the year, as I said, 1 million units in the middle of the year. So very strong demand from our customers. And the other thing, as we've indicated, is have we rewon our customers' confidence that they could bet on our road map. And then we'll ramp it looking very healthy for later this year. Granite Rapids and CR4 is looking very healthy for next year. And all of those, I believe, are rebuilding our customers' confidence. And I believe with that, given the massive incumbency that Intel has, and I would just emphasize that even though we have seen the share shift in recent sell-in, the installed base is Intel, right? There's an enormous on some -- many of the cloud customers, 95-plus percent of their installed base is Intel. That gives us a very strong incumbency that we get to renew as we rebuild our customers' confidence. So as you put all of those things together, yes, we realize that we stumble, right? We lost share. We lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year, and we're going to be building a road map that allows us to regain leadership for the long term in this critical market. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Dave, I had a question on CapEx. I know you don't want to guide for the full year, but you did say that 20% to 30% of the gross CapEx, whatever the number is this year is going to be offsets. I know you don't have a lot of visibility on the chips money you're going to get. But it seems like best case, revenue is going to be in the mid-50s roughly. And if I take a little less than 35% of that, because you said that it's still going to be 35% or less, that will be the net CapEx intensity. And I sort of divide the numbers, it implies a gross CapEx number, something in the range of $20 billion, give or take. Can you sort of help us just handicap that number? Yes. So let me see if I can -- obviously, we're trying to avoid guiding beyond the first quarter given the murkiness. I would just say we are very focused on the appropriate level of investment necessary for the long-term strategy of IDM 2.0 while being very thoughtful around how much CapEx we spend to manage our free cash flow. I think Smart Capital offsets will be pretty healthy this year, much better than last year. Partly, that's because we'll be fully along with SCIPs 1 with our partnership with Brookfield. We are expecting grant incentives to be a part of this year's Smart capital offsets. And so those -- and then lastly, we do have already in place the investment tax credit, which could have some benefit to us this year. So certainly, Smart capital will be healthy, but we are being very prudent around our gross capital spend through the year. And we'll -- as we kind of progress through the year, we'll see how things develop, and we'll -- you can expect us to manage it accordingly. I think most importantly, we did not expect to be at this revenue level, obviously, for '23 when we talked about this net CapEx intensity of 35%. And yet we still maintain the discipline to stay at or below that 35% for the year. And I think that's what investors should take away from that message. Yes. Also, I'd just add, we do -- and Dave sort of implied it, but we do expect to do SCIP 2 this year as well, which is another source and also the credit center clearly there's motivation on the part of commerce to get that underway and the rules making in place in the near future and start to dispense funds this year. Also, I'd point to Europe as well. So it's EU chips as well as U.S. chip. So all of those efforts are part of Smart capital for us. We do believe that we'll have the capital necessary to meet both our near-term but more importantly, the strategic long-term investments. And that's what we say we're on track with IDM 2.0. We're on track with the capital, the builds that allow us to restore leadership in our process technology as well as have the factory capacity to both deliver that for our products as well as for our foundry customers. Tim, do you have a follow-up? I do, John. Dave, can you just sort of walk through maybe some of the gross margin puts and takes. I know that, again, you don't want to guide for the full year. But can you just help us think about what some of the puts and takes might be? I mean obviously, as volumes grow, that will help gross margin. But are there any other puts and takes that you would sort of call out for us? Yes. I think clearly, revenue is going to be the most significant driver of gross margins. We're a high-fixed cost model. So we suffer the consequence of that, obviously, when revenue is declining, but we also get the benefit when revenue is expanding. And so what will -- what is currently a headwind does turn to a tailwind as the business recovers. The second most significant impact we have is the underload charges. So that's 400 basis points or so this quarter. And we'll make a determination as to what loading makes sense for the second quarter as we get closer to the second quarter. But we're doing this to be appropriate in terms of our management of cash flow. But again, as business conditions adjust, we will start loading the fab at a higher rate, and that will improve gross margins. I think beyond that, it really is around a lot of the cost initiatives we have underway. It's the $3 billion for 2023, and it's the $8 billion to $10 billion improvement over the course of the next few years that really will help drive the costs and drive the gross margins beyond just revenue and loadings. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Another question on CapEx. I guess bigger picture, can you kind of speak to your CapEx philosophy in a slower demand environment? Is it finding the right number to fit a free cash flow model? Or are you looking at kind of your overall demand picture and saying, we need x minus y wafer starts, and that's why we can spend less? Would love to get a sense of how kind of the slowdown here is potentially changing or potentially not your strategy of spending. And if it's not, is it just simply delaying investments into '24 and '25? Yes. Thanks, C.J. I'll start and ask Dave to jump in. We sort of think about the capital budget with 2 lenses in mind, right? One is the strategic lens. Am I going to get back to leadership at 20A and 18A? Yes, am I going to make the capital investments required to do that? Absolutely. To some degree, do we scrub those? Could we look hard at those? Where can we save tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on those. Yes, we will. But we're not going to diminish from the capital required for strategic leadership for the long term. So strategic capital, largely unchanged. The second bucket, of course, I'll just call it, capacity capital, right, and adjusting to the near-term ebb and flows of the business requirement. And obviously, in this macro environment, that's been adjusted meaningfully downward and we're finding everywhere we can to squeeze our existing capacity more effectively to be more aggressive in terms of how we work with our equipment suppliers in those areas and doing everything we can to minimize the capital that's required for capacity-driven requirements as well. And that's where the larger trade-offs have been. And of course, in a business as large as ours, we have labs and buildings and everything else. We are scrubbing those like crazy as you would want us to. Dave, what else would you add? You took one of mine. Obviously, the OpEx area, yes, is an area that we've really focused on and Pat mentioned the lab piece, which is an area -- one of the areas that we have found efficiency. And I guess the last thing is that we have seen our capital offsets be higher than our original expectation. We were planning for probably 1/3 of what we think we'll get in 2023 when we announced our Smart capital initiative in -- at the Analyst Day. So that's obviously coming in stronger. Of course, Pat already alluded to the fact that a lot of that is -- SCIP has turned out to be a pretty powerful tool, and this will enable us to do a SCIP 2 this year as well, which obviously helps. C.J., do you have a follow-up? I do, a quick one. And again, I know you don't want to guide the full year, but as you kind of look at different scenario analysis for 2023, how do you see kind of return to positive free cash flow playing out? Is that something that could come in the second half? Or that's really in '24 of that? Well, '23, we were thinking was kind of a breakeven free cash flow year for us back at the Analyst Day last February. Obviously, in the first half of this year, we're going to be below that model. But as we look into the back half of the year, we would expect to approach the model in '23. And of course, '24 is a bit away from where we are right now, but this is the thing that we spend a lot of time on. I would tell you one thing, if you look at our free cash flow for '22, we came in roughly around minus $4 billion. If you remember, in the quarter before, we forecasted that we would be somewhere between minus $2 billion and minus $4 billion. We were actually assuming a higher level of capital offsets, which is still coming, but pushed into '23. And yet we still hit the high end of that range. And the way we did it was through working capital initiatives. So this is a big part of our strategy around managing free cash flow is more attention to working capital.  It's something that I think in the past may not have been a big focus here, but is a very big focus here. It's how we -- how our shipments are managed in terms of linearity, how we manage payments, how we manage our inventory. The fact that we're taking underload does affect the gross margins, but it also improves our cash flow because we're spending less on variable costs. So these are areas that we think can be pretty beneficial to us and be a tailwind for us in terms of free cash flow as we progress through the year. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Dave, the first question I get a lot is just with the challenges that you just mentioned at C.J.'s question on free cash flow. And I guess, well done to you and your team of extracting as much cash as you did out of working capital in the quarter. But I get questions about the security of the dividend all the time. And maybe that's a Board-level decision, but maybe you and Pat can address it a bit. Is that -- the current levels of dividend, is that sort of a sacrosanct thing at Intel in your current operating plan? Are there discussions around it either way? Don't shoot the messenger, it's a question I get a ton. Yes. Well, obviously, we announced a $0.365 dividend for the first quarter. That was consistent with the last quarter's dividend. I'd just say the Board, management, we take a very disciplined approach to the capital allocation strategy, and we're going to remain committed to being very prudent around how we allocate capital for the owners. And we are committed to maintaining a competitive dividend. Matt, do you have a follow-up question? Yes. I guess as my follow-up question, guys, I wanted to dig into the DCAI business a little bit. And you guys talked about, I think, the PSG or Altera being up, I don't know, 40-odd percent year-over-year, which if you just kind of rough math, it means that the core cloud plus enterprise server business is down 40%, something like that. And so maybe, Pat, could you walk us through what -- is that roughly right in terms of math and just where your -- how you see share loss versus ASP versus weakness in the markets in China and enterprise? Just how do you break that down for us, what operationally is happening in the server share space. Yes. So PSG did have a very good quarter, has a very strong backlog, continues to grow. But I'd say the math that you suggest is quite incorrect given the relative size of those businesses. So we'll happily offline talk a little bit more through that. That said, we did -- we grew less than the market last year and saw some share loss. We see that stabilizing this year. The key factor is better products, right? And we've just released that with Sapphire Rapids and getting great response and our announcement event on January 10 was a customer-centric ramps baby product line. We had strong participation from all the CSPs, all of the OEMs, all of the ISVs, end users. So it was seen as a very strong event. This year will be very much about ramping that and we'll see the improvements in both market share position as well as ASPs as we ramp that product through the year, and the confidence in the road map. And that will be the determinant, okay, you have a better product now, great. Customers are building it on an installed base. But do we have confidence in your long term? So I'd say we've reestablished a very credible road map. You'll see lots of news coming from us this year as we start delivering on samples, et cetera, of the next-generation products as well as the continued ramp of Sapphire Rapids with highly differentiated features and capabilities. So we feel like we've put the worst behind us, right? And we're now coming back to the front foot in this business area. And I'll say in a very customer-centric ISV-centric way, that delivers our customers the use cases that they need in their business. And our next question comes from the line of Toshi Hari from Goldman Sachs. Pat, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the demand environment in DCAI across cloud, enterprise and perhaps your comms customers. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the inventory correction in enterprise being ahead of cloud. So do those comments kind of imply that going forward, cloud could -- the demand there could moderate or decline as we progress through the year? Or if you can expand on that, that would be helpful. Great. Great. Thank you, Toshi. The -- what we said clearly that we did see demand softening through the year in data center overall. That's a market statement. Obviously, we have more exposure to enterprise in China, which we believe weakened our position a little bit more in the year, but we're seeing those same characteristics now with the cloud providers as well. So we see all of them weaker in the first half of the year. We are, I'll say, a touch optimistic that China will come back and enterprise will come back more rapidly than the cloud. And with our stronger exposure in those segments, we believe that is a potential good news for us as we go through the year relative to competition. The networking space is one where we have very sustained leadership and strength in areas like vRAN and O-RAN, are ones that our platform is dramatically better than competitors. And with that strong market share through the year, we also expect some level of softening there in those in the networking area, but not as much as some of the other segments that we would have. First half of the year, we expect to be down year-on-year in the second half of the year to returning to growth. So inventory adjustments, a weaker market in first half, recovery in the second half of the year is what we expect. Overall, and obviously, the relative position, we believe, that we have is stabilizing and the markets that we're stronger in, we're optimistic that they'll come back a little bit stronger as we go through the year. Toshi, do you have a follow-up? I do. Pat, you also talked about your focus and commitment toward value creation, you mentioned how you guys are pulling future investments from the switching business. As you look across your portfolio as of today. I think to your point, you've done quite a lot since coming back. Like where is the incremental opportunity as you think about improving the portfolio going forward and creating value? Yes. And I'll just say here without being too specific, some of these things are under evaluation, discussion with customers and the best way to handle it. We're doing a thorough analysis across the portfolio. And I would say we are looking at every aspect of the portfolio, where we're getting good returns, where we're not. And we're making decision after decision to optimize the portfolio. And as you say, we haven't been hesitant to make those decisions inside the back. And we have a few more that we're looking carefully at. But we're also looking at every area of the business. Dave suggested in his comments, \"Hey, can we do a better job with our lineups? Could we do a better job with our building assets?\" We've also discussed, as part of the internal foundry model, that we're making major steps to improve our automation and ERP efficiency to run the company more. Some of our people actions, we've been very scrutinizing and benchmarking ourselves against best-in-class in every aspect of how we run the business. So one by one, we're saying we're going to be world-class as measured by benchmarks in these areas and all the business areas that we're in, we believe they're strategically important and yielding good results with our shareholders' investments. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Wonder if you could talk about the reception you're seeing with Sapphire Rapids. And in particular, it seems like it's a really good chip. But I think the price at the platform level is getting more expensive, DDR5 is more expensive. What's it like right now migrating to a more expensive platform and environment or budgets are under pressure, does that change the ramp relative to other CPUs that you have? Yes. Thanks, Joe. And you are touching on a very important issue, the memory. And obviously, the memory pricing for DDR4 has collapsed, right? And it -- making that pricing gap versus DDR5 very visible currently. That said, customers don't buy these platforms on memory prices. They buy them on TCO, right? The total cost of the operations, right, that they get for the performance as they put them into operations. So memory price is one piece of that. But I'd also say DDR prices are expected to decline as we go through DDR5 price and the gap to DDR4 is widely forecast to decline, and that gap will diminish as we go through the year. However, right, you contrast that to the significant performance capability. And in some areas like AI, we're seeing 5x to 6x performance benefits. And when you put that into a TCO calculation, it's overwhelmingly positive. Security is not measured on TCO. It's measured on absolute statements of security and confidential computing. So overall, we are driving this ramp very aggressively through the year. We have strong demand of customers. We're ramping our factories quickly. And we do believe that we'll have a strong ramp of the Sapphire Rapids platform as we go through the year. Joe, do you have a quick follow-up? Yes. I also just wanted to touch on -- I mean you mentioned the migration of the ASG business into DCAI and CCG. Is that -- is there a change there in any of the priorities? Or is it just kind of a restructuring of where those businesses reside? Yes. It's a restructuring of where the businesses reside and as we move past this, I'll say, launch phase of those products. And we're now into the scale phase of those product lines. And for instance, discrete graphics, driving the attach rate and channel motions with our enormous client business. In the data center, bringing a broader portfolio across HPC, our Flex product line, the AI capabilities that we have that we're uniquely delivering through data center. So all of this is about is the efficiency and scale of those business areas. And we've been having numerous discussions with our customers about these changes, and they have been very well received. And I'd say all the products that we launched out of AXG, the Flex product line, the discrete graphics product line, the MAX product lines. All of those products are continuing forward, and we believe all of those will have strong ramps in their volumes revenues and market impact as we go through the year. So with that, let me just wrap up our time together. First, thank you. We're grateful for you joining us today, the opportunity that you've given us to update you on our business. And clearly, the financials aren't what we would hope for. But we're also pleased with the execution progress we made. And as a result, we're confident in the strategic outlook that we have for our business. The macro is difficult. It was difficult in Q4. We expect it to remain difficult as we go through the first half of the year, but we're laser-focused on controlling the things that we can. And every aspect of our execution, cost management and transformation is in our hands and we are well underway in executing against those paths. So with that, we look forward to seeing many of you throughout the quarter, updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

         "Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead. Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick Green, General Manager of Investor Relations; our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me.  Also listening in today is Jake Spiering, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations, who will assume this position effective March 1. Jake and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of months. It's been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last 2 years. Thank you for your questions, feedback and investment in Chevron.  We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I will turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron had an outstanding year in 2022, delivering record financial performance, producing more traditional energy and advancing lower carbon businesses.   Free cash flow stood a record, beating our previous high in 2021 by more than $15 billion, enabling a strong dividend increase and the buyback of almost 4% of our shares.   U.S. production was also our highest ever led by double-digit growth in the Permian. Growth matters when it's profitable. Return on capital employed over 20% shows that our focus on capital efficiency is delivering results.   And we took important steps in building new energy businesses. We successfully integrated REG's people and assets into Chevron, combining the best of both companies' technical and commercial capabilities. And we acquired rights to pore space for potential carbon capture and storage projects in Texas and Australia.   We had many other highlights last year, to name just a few, at TCO, project construction is largely complete, and we're starting up the fuel gas system. Focus is on commissioning and start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project by the end of this year to begin transition of the field from high to low pressure.   We announced a significant new gas discovery offshore Egypt, which could build on our growing natural gas position in the Eastern Med.   And our affiliate CPChem reached FID for 2 world-scale ethylene and derivative projects in Texas and Qatar.   2022 was a dynamic year with unique macroeconomic and geopolitical forces disrupting economies and industries around the globe. These events remind us of the importance of affordable and reliable energy with a lower carbon intensity over time.   We don't know what's ahead in 2023. I do know that Chevron's approach will be clear and consistent, focused on capital, cost and operational discipline with the objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials. Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $6.4 billion or $3.33 per share. Adjusted earnings were $7.9 billion or $4.09 per share. Included in the quarter were $1.1 billion in write-offs and impairments in our international upstream segment, and negative foreign currency effects over $400 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.   Record operating cash flows in combination with continued capital efficiency, resulted in over $37 billion of free cash flow in 2022. The only other year Chevron's operating cash flow exceeded $40 billion was 2011. Free cash flow in that year was less than 40% of this year's record.   In 2022, Chevron delivered outstanding results on all 4 of its financial priorities. Announcing earlier this week another 6% increase in our dividend per share, positioning 2023 to be the 36th consecutive year with annual dividend payout increases, investing within its organic budget despite cost inflation. Inorganic CapEx totaled $1.3 billion nearly 80% for new energy investments.   Paying down debt in every quarter and ending the year with a 3% net debt ratio, returning record annual cash to shareholders through buybacks and exiting the year with an annual repurchase rate of $15 billion.   Two days ago, Chevron's Board of Directors authorized a new $75 billion share repurchase program. Now is a good time to look back on our execution of the prior programs. Over the past nearly 2 decades, we bought back shares in more than 3 out of every 4 years, returning more than $65 billion to shareholders. And we've done it below the market average price during the whole time period.   Going forward with the new program, our intent is the same, be a steady buyer of our shares across commodity cycles. With a breakeven Brent price around $50 per barrel to cover our CapEx and dividend and with excess balance sheet capacity, we're positioned to return more cash to shareholders in any reasonable oil price scenario.   Turning to the quarter. Adjusted earnings were down nearly $3 billion compared with last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower realizations and liftings as well as higher exploration expense, partially offset by favorable timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining and chemicals margins and negative timing effects partially offset with higher sales volumes following third quarter turnarounds.   The Other segment charges increased mainly due to accruals for stock-based compensation.   For the full year, adjusted earnings increased more than $20 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted upstream earnings were up primarily due to increased realizations. Other items include higher exploration expenses, higher incremental royalties and production taxes due to higher prices, partially offset by favorable tax benefits and other items.   Downstream adjusted earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower chemical earnings and higher maintenance and turnaround costs.   2022 production was in line with guidance after adjusting for higher prices. As a reminder, Chevron's share of production is lower under certain international contracts when actual prices are higher than assumed in our guidance. Reserves replacement ratio was nearly 100% with the largest net additions in the Permian, Israel, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Higher prices lowered our share of proved reserves by over 100 million barrels of oil equivalent.   2023 production is expected to be flat to up 3% at $80 Brent. After adjusting for lower prices and portfolio changes, primarily the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and the expiration of a contract in Thailand, we expect production to grow led by the Permian and other shale and tight assets. We remain confident in exceeding our long-term production guidance.   Looking ahead to 2023, I'll call out a few items. Earnings estimates from first quarter refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo. Based on the current outlook, we expect higher natural gas costs for our California refineries. Full year guidance for all other segment losses is lower this year due to higher expected interest income and again excludes special items such as pension settlement costs.   The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We estimate annual affiliate dividends between $5 billion and $6 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. The difference between affiliate earnings and dividends is expected to be less than $2 billion. We do not expect a dividend from TCO in the first quarter.   We updated our earnings sensitivities. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG sales. Also, we expect to maintain share buybacks at the top end of our guidance range during the first quarter. Finally, as a reminder in Venezuela, we use cost affiliate accounting, which means we will only record earnings if we receive cash. We do not record production or reserves.   2022 was a record year for Chevron in many ways. We look forward to the future, confident in our strategy with a consistent objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day next month. Back to you, Roderick. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open the lines. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. We'd like to wish Roderick well in his new position, and we really appreciate all your time and help over the past 2 years. So thank you very much.   Our first question, maybe just heading towards the buyback authorization topic. This week, the Board authorized the buyback authorization up to $75 billion, no expiration date, which is pretty large versus the prior authorization that had a 4-year expiration date. We heard your comments on wanting to be a steady buyer of your shares across cycles and that you're positioned to return more cash to shareholders. Can you comment on the decision-making process for getting to that $75 billion and maybe the choice to leave the authorization open in timing versus the prior authorization did have an expiration date? Yes, Jeanine, let me start, and then I'll have Pierre add a little bit of color. We included a little information on this call looking back at our past programs. And as you saw on the Slide 15 and the last 19 years, we've bought shares back lower than the market volume weighted average over that period of time. We look at the decision going forward in the context of the cash-generating potential of the portfolio, the outlook for the market environment, the strength of the balance sheet. And we don't want to be authorizing a program every year. So we talk to the Board about a multiyear outlook.   So the fact that there's not an end date on it is only significant if you're trying to do some sort of math and annualize this. We think our track record speaks for ourselves and the steady, consistent way that we've done this. And so we increased the rate 3 times last year as we saw the situation evolve, and we're now at an all-time high with the rate of repurchases. So the last thing you said it, but I'll repeat it, in sized to maintain our program through the commodity cycle. We aren't pro-cyclical. We're not countercyclical. We're steady through the cycle, and that is the intention. Pierre, do you want to add anything? Yes, Jeanine. So the authorization from 2019 was going to be consumed in the second quarter. It was also open. So it did not have a defined time period. We just -- will have consumed it. So instead of having an authorization in the middle of the quarter, we'll complete this quarter's buybacks under the 2019 authorization, which again had an open time period, and then we'll start the new on April 1. So it is similar to the way it was done in the prior time. Thank you for that clarification. We appreciate that. Maybe our second question, it's that time of year again, reserve replacement ratio, your ratio for 2022 was 97%. And we believe that compared to 112% last year, and then I think it was around 99% on average for the 5 years before that. So our question for you is just -- how do you see this ratio trending over time? And I guess the over or under bogey is probably 100%. Yes. So it can move in any given year, Jeanine for a whole host of reasons, right? Prices, FID decisions, portfolio actions that we take to either sell or buy. And so the 1-year number is one that will move around. The longer cycle numbers, the one that you ought to pay attention to.   Remember also, as we have this large position in the Permian we continue to develop. We can only book 5 years forward. And so each year, we'll produce out of the unconventional assets, and we'll add another year's worth of reserves on the back end of that. And so if you were to look at the Permian unconstrained by that, you'd have a very different view. This year, we had some additions in the Permian and Israel and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as Pierre mentioned, the largest net reduction this year were Kazakhstan due to the contract terms and the effect of higher prices.   If you were to actually adjust that out, so we mentioned 100 million barrels where the price effect this year would be -- think of it as 107% ex the price effect. And so I do think over time, we intend to be in this business for quite a while and 100% is a number that you ought to expect to see that or greater over time. But in any given year or any short number of years, you might see something looks a little bit different. We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. First of all, Roderick, I wanted to [indiscernible] Jeanine, congrats on the new role, and thank you for all the help over the years. It's been great working with you.   So I wanted to focus in on upstream. And it's good to see the continued progress on TCO and exciting to be getting close to the finish line on the expansion project there. You noted that WPMP is on track for commissioning and start-up later this year. I just wanted to first confirm that the second part of that expansion,  FGP is still on track for '24. And then just stepping back, can you just walk us through your latest expectations to the impacts on both TCO production, CapEx and then also affiliate dividends as these projects come online. Trying to get a sense of the changes in '24 versus '23? And then also how you think about the run rate on both volumes and spending for that affiliate post FGP? Yes. Devin, I'll talk to the project and let Pierre talk a little bit to the financials. First of all, no change to cost or schedule guidance. WPMP is trending toward a beginning start-up by the end of this year. We've got a lot of work done. We've got a new power grid up and running, and this was a power grid built back in the Soviet days. The control room is up and running, where everything comes into one central control room. All the production on gas injection wells are done, the gas injection facility is now in early commissioning. In just the next few days, we'll tie in the fuel gas system to the first gas turbine generator, which is really an important milestone to test the first of the 3 GTGs, begin the process of powering up electrical generation capacity and commissioning boilers, steam and other utilities.   So that all happens sequentially here over the next period of time which leads to commissioning the pressure boost compressors in the third quarter and then converting the field from -- beginning the conversion from high to low pressure by the end of the year.   A couple of things that will bear on production. We've got 2 planned turnarounds of the old processing trains. They're called the KTL. There's 5 of them. We had 2 turnarounds this year that are planned in the third quarter. So those will be down for a period of time. And then as those come back up, production may not fully recover on those 2 as some of the wells won't resume flowing until we get to the low-pressure system.   So back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of that impact. And then as we move into '24, we've got more of these high pressure to low-pressure conversions in the field and we've got FGP start-up first half of '24. So you don't see the full effect of FGP roll through, you get partial effect in ramping in '24, and then the full effect will show in '25. Cash will kind of follow that pattern. So Pierre, maybe you can talk about the pattern on CapEx and dividends. Yes. For 2023, the TCO dividends are included in the guidance we provided, $5 billion, $6 billion, which is up from what our total dividends that we received last year. We did indicate that TCO has held a little excess cash during the course of last year just due to uncertainties that are going on right now.   The CapEx was included in our December release. So it's nearly half of the $3 billion of affiliate CapEx, so that's $1.5 billion. Again, you'd expect that to continue to roll off next year. And then if you go back to our Investor Day, we showed that at $60 Brent post start-up in a full year of FGP production that the free cash flow coming out of TCO on 100% basis would be $10 billion. And again, that's a $60 Brent. We'll provide further updates as we normally do on Investor Day. But the takeaway, as we've said for a long time, now we've been investing in this project for 6+ years through COVID, through the ups and downs, when it starts up, it will generate a lot of free cash flow. We'll see that in the form of dividends, and we'll see that in the form of paying back some of the loans that we co-lend into TCO. Devin, just to kind of put a final punctuation on that. In our Investor Day last year, we showed in 2026, so once we get fully on the other side of all this stuff I just described, a 5x expansion in free cash flow out of TCO versus 2021. So it's meaningful. Okay. Great. A helpful answer there. And then thinking about this year, 2023 in more detail. You talked about 0% to 3% total production growth for the year, led by sale in the Permian. And last year, you had another strong one for the Permian, volumes were up 16%. I was wondering if you could just talk through your expectations for that asset in 2023, whether or not you're adding rigs there, overall activity trends? And then more broadly within that 0% to 3% range, what are some of the drivers that can be viewed to the upper or lower end as we move through the year. Yes. Maybe I'll finish on -- I think the second question is about overall production, and the first was about Permian. So our outlook for 2023 at $80 is flat to up 3%, so that post between 3 million and 3.1 million barrels a day. There's a modest adjustment to that relative to our Investor Day guidance. A couple of things driving that, some project deferrals like Mad Dog 2, which we thought would start up in '22 and now looks like a '23 startup.   We've got some downtime, plans downtime that shifted from '22 to '23. And then our Permian growth would be a little bit lower in '23. A couple of things. One, in '22, we had the benefit of a lot of prior DUCs that had been sitting that came online and it boost early production in '22, a little bit more. And then we also are re-optimizing some of our development plans to factor in some of the things we continue to learn relative to interactions between wells and benches, how we space laterals and do single or multi-bench development. So our revised plan will have some deeper targets, a few more rig moves and a few more single bench developments all of which brings that pace down a little bit. So that's kind of at the highest level, what is behind the production numbers. We'll talk about that more when we see you guys in a month here. And maybe I'll stop there because I did cover the Permian as part of that. Katie, we can go to the next question. Katie, can you hear us? We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Congrats here on a good year. Mike, I guess the first question I have for you is around global gas. And maybe you can talk about how you're seeing the market. There's obviously been a tremendous amount of volatility and remind us again how you're positioned from a contracted versus spot position? And then I have a follow-up on gas as well in the Eastern Med. Okay. Well, high level, we certainly have seen a very unusual and volatile year in '22, which has settled out here as we've come into the winter, primarily as we've seen a bit milder winter in the northern hemisphere than is typical. And as in Europe, the successful build of inventories for this year and the reduction of industrial demand have both resulted in an outlook that is less dire for the European economies, then it may have looked like several months ago.   And so I think the market reflects all of that. You also have the fact that China has been -- the economy has been slow throughout the year, which is -- looks to be turning around. And so I think it's good that markets have calmed. I mean the high prices really were creating a lot of stresses out there that are not good. And I hope we see these prices stay in a more moderate range as we enter 2023.   Our posture is largely as we've described it before, we're primarily contracted on oil index pricing, biggest piece, obviously, out of Australia. We do have -- we ran really well in Australia last year, a record number of cargoes and so there were some spot cargoes in the mix out of Australia, out of West Africa, we've got a little more spot exposure in Angola and now with Equatorial Guinea as well. But think of us as primarily oil-linked. And we've got some sensitivities, I think that Pierre has put out there, and we've reiterated some of those in the guidance today that should help you model these things based on your assumptions on gas prices. And that's the follow-up. You have a large gas position in the Eastern Mediterranean following the noble acquisition with Leviathan and Tamar and some discoveries out there as well. So how do you think about prosecuting that asset? Where does it fall in terms of prioritization? And how big can it be? Yes. It's a high priority. We took FID at the end of last year on a project to expand Tamar from -- on a 100% basis, 1.1 to 1.6 Bcf per day. The first gas on that should come online in early 2025. We are working on development options to expand Leviathan. Those are still being worked and we should narrow the concepts on that later this year and reach some decisions in terms of how we intend to do that.   The Norgas discovery, it's just one well at this point, but it encountered a significant section of high-quality gas-bearing sandstone. So very attractive. We're talking to our partner there about appraisal and development concepts that will follow. So that region -- and of course, we've got a number of additional exploration blocks further to the west in the Mediterranean that we've not yet put any wells into but we've got seismic and we're developing our exploration plans and you'll hear more about that as we go forward. So it's a high priority. The region needs gas, both regionally in the Middle East, but also then obviously options to try to get that gas into Europe. And so the noble acquisition was really advantageous from that standpoint, and we're optimistic about the prospectivity of some of these additional exploration blocks. We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Roderick, I'd like to also pass on my thanks. You've transformed Chevron and those Investor Relations. Thank you for all your help.   Guys, I wonder if I could go back to the buyback. I just want to try and understand a little bit about the comment around really just how you think about the purpose of the buyback. Is this really about dividend management at this point? Because it seems to us that if you take your Brent sensitivity into account, the run rate at the high end of the range puts you about a $90 breakeven on your oil price. And I'm just wondering if this is about value or about managing confidence in future dividend growth. Well, let me try to be clear on this, Doug. We do not do buybacks to manage dividends. Dividend -- absolute dividend load is an outcome. It's not a reason that you would do buybacks. Our dividend growth expresses confidence in the ability to grow free cash flow at mid-cycle prices, and it is a long-term decision, a long, long, long-term decision. We haven't cut the dividend since the great depression. Pierre mentioned, we've increased the payout 36 years in a row now.   Buybacks are different. They signal confidence that we're going to generate excess free cash flow, where we've got excess balance sheet capacity, which we have significant capacity in the current commodity cycle. And as we satisfy our commitments on the dividend, our reinvestment plans in a disciplined manner to grow free cash flows and maintain that strong balance sheet, we've got the capacity then to buy shares back through the cycle. An outcome of buybacks is a lower absolute dividend, but it's not the driver. And so I don't want -- there should be no confusion about that. We've got confidence in our dividend increases, whether we're buying shares back or not. We wouldn't increase the dividend if we didn't have that confidence. And so the 2 are not linked in that manner. That's very clear. My follow-up is a bit unfair given your Analyst Day is a month away, but I'm going to give this a go anyway. But -- so if you made the point in your balance sheet is in terrific shape, obviously. You've got a lot of capacity there. But also, if I go back to that. let's say the $90 breakeven, all I'm doing is taking that $15 billion run rate, $400 million a year and adding it to the $50 breakeven -- $90. What does that say about your outlook for maybe stepping up growth capital?   That would seem to imply that the growth capital of the $17 billion CapEx number is probably what we should expect going forward. Is that the right way to think about it? Or should we wait until the end of the month or the end of February? Yes. I mean, we'll talk about it more in February. I'm not sure I followed all your math there, but we're growing. We had a 3% compound annual growth rate at $15 billion to $17 billion of CapEx in a market that's not growing that fast. We're growing well better than the overall demand for oil or for gas, which is growing faster than oil is. And so we are growing production, but what we're really focused on is growing returns and cash flow.   And if we can grow returns and cash flow, the equation works. And so I -- we'll be happy to talk about this more when we're together at the end of the month, but -- or at the end of next month. But we can grow cash flow, we can improve returns at the rate that we're spending at. And so I don't know why there would be a questions about our ability to do that and the production numbers and outcome of those decisions. It's not the goal. We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. So maybe just kind of a spin on Doug's question. So with the balance sheet at 3%, is there a point where you think of yourself is actually underlevered and I realize that's a good problem to have. But if you ever got to that point with the mechanism be to get leverage higher by increasing the buyback? Or how do you think about that generally is the 3% kind of where you want to be? This is Pierre. I'll take that. Our guidance is for the net debt ratio to be between 20% and 25% and mid-cycle conditions. And as you said, we're at 3%, so we're much stronger than that. And that's what happens in the short term. So Mike has talked about our financial priorities. They're simple. We've been consistent with them for a very long time. And 3 of the 4 are pegged. We just increased our dividend 6%. We have a 23 CapEx budget of $14 billion. We've given guidance that keeps that CapEx flat over the next several years. And we have the buybacks at the top end of the guidance range of $15 billion.   So swings in cash flow in the short term, will go to the balance sheet. And that's because commodity prices and margins, we just were talking about natural gas prices and refining margins and things are moving up and down. But over the long term, those cash flows will be returned to shareholders. And so we want to do it in a way that is steady across the cycle. As Mike said, we don't want to be pro-cyclical. And by the way, we haven't, right? Our track record shows that over the past nearly 2 decades that we've been able to buy actually below what the market average price has been.   So the intent is to, yes, we'll be a little strong balance sheet depending on commodity prices and margins and how strong our operations have been. But then over time, the cycle will correct and then we'll continue buying back shares. We've said we could have a higher buyback rate right now. We're sizing it at a level to maintain it for multiple years across the cycle. That means there'll be a time period where we'll be buying back shares off the balance sheet, and we'll lever back up closer to that 20% to 25% guidance. Thanks, John. Very clear. And just a follow-up on the TCO project. I was hoping you could give an update on the CPC terminal operationally and kind of where that stands? And then what type of discounts are you seeing at that terminal right now? I think you called out a few quarters ago or maybe 2 quarters ago that it was $6 or $7 per barrel. I imagine that's come in a bit. So where is that discount today? And how is that terminal operating. Yes. So last year, there was probably more news than there was impact on a variety of issues relative to the pipeline and the terminal. There was work going on in the kind of late third and into the fourth quarter on the 2 of the 3 single point moorings. All that work is done. All 3 SPMs are operational today. There are no constraints on loading. There are no constraints on throughput on the pipe.   Despite a lot of the things that people heard and worried about last year, the pipeline was very reliable. Our production was impacted less than 10,000 barrels a day over the course of the year. It was only a few weeks in March and April. And so everything there is running very smoothly now, and we don't see any constraints.   Discounts have come in a little bit on CPC. In the immediate aftermath of some of the sanctions and changes related to Ukraine. We saw a trading range that was like $4 to $10 below dated Brent. And before the conflict began, it was plus or minus $1. We're seeing kind of $1 to $3 discounts now. So maybe not quite at pre-invasion levels but not as deep as they were immediately afterwards. And given the overall flat price environment and the way it has strengthened the impact to [ CCO ] is relatively muted. We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Just looking at, let's call it, refined product demand. You talked about gas demand earlier. I'm just curious, as you look around the world, we've got positives moving away from COVID on a year-over-year comparison and then everybody's got high expectations for the China reopening. I was just curious, as you look across your operating base, what you're seeing there? Yes. Overall, Roger, gasoline demand, I'll start there. Still just a touch below pre-pandemic levels, fourth quarter of '22 maybe 2% or 3% below fourth quarter of '19. If you look at diesel, demand is pretty flat versus pre-pandemic. Jet recovering, but still below and so at the highest level, we're kind of still flattish to recovering from pre-Covid. I think that's why there is concern that as China's economy really does come through and return to a more normal level, that we could see increased demand start to pull on these markets again.   You've seen announcements out of China about their intention. We see international flights and air travel now being scheduled at much higher levels than we've seen before long. And if you see the kind of rebound spending and activity in that economy that we've seen in other economies around the world, that's one of the things that could [ boid ] the global economy and firm up demand for products.   So there's still some variables in the equation. We're not past the risk of recession and clearly, central banks are still tightening to slow things in certain parts of the world. So there's some puts and takes. But net-net, this continues to trend in a recovering direction with the 2 biggest questions probably related to the 2 biggest economies, China and the U.S. Always the big guys, right? A follow-up question to come back to the Permian, and I recognize the Investor Day coming. But Pierre, when we were at the sell-side dinner end of November, there was a lot of discussion over kind of the changing in the range and how that was really just a function of messaging more so than overall change in the way you're developing the Permian, kind of following from that to the comments about things a little different in the bench and the DUC comparisons year-over-year. You look at it as any different from the messaging at the end of November? Or is this -- is there something else here with. No, nothing different. We'll show that at our Investor Day. Again, we were in the middle of the range. You can see the fourth quarter number was 738. So that was strong. We had some learnings, as Mike said, in 2022, and we've adjusted our plans to go to deeper targets and more single bench developments and that results in a little longer drilling times and a few more rig moves and we'll update all that. And all that is obviously included in our production guidance. So we'll continue to learn and adapt in the Permian. It's a large royalty advantage position. It's an asset that delivers higher returns and lower carbon. It's a big source of free cash flow.   Our free cash flow growth over the next 5 years is really driven by Permian, Tengiz, Gulf of Mexico, a few other assets. And it's remarkable to have an asset that can grow at that rate and do it free cash flow positive the whole time and free cash flow growing the whole time. So it will ebb and flow a little bit as we learn more, but what you'll see at our Investor Day, something very consistent with what we're saying today and what we said in the past. And Roger, just to emphasize the point I made earlier to another one of the questions, we remain focused on returns and value, not on production. And so that is the -- that's what drives all of this. Thanks. We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe General. Thank you very much for taking my questions which are both related. So I will ask both at the same time. So firstly, thinking about balance sheet strength, of course, the other use it can be put to is M&A. You've been very disciplined with your M&A timings, both with Noble and REGI. How do you see the current market in these 2, let's say, [ POTS ] legacy oil and gas versus low carbon. And then secondly, has the IRA Act perhaps changed your appetite for faster expansion in low carbon businesses, please? Thank you, Irene. So we do have the capacity to do M&A. We don't need to do M&A. And so we'll only do deals that are value-creating deals. You interestingly contrast the traditional oil and gas market with the new energies market. What I would observe is given commodity price strength in oil and gas, we've seen companies that previously might have been languishing from a value standpoint, strengthen. And I think there's some optimism in the eyes of other companies about the future. And so the bid asks read on oil and gas companies is maybe a little wider right now given the strength versus when we did our deal a couple of years ago.  In lower carbon, with interest rates rising and specs kind of receding and the like. A little bit of the kind of froth may have come out of that market, but there are still some optimism in valuations there as well. And so we'll be very thoughtful and careful as we evaluate those. And there are a lot of companies out there that have got business models in this space. So we watch them all. We will be back to talk to you if we have anything that's interesting.  Let me touch on IRA and then ask Pierre to add a little more color. The IRA will probably accelerate some activity in the U.S. There's no doubt. Hopefully, what that does is it allows technologies to be derisked. The cost of technologies to be reduced and the attractiveness of these investments to improve. A bill like that with all kind of a grab bag of different policy incentives doesn't necessarily change our long-term view on how we want to build businesses. It does perhaps change the trajectory at which some of those businesses become more economically viable. And if that's the case, that could feed through into our similar investment decision. But it's kind of a second order effect rather than a first order effect. And just to add some of the other important effects, permitting really critical for traditional energy, super critical for new energy, new technology developments. You've seen us make some investments on technology to reduce the cost of capture of CO2 and then scale, getting cost down. So it's helpful, but it's just one element, as Mike said. We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Maybe if I could ask a couple on the downstream side. First, there's been a lot of noise earlier this year about refinery maintenance activity looking to be well above average in the U.S., particularly in the first half of the year, especially amongst independent refiners. Your first quarter guidance seems to suggest turnaround activity in 1Q that's reasonably light or at least not terribly heavy. Any thoughts on whether 2020 -- year 2023 outlook as a whole for Chevron looks normal or heavy in terms of refining and maintenance and then maybe more broadly, how you see general tightness in global refining markets this year over the course of 2023. Yes. I would say it's a pretty typical year for turnaround activity. We've got the FCC at El Segundo in the first quarter of this year, which Pierre mentioned in his comments. But there's nothing unusual in our turnaround plan for this year. What you do see across the U.S. and I think in some of the other markets are 2 things that are really kind of still echoes of COVID. One is you're just seeing capacity go out of the system. And two, you see maintenance that was deferred during COVID is -- had to be rescheduled and replanned. And so there's probably still a bit of a bow wave of pushing through the system in some places of activity that needs to get done for safety and reliability and regulatory reasons. And so that could be driving some of the speculation. I can't really comment on other companies' plans. I'll let you talk to them about that. And then maybe on the other side of your downstream business on the chemical side, it's clearly been weeks for the last little while. Looking forward from here, is the combination of lower natural gas prices and the reopening of China having any impact on how you see margins moving throughout 2023? Or do you anticipate that oversupply keep things weaker throughout the year? These tend to be long period cycles for the most part, Ryan. And so at the margin, I think that's economic growth and development in China is a positive. But you don't slide into the lower part of the cycle quickly or easily, and you generally don't come out of it quickly or easily. So these things track over a longer period of time. And so I do think we're -- it feels like we're kind of bumping along near the bottom here, but I don't know that there's a steep climb out as opposed to a gradual climb over time. We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. I wanted to first follow up on the affiliate distribution guidance because it is taking a step higher year-over-year, and it sounds like that was due to TCO having excess cash. Is that kind of $5 billion to $6 billion, something you can maintain assuming oil price stays stable until the project actually starts up until TCO, FGP starts up or would you expect that to fall off after this year?  And then my second question is on a different topic, Venezuela. I believe you have now boots on the ground there again. Can you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of the health of the infrastructure there, the ability to ramp production and the desire from Chevron's standpoint to participate in that? On affiliate dividends, there are 2 main factors, why the guidance this year is higher than last year. You hit one of them on TCO, not held excess cash last year.  The second big one is Angola LNG. You recall, a lot of their cash distributions were actually return to capital. It's an accounting concept tied to whether you have book equity or positive book equity or not now, they're in that space. So we expect most, if not all, of the cash coming from Angola LNG in '23 to be characterized as dividends. It was cash either way. It's just one shows up in cash from ops, the other one shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but that's the second driver.  And in terms of the direction, I mean, this guidance is kind of notionally at the current -- futures curve around $80. So it depends on commodity prices and margins. There are some downstream affiliates in there, and there are some chemicals, obviously, in there. But we talked about TCO. I mean, TCO's heading up, right? As CapEx comes down and production comes up, we expect more dividends out of TCO going forward. And then again, we have the loan that we also expect TCO to pay back during the next several years. Yes, Jason, on Venezuela, we always did have boots on the ground. We just were very limited in where those boots could go and what they could do. The shift in the sanctions policy has opened up a little more room. It's allowed us to work with PDVSA to put some of our people into different roles in these mixed companies there. So we do have a little more ability to have influence and involvement in some of the decision making.  Your question about the state of the infrastructure, there's been a lack of investments there for a number of years in the infrastructure reflects that, and it will take time for things to turn around. We have seen some positive production response already in the entities that we're involved in. They're producing about 90,000 barrels a day now, which is up about 40,000 barrels a day since we saw the change in these license terms. So that's been a good short-term effect. I'm not going to say you can extrapolate that, but it's where we are today. We are continuing to work on the ground to expand production, but it's too early to guide to anything. We're also lifting oil and bringing it to the U.S. We've got a couple of cargoes coming into our Pascagoula refinery. We're going to be delivering cargoes to other customers on the Gulf Coast. And then the revenues go into a series of structured channels to pay expenses and other obligations.  On the accounting standpoint, we're using cost affiliate accounting. So we'll record earnings only if we receive cash. And at this point, I would say the cash flows are expected to be modest. So this is a step-wise change in the environment there. We're going to go into it thoughtfully. It's a 6-month license, and it's a dynamic environment. So we'll continue to advise you as we learn more and as things evolve. We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. I'll ask about the Rockies. The Rockies is interesting. It's a place where you could maybe add a little bit of activity to face your aggregate Lower 48 activity levels, but without some of the inflationary pressures and just infrastructure tightness in the Permian and inventory depth there is good. Is the Rockies a place where there may be a little bit of extra focus. And I ask that in the context of sort of the broader theme around your overall resource depth and production and all these topics that are sort of flowing into the broader conversation today. Yes, absolutely, Sam. We got over 320,000 net acres there. Last year, we started out with one rig and one frac crew. We ended the year with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews working and the plan for this year is activity in that level. So it's been a positive movement in terms of activity and production expectations there.  It's a really nice resource. It's a low carbon resource. It's a -- we got a lot of this is powered off the grid. There's been some permitting questions about this in the past. There's been large areas done under development plans, and we've got permits well out into the future and continue to work that closely with the authorities there. So it's one we can talk about a little bit more at Investor Day. It's a really positive part of addition to our portfolio out of Noble and the Eastern Med gets a lot of attention, but we're very excited about the DJ. Okay. And yes, just a follow-up. I mean, because obviously, between -- I think you can surmise the reserve numbers getting some attention to the overall pace of activity and production trends over the long term are getting attention. But we'll get to this at the Analyst Day, I'm sure. But is there a way right now where you can kind of add it all up and size the Gulf of Mexico, other shale and tight, Eastern Med gas and just kind of frame that aggregate resource number against maybe what you see in the portfolio today as tail resource and just speak to a final answer around your organic portfolio and how it extends. Yes. I might have Roderick work with you. So we're clear on the question when we get to the Investor Day on how to compare and size things relative to the portfolio. But we said today in our press release that we're very confident we're going to exceed our 3% compound annual growth rate over the next 5 years. You can't do that unless you get depth in the portfolio, which we have. And you got quality projects they're moving along on a good pace. And so I'll assure you that, that is the case. We will talk about this more at Investor Day, and you'll have a chance to kind of go deeper into it with our folks. We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Roderick, congratulations, all the best. Mike, I was a bit surprised by the major buyback announcement. Obviously, the $75 billion is very splashy. But within that, it seems that your guidance has remained that you'll be in the $5 billion to $15 billion a year range based on the Q1 guidance. Is there -- are you expecting to step that up? Or is this a 5-year authorization? And were you conscious that it would probably cause a lot of political backlash. Yes. So Pierre answered the question earlier, it's not a 5-year authorization. It's an open-ended authorization. It is -- it's our intent to maintain it across the cycle. I'll just say that again. It's actually aligned with our upside and our downside cases from the '22 Investor Day and consistent with our track record of being in the market steadily buying $2 below the market over nearly the past 2 decades. And we could increase our guidance range, Paul. We need to be confident we could maintain that higher rate for multiple years across the cycle. And I think that you should read it as a signal of confidence and we'll continue to talk more.  We raised our buyback rate 3x last year. So we're not averse to doing that. And I would just say stay tuned. In terms of the reaction to it, I think it's perhaps been a touch overblown given that it's an open-ended program, and we could have size the smaller one and just been prepared to do another one sooner. Pierre said we're closing one out. We just looked at something that would last over a number of years, and we were trying to be splashy when we're trying to create any reaction out there. We're just trying to indicate the confidence we have in our cash generation. Understood. And offset to that, Mike, you're spending more on exploration. Could you just talk about the highlights that you see coming up in 2023. Obviously, we're aware of East Med, but there's other stuff out there and the spending has stepped up quite a lot, hasn't it? Yes. I don't know if I describe the spending as being up quite a lot. We've got a nice portfolio that we like. And I'll just touch on -- you mentioned Eastern Med. We still have a lot of blocks in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We've got block in Suriname that we're still working on and that are on trend with some of the things in that region. We've picked up acreage in Namibia that's on trend with explorations in that part of the world as well. And so we got stuff in Brazil, we had stuff in Mexico that we acquired a few years prior to that. So we've got a nice portfolio of opportunities that we continue to work on, and we don't go out and drill the wells until we're ready to drill them. But it's spread across a number of basins where there's good working oil and gas systems. And the Norgas discovery is a recent example of what happens when you focus in those areas, and I'm optimistic that we're going to see more of that in the future. Our last question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. So the first one is on the share count. Just going back to early 2022, there was a period where you're stepping up the buyback program, but the dilution from the employee options was offsetting that a little. So I'm just trying to understand, I know you took a charge today in the corporate line. Do you expect 2023 dilution to be a similar level to 2022? Or should it be lower? Just any sense on that would be helpful. We expect fewer employee and retiree exercises of stock options. That was extraordinary unusual in the first quarter. And it's a zero-sum game. In other words, if employees and retirees do it early, there's fewer to do going forward. But that will be up to them and the stock price performance. And the share buybacks, I mean, you just divide it depends on what our stock price is. We give guidance quarterly, and I think you can do the math. It is confusing the difference between average annual share count and where we end, right? So we are clearly taking our share count down. But when you look at average annuals, that's exactly what it implies. It's an annual each day, but the trend is going down. Our buybacks exceed the issuances and we expect that to continue. That's very clear. And then second question is just thinking about asset sales. I was looking at your guidance, 2023 plans are fairly muted. And I appreciate that you're basically close to 0 debt, so you don't actually need to do anything but in a high commodity price environment, maybe countercyclically, you might want to accelerate something. So is this a function of just the limited cleanup needed in the portfolio or a view on bid-ask spread or anything else? Just to get your view on the asset sale market at the moment. Yes. So Biraj, we are a little lower than what our typical level of guidance has been, our level of activity. Over the last decade, we've generated about $35 billion in asset sales. So that's, say, [ $3.5 million ]. There was some portfolio cleanup underway there that was needed to be done, and we get good value as we sold those. You're always looking at your tail. There's always -- when you sell things off, there's a new part of your portfolio and say, okay, this sits at the margin. And so you're always challenging that. If we were to find interested buyers and some of the things that might fit better for others than they do for us, we could transact on that. This is -- the guidance that we've got right now and the things that are underway and in process is what we've put out there, and we'll update you if there's any changes to that. And to only add, Biraj, we don't do asset sales to raise cash or to manage the balance sheet. We do it based on what Mike just said, high grading of the portfolio where we can get the best returns for capital projects that can compete for capital, some of the impairments that we took in the fourth quarter are a result and outcome of projects that are good projects. They're just not good enough to clear the bar. So it does ebb and flow a little bit as Mike has said, but I just want to be clear, we do it as part of our capital discipline and having -- driving higher returns and lower carbon. It's an outcome of that. It ebbs and flows. It's a little low this year. We set it to go back higher in future years. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy. Katie, back to you. Thank you. This concludes Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect."

         "Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Fourth Quarter 2022 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden.  As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures.  Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.  And now I'll turn it over to Chris. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year, we expected 2022 to be a year of recovery from the pandemic, particularly in Europe. Little did we know that it would be another challenging year, and nobody could have predicted the extent to which the war in Europe would disrupt businesses around the world and the macroeconomic impact that would follow.  Despite continued volatility in nearly every corner of the globe, McDonald's delivered exceptional growth throughout 2022. We achieved full year comp sales growth of 10.9%, delivered strong comp -- guest count performance with 5% growth globally and saw our momentum strengthen as the year progressed with double-digit comp sales growth across all segments in Q4. These results are a testament to the resilience of the McDonald's system and demonstrate that our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which we unveiled in the early days of the pandemic, is working. This strategy is anchored by 3 growth pillars also known as our M, C and Ds: maximize our marketing, commit to the core menu and double down on the 3Ds. Our 2022 performance demonstrated the continued potential of each growth pillar.  You've heard me say, McDonald's is one of the world's greatest brands. In the last year, we've unlocked even more ways to elevate our marketing through creative excellence. Our scalable insights are helping us tap into our fans' love for McDonald's and create culturally relevant campaigns that resonate across markets and drive growth. That momentum continued into Q4. In October, our collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market in the U.S. brought together our adult fans' love and nostalgia for the Happy Meal with one of the most on-trend brand and culture. Customer excitement was palpable, and it's fair to say the program exceeded expectations. This program drove the highest weekly digital transactions ever seen in the U.S.  To celebrate the FIFA World Cup, we launched our largest global marketing campaign ever with more than 75 markets participating worldwide. Want to go to McDonald's brought to life yet another fan truth. Whatever the culture or language and whatever the outcome of the game, we can all unite under the Golden Arches. Our aim was to support fans that were watching the FIFA World Cup at home through relevant and meaningful McDelivery promotions regardless of the time zone that their team was playing in. During this campaign, we saw double-digit increases in delivery sales across our top 10 markets.  And just a couple of weeks ago, the U.K. launched their Raise Your Arches campaign, which has generated significant excitement with our customers. Even though the campaign never shows our food, never shows our restaurant and never mentions our brand name, it's nonetheless instantly recognizable as only McDonald's. Imagine that, a brand so powerful it requires no introduction. The campaign has been quickly picked up by over 30 other markets, demonstrating our system's ability to quickly scale compelling ideas across the globe.  Throughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items they love. The strength of our brand goes beyond the Golden Arches themselves and includes our iconic products such as our world-famous french fries, the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets and the McFlurry. Each of these products are billion-dollar brands. And in total, McDonald's possesses 10 of these billion-brand equities.  In an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. Throughout the year, we continue to step up our game on the favorites that build our heritage. We're delivering hotter, juicier, more delicious burgers and building on the success of emerging equities like the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich. As a result, we are gaining market share in both chicken and beef.  When customers want to enjoy our classic favorites, they are increasingly looking for even more personalized and convenient ways to get their meals. Through our focus on digital, we are transforming from a brand that serve billions and billions all the same way to one that serves each of our billions of customers uniquely as individuals with customized products, offers and experiences. By doing this, we strengthen our customers' love and loyalty for McDonald's.  These investments are paying off. In the fourth quarter, digital represented over 35% of system-wide sales in our top 6 markets. In 2022, the McDonald's app was downloaded over 40 million times in the U.S., greater than the total downloads of the second, third and fourth brands combined.  Through our loyalty program, which we've expanded to over 50 markets and counting, customers are feeling more connected to McDonald's, which in turn increases visits and frequency. As we closed the year, we had almost 50 million active loyalty users in our top 6 markets.  The success of Accelerating the Arches has put McDonald's in an advantaged position. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown system-wide sales nearly $20 billion despite closing over 800 restaurants in Russia. Our brand is clearly in the strongest position it's been in years, attributable in part to our best-in-class marketing engine. And service times and customer satisfaction are both improving, a testament to the dedication of our restaurant teams.  Our success is fueling even greater ambitions. While we feel good about our strategy and the growth potential in each of our MCD pillars, we've been asking ourselves 2 questions: is there anything we should add to Accelerating the Arches? And is there anything that could get in the way of the success of Accelerating the Arches?  The answers to these 2 questions led us to evolve our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which we announced a few weeks ago. We'll continue to double down on our MCDs while adding a fourth D, restaurant development, to our 3Ds growth pillar. Our strong comp and brand performance has given us the right to build new units at a faster rate than we have historically. We also announced accelerating the organization, an effort to modernize the way we work so that we're faster, more innovative and more efficient. Work is now underway to further build out these initiatives and quantify their contribution to our long-term financial algorithm. We'll share more details with all of you at an investor update in Chicago sometime in late 2023.  To expand further on how Accelerating the Arches drove success in 2022, I'll now turn it over to Ian. Thanks, Chris. By putting our customers at the center of Accelerating the Arches, we're driving top line momentum and broad-based global strength for our brand. Global comparable sales were up double digits for the fourth quarter, and we continue to gain share across most of our major markets. Our performance is a direct result of executing against our strategy, making it clear that we're operating from a position of strength and proving once again that our business remains resilient despite the dynamic macro environment.  In our International Operated Markets, we leveraged our digital channels and highlighted our core menu, delivering comp sales growth of nearly 13% for the quarter. As our big 5 International Operated Markets continued to recover from COVID throughout the year, we consistently created delicious feel-good moments for our customers, achieving strong performance across each of these markets.  The U.K. continued their focus on chicken with an early fourth quarter launch of the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich. This emerging global equity builds on iconic core favorites like Chicken McNuggets and drove a meaningful lift to the chicken category. The U.K. market also leaned into the power of our brand with the popular Reindeer Ready holiday campaign returning for the sixth consecutive year. The fourth quarter also brought the return of McDonald's Monopoly to the Canadian market, but this time utilizing our app to elevate the experience. We leveraged learnings from recent U.K. and Australia activations where we combined the nostalgic peel-off game pieces with the option to digitally scan and track progress on our app, which helped accelerate top line momentum and sales through our digital channels.  Fueling digital growth was also central to Germany's strong performance with the market's first MyMcDonald's-branded affordability campaign. This promotion featured daily offers alongside mobile order messaging to drive full digital platform engagement. It was followed by the launch of digital Monopoly in the market, which helped grow digital to over 60% of total sales. It's examples like this that once again highlight the power of the McDonald's system, allowing us to tap into proven successes in one market and then scale those ideas.  In Australia, we continued to leverage the strength of our McCafé brand with an iced coffee promotion in the summer months. This campaign built upon our coffee leadership in the market as we continued to drive share gains. And we maintained our market leadership in France with always-on family messaging and a fully integrated chicken campaign, highlighting our iconic Chicken McNuggets paired with unique and trendy sauces.  Moving to the U.S. Comp sales were up over 10% for the quarter, a testament to our work together with franchisees over the last several years, which has created a strong foundation. The collective decisions to put brand at the center of our marketing, along with simplifying our menus, strengthening our digital business and recommitting to our core, have resonated with consumers and are continuing to drive growth. Strategic calendar planning from marketing to restaurant execution has enabled our teams to stay laser-focused on what truly matters most for our customers.  Higher average check supported by strategic price increases as well as positive guest counts contributed to our performance this quarter. Memorable marketing campaigns, including our collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market, Boo Buckets and McRib brought nostalgia to our customers, fueling top line momentum with limited added complexity in our restaurants.  Turning to our International Developmental Licensed Markets. Comp sales were up over 16% for the quarter with strong sales growth across all geographies in the segment. Japan achieved an impressive 29th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales with continued strength at the dinner daypart. A focus on driving digital affordability helped increase the frequency of our most loyal digital customers.  Recovery in China, however, remained challenging as COVID-related government restrictions were still in place for a majority of the fourth quarter, resulting in some temporary closures and limited operations. While comp sales in China were negative, we focused on showcasing our strength in beef with the Big Mac best burger launch and continued to gain traffic share in a shrinking QSR market. And despite the ongoing operating challenges, we opened over 700 new restaurants last year, which is an all-time high.  Turning to our P&L. Company-operated margins were just over 15% for the quarter, reflecting the continued pressure from elevated commodities, wages as well as higher energy costs. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.16 per share with earnings per share of $2.59 for the quarter.  For the full year, adjusted operating margin was nearly 45%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments. Despite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed, top line results generated restaurant margin dollars of over $13 billion for the year, an increase of nearly $1.5 billion in constant currency. Franchise restaurants, which now represent 95% of our global portfolio, contributed nearly 90% of our total restaurant margins, reflecting the stability of our business model.  Lastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was approximately $1.9 billion, which included remaining reinvestment to substantially complete our Experience of the Future efforts in the U.S. market. Over the last few years, we've invested billions of dollars in modernizing our estate, and it's clear in our results that these investments are paying off. After reinvesting in the business, our free cash flow conversion was nearly 90% for the year.  And with that, let me pass it back over to Chris. Thanks, Ian. As we look ahead to 2023, macroeconomic uncertainties will persist, and we expect to continue to face headwinds. Our base case for a mild to moderate recession in the U.S., and one that will be a little deeper and longer in Europe, is unchanged from what we shared on our Q3 earnings call. We also expect inflationary costs to continue to pressure our margins, which Ian will discuss in greater detail.  In this environment, we must maintain our disciplined approach to pricing. We need to balance passing through our pricing on our menus while maintaining our strong position on value with our customers. Our positive guest count performance in 2022 demonstrates our success so far in balancing these competing demands, and we need to remain judicious with pricing actions.  Ongoing communication with our franchisees regarding the magnitude and pace of pricing will remain essential. Our franchisees are focused on the long term. And time and again, that approach has been rewarded. As long as we continue to do the right things for the customer, we can always work through short-term challenges.  McDonald's understands that customers' perception on value is made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience we provide. Our modernization efforts have had a significant impact on improving our customers' experience, and this is also improving how our customers think of our brand. Now that we are nearly fully modernized, our attention has turned to being laser-focused on our operations and running great restaurants.  In 2022, we have reengaged most of our system on maintaining operational excellence in our restaurants through our Performance and Customer Excellence program, also known as PACE. This restaurant assessment and consulting tool, which is currently deployed in 30 markets, was suspended during COVID. Along with providing new tools, this represents a new way of working for our field teams that helps markets target organizational and restaurant support for key growth drivers. This renewed focus will help protect McDonald's brand standards for an outstanding customer experience every single day.  Restarting PACE in 2022 led to strong operational improvements in several key markets as a result of a more dedicated consulting and coaching time to support lower-performing restaurants. For example, the U.K. saw improved customer satisfaction, speed of service and overall experience for these restaurants. In Spain, restaurants that had the lowest customer satisfaction scores in the drive-thru improved to be at the same level as top-performing restaurants by the end of 2022. Additionally, as a result of this program, France saw increases of 30% in customer satisfaction scores at locations with the lowest scores.  PACE clearly drives operational improvements, which provides a better customer experience that in turn drives business performance. This month, the U.S. also restarted PACE, and we expect to see similar operational benefits in our largest market in 2023.  I'll now turn it back to Ian to talk in more detail about our 2023 outlook. As Chris just discussed and as I talked about last quarter, we continue to operate in an extremely dynamic environment. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate macro-related pressures will continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business. With significant inflationary headwinds across commodities, labor and utilities, our company-operated margin percent will be hampered in the near term, and we expect full year 2023 company-operated margin percent will be slightly lower than our quarter 4 results.  This elevated cost environment is also impacting restaurant cash flow for our franchisees, particularly in our European markets. As we've previously mentioned, our financial strength and scale gives us the ability to provide temporary and targeted support, ultimately keeping our entire system aligned on proactively investing to drive long-term growth. We estimate that these efforts will have an impact of between $100 million to $150 million in 2023.  Turning to G&A. The digital and technology investments that we've made over the past few years have been strong contributors to our top line growth. Moving forward, focusing on our evolution of Accelerating the Arches and, in particular, accelerating the organization will enable us to work more efficiently and effectively, harnessing our scale and reallocating resources to drive growth in the future. In 2023, we expect G&A to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of system-wide sales. Despite the cost pressures throughout the P&L in 2023, we anticipate an operating margin of about 45% driven primarily by strong top line growth and franchise margin performance. We're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 10% and 12% compared to 2022, primarily due to higher average rates on our debt balances. And we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%. We anticipate currency translation will negatively impact earnings per share between $0.07 and $0.09 in the first quarter. As of now, we expect currency translation to be a slight tailwind for the full year. But as you have seen, currency rates have been fluctuating quite a bit recently. So we'll continue to keep you posted on the anticipated impact to our results.  Transitioning to capital expenditures. We plan to spend between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion this year, about half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings. Globally, we plan to open about 1,900 restaurants with more than 400 of these openings in our U.S. and IOM segments, where we continue to see strong returns. The remaining 1,500-or-so new restaurants, including about 900 in China, will be across our IDL markets. As a reminder, our strategic partners provide the capital for these restaurant openings. Overall, we anticipate almost 4% unit growth from the about 1,500 net restaurant additions in 2023. We expect this will contribute, along with restaurants opened in 2022, nearly 1.5% to system-wide sales growth.  As Chris mentioned, work is underway on our fourth D, restaurant development, within Accelerating the Arches. We'll have more details to share later this year, but we're excited about the opportunity to accelerate the pace of our new unit openings moving forward.  And finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2023, enabling us once again to convert more than 90% of our net income to free cash flow. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to invest in new units and opportunities to grow the business, along with reinvesting in existing restaurants; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to repurchase shares.  It's times like these that highlight the strength and scale of our McDonald's system. Although 2023 will bring short-term pressures, I'm confident that the resilience of our business and our strategy will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris to close. The McDonald's global system is executing at a high level, and I'm optimistic that our Accelerating the Arches strategy offers us a long runway of growth despite the headwinds that we've discussed on this call. The McDonald's brand is in great shape, and yet there's so much more we can do.  In my travels throughout our global system, I sometimes like to ask our people, what exactly does McDonald's Corporation sell? As you might imagine, this usually prompts a lot of puzzled looks, and a brave soul or 2 will raise their hand and say, \"Well, we sell great-tasting food or we sell burgers and fries.\" Of course, that's technically true. But as a largely franchised business, ultimately, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand so that others can sell burgers and fries. And while some may see it as a trivial distinction, I see it as fundamental. As goes the McDonald's brand, so goes the health and economic value of our company and system.  Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is designed to build our brand to make McDonald's more relevant to more people more often. Our MCD growth pillars are driving system-wide sales, and the recently announced Accelerating the Organization initiative will help us unlock further growth by enabling our system to be even faster, more innovative and more efficient. Through Accelerating the Organization, we'll sharpen our priorities and increase our investments against our biggest opportunities.  I want to congratulate the McDonald's system on a terrific 2022 and thank all 3 legs of the stool, our franchisees, our suppliers and our company employees, for their dedication and passion for our business. A global pandemic, record-breaking inflation, a war in Europe, the McDonald's system continues to execute and deliver no matter the challenge, and I'm excited to continue our success into 2023.  With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Palmer with Evercore. A big-picture question tied into some of the stuff you were talking about in the U.S. It's been fascinating to see how McDonald's traffic in the U.S. has largely declined, most years at least, even as you've added about $1 million in sales per unit. And your customer satisfaction scores and the external stuff that we see, it's been stubbornly and surprisingly low. It's almost like the consumer is being more honest with his or her spending rather than these surveys. So I'm wondering, in your work, where do you see the customer satisfaction opportunity in the U.S., whether that's in convenience and speed or food or other? And do you think the U.S. will have a different same-store traffic outcome over the next year or decade based on some of the stuff that you're doing? David, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Well, I think starting with, we've talked about it on a number of calls over the last several years that guest count is a very imprecise measure, and it's imprecise because of what we've seen with delivery, but also what we've seen with digital, where we're now getting multiple orders. And so while it's important for us to always be attentive to guest count, I think also recognize that the complexion of how customers are experiencing the restaurant has changed. So from that vantage point, we look at things from a relative perspective. And we feel very good about our relative performance on that as evidenced by our strong traffic growth that we had in the U.S. this year.  I think your larger question about the health of the brand, there are lots of different surveys. Ultimately for us, we have our own internal surveys, and customer satisfaction with McDonald's is strong. I think our brand clearly is resonating. As you've seen in our marketing communication, the fact that we have a modernized restaurant estate, I think, has been huge for us in terms of improving customer perception of the brand. And so I feel very good about that.  But for us, going forward, the opportunity for us to continue to make our brands more and more beloved is going to be on this digital opportunity. And as I mentioned in the opening comments there, digital gives us such an unlock to get more tailored in the experience, the offer and products that we're delivering to our customers. So I think for us, if we can get there on digital, that's going to be a big opportunity.  And we've made a lot of progress. As you heard in the opening comments, about 35%, I think it's 36% in Q4, were digital transactions. And by the way, half of those digital transactions are known digital transactions, where we know the customer. Imagine if that number -- I'll just use as one outlier, close to 90% of our transactions in China are digital transactions. And imagine if most of those are known transactions, you could start to imagine what that can mean for the brand in the long term. So I'm optimistic about where we're at. Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird. I had a question about the investments you're making in the franchisee system. I think, Ian, you mentioned it was $100 million to $150 million for this year. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on why that was necessary given the strength you're seeing in the top line or the franchisees presumably are seeing in the top line and also some signs that maybe the cost environment has not been as bad as feared. And then maybe as part of that question, if you could just comment on where franchisee-level cash flows are today versus maybe where they were a year ago, that would be helpful. Great. David, thanks for the question. Well, I think as you've heard us and particularly me speak to, I think particularly in Europe, we're seeing some quite strong headwinds due to the levels of inflation on things like commodity costs, energy prices and, of course, labor. And I think the pace and scale of inflation mean that those headwinds are creating relatively significant levels of short-term impact to our margins and then, of course, to our franchisee cash flows.  And I think one of the competitive advantages that we have as a global franchisor with our size, our scale and our brand strength is that we're able to provide that temporary and targeted support for our franchisees, which we always, of course, direct to where it's most needed. I mean, I would use the U.K. as a bit of an example in Europe. I mean, I think, obviously, we've seen significant levels of food inflation, significant levels of energy inflation. Even though energy maybe hasn't gotten to the peak of where some were predicting because Europe's had a warm or milder winter so far, I mean, it's still significantly above where it was 12 to 18 months ago. And I think, again, just the pace and scale of that impact is creating quite a bit of pressure on margins and cash flow, as I said.  And our size and scale, as I said, just allows us -- puts us in a position to provide that support, direct it to where it's most needed. I think, honestly, that's nothing new for McDonald's. I mean, it occurs from time to time around the world when conditions warrant. It's just a little bit more significant now just due to the broader nature and scale of some of those short-term impacts that we're seeing. And like if you remember, during COVID, we did provide support to our system. It was critically important because it allowed all of our system to stay focused on our plans and was really fundamental to the accelerated momentum that we saw through and then coming out of the pandemic.  This is a very similar situation. I mean, our system is highly aligned. It's confident, and it's focused on our strategic plans and is continuing to proactively invest against the opportunity areas that we have. So I think it's this that's really going to help us stay focused on the category-leading momentum we have and make sure that we -- as we get out of these headwinds, we're in the strongest possible position. Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Maybe if I can ask one about unit growth, if I can. I'm not sure you already finished '22 on a gross basis, but I'm guessing based on the year-end CapEx number that it was maybe slightly below your expectations. And then this year, you're expecting development to be a bigger focus and an uptick in unit openings to about 1,900. So maybe if you can comment on where you're starting to see maybe some improvement in the construction and permit timing and also what you're seeing in terms of build-out costs, perhaps directionally new unit economics given those higher costs and presumably the lower margins that you're signaling with your guidance. Eric, yes, thanks for that. I think for sure, in '22, we had some impact just from that -- coming out of COVID, some of the impacts on just getting permits approved. I mean, as you've heard us talk about in our outlook for '23, we think we're going to open on a gross basis about 1,900 locations, about 1,500 on a net basis. If you look specifically at the U.S. and IOM segments, we're planning about 400 openings there, and that's up about 25% from where we landed on in 2022. So I think that's a sign of the confidence we have and the opportunity that we've got in those segments to begin to start accelerating openings as we've talked about adding that fourth D, development.  For sure, I think there's certainly some inflation on the construction and development costs like we're seeing across almost every sector today. But we also know we've got opportunity, I think, to be more efficient and effective in our investments that we're making in some of the restaurant formats and how we can get more efficient and effective as we bring those formats up. And so feel really good about the returns that we're continuing to generate, particularly in the U.S. and our IOM segments, and feel confident in the opportunity we've got to add more units as we go forward. Yes. I would just add a couple of things. I mean, think about the U.S. for a moment. We haven't added new units in the U.S. in 8 years. I mean, 2014 was the last year that we actually grew restaurants in the U.S. So we've had 8 years where we have been focused largely on a remodel program. And in that same period of time, I think everybody would agree, our U.S. business is in a significantly better shape today than it was back then. And so you look at our 3-year stack, our 3-year stack in the U.S. is 25%. Our global 3-year stack is also around 25%. We've grown the business to a great degree. And what we haven't done is we haven't kept up with the new unit pace, particularly in our owned markets, U.S. and IOM. And so we're spending the time right now to get a very granular look at where we would build, at what pace and what types of restaurants. And that's the -- what we plan on sharing with you at the end of 2023. Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. Great. Just a question on the U.S. and Europe, clearly strong double-digit comp performance. I'm just wondering as you kind of look beneath the top line, any sign of slowing macro impact in the consumer or perhaps any concern of consumer pushback on the outsized menu pricing? Or maybe just looking more broadly, any color on McDonald's versus the industry in terms of market share in key markets since we know everyone is being more aggressive on price? Any kind of color you could provide would be great. I think overall, we're still seeing the consumer is resilient, and it plays to our strengths as a system in terms of being well positioned on value. We lead in every market around the world on affordability and value for money. And so that puts McDonald's in a strong position.  We've talked about on prior calls, there is a little bit of a decrease in units per transaction that we're seeing. We're seeing a little bit of trade-down. But I got to say, these are probably on the margin that we're seeing this. Overall, the consumer, whether it's in Europe or the U.S., is actually holding up better than what we would have probably expected or maybe what I would have expected a year ago or 6 months ago. So I think the question is as we go into 2023, there is going to continue to be inflation. The environment is going to continue to be challenging, I think, from a macro standpoint. And so do you reach a point where maybe it does start to materialize around the consumer? Certainly, consumer sentiment out there remains depressed in many markets. But we're not seeing it right now. I think this goes back to what I said in the opening, though. We have to be very judicious. And our franchisees have been great about the pace of pricing, where we're just making sure that we're keeping the customer engaged and coming into our restaurants as we're working through the menu pricing. And we're today still seeing flow through on pricing in line with our historical numbers. So not seeing any big resistance right now. Maybe I'll just hook on to that a little bit because I think as Chris touched on, I mean, we're laser-focused on those 2 consumer-facing metrics and value for money and making sure we've got those affordable choices across our menu. And I think as Chris said, we're in a leadership position across the majority of our top markets in both of those metrics. And we know that even though those metrics have probably come down a little bit over the last 12 months or so on the back of higher pricing, the gap to the competitive set that we have has remained consistent. And so as Chris talked about, I think we've had a good discipline around pricing and making sure we keep that strong value for money in place.  I think the other thing that's important to highlight is we know that we're continuing to gain share across all of those key markets. And so another kind of proof point of, I think, how we're navigating and continue to resonate with consumers. I mean, I think at the end of the day, value for money is about the experience we deliver over the price we charge. And I think it goes back to what Chris touched on earlier that we've made a lot of investments over the last couple of years in the experience.  We've got a fully modernized estate. I think we've upped our game in terms of our marketing creativity and execution. We've invested a lot in our digital capabilities and interaction with consumers. And I think all of those strengths are coming together now. And I think our focus as we head into 2023 is really on making sure that each and every time consumers choose to come into one of our restaurants, we deliver them a great experience and continue to ensure that we earn those visits each and every time. Our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Maybe I'll just ask about the kind of 45% operating margin outlook for the year and the components of that. Do you think that as a result of kind of the Accelerating the Organization strategy that there will be some savings in G&A over time? Or is this just perhaps a reallocation? Would you expect to continue to see some leverage on the franchise margin side, for example? I guess I'm just trying to think through some of the drivers of that. Brian, yes, thanks for the question. Well, let me talk about, I guess, a couple of the pieces. I mean, when you think about operating margin, for sure, there are a couple of specific pressures that we're working through that we believe are short term in nature. Obviously, we've got that pressure on our company-operated margins from the inflationary pressures that we're working through. And so that's an impact. Obviously, we've got the incremental support we're providing to franchisees, which is an impact focused on 2023. So we'll have both of those pressures to work through this year.  I think in regards to G&A and ATO, I mean, as you heard in my opening comments, we expect G&A for the year to be between 2.2% and 2.3%. Any kind of outcomes -- and just a reminder on ATO is it's really focused on our ways of working, which the output is how do we get more efficient, how do we reallocate resource against innovation and growth and how do we make sure we're moving faster as an organization. So any of the outputs of ATO are kind of included in our 2023 guidance for G&A.  I think certainly, the best way to work through any kind of short-term pressures is to continue to make sure we're driving strong top line momentum, which I think our quarter 4 results reflect, and that's certainly our focus for 2023. And as we get through these short-term pressures, certainly believe that, that strong top line momentum will mean that we're beginning to drive greater leverage and operating margin and anything that's kind of dependent on sales as we go forward like G&A. And so I think we certainly expect to see that beyond '23. Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. So obviously, very strong U.S. comps. Can you talk about specifically what you saw with traffic and average check in the quarter and performance across dayparts, if there's anything notable there? And then just as it relates to share gains, what are you seeing with the lower-income consumer versus the high-income consumer? Yes. So focusing just on the U.S., I think what we saw from a performance standpoint was very balanced growth across the dayparts. So nothing particularly noteworthy there. Late night for us continues to be the opportunity just because of some changes that we've made around operating hours due to the staffing environment. But around kind of our core dayparts, that's been very strong.  We're also seeing strong growth on our core menu, particularly on chicken, where we've been gaining share -- quite a bit of share on chicken. We've gained about 1 point of share on chicken in the last year. And then if you think about beef, we're also continuing to grow our share in beef despite having a very strong presence in that already. So nice balanced growth with the U.S. Digital and delivery, of course, are driving outsized growth. So digital, if you look at digital transactions, up close to 40% in the U.S., which is above obviously the 25% -- or the 10%, rather, growth that we saw in Q4.  And then on the low-income consumer, I'd say the only thing that is probably noteworthy there is while the units per transaction is maybe down slightly, we're seeing a little bit of an uptick in frequency of visits. And so I think that's maybe something where the customer is coming in, being a little bit more cautious about how much they're ordering. They're probably spending to an absolute dollar amount, but we're seeing a little bit of an improvement around frequency with that low-income consumer. Maybe just I'll hook on a couple of additional kind of pieces of texture. I mean, I think if you look at the full year in the U.S., we were up about 10% from an average pricing standpoint. And as Chris talked about a little bit earlier, a couple of partial offsets to that. One is we continue to kind of see this reversion of order channels more to the kind of pre-COVID behavior. So of course, while delivery is still elevated, it's come back a little bit as customers kind of revert to more typical ordering channels. And then as Chris also touched on, you've got that -- maybe that more value-conscious, discerning kind of choice making that consumers are making. I think 2 things that are really important. I mean, value for money and affordability, which we've already talked to, we know we're in a really strong leadership position in the U.S. business. And I think the second thing is that on a comp basis, we continue to gain share. And I think those are both strong proof points of the fact that we're well positioned and the fact that we are in a position to ensure that we are affordable and accessible for our consumers despite their individual circumstances as we go forward. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Chris, following all the momentum in 2022 and really in recent years, could you talk a bit more about the biggest opportunities that you see as it relates to continuing to drive that guest count momentum in '23 and perhaps beyond? I don't know if it's the same in the U.S. as key global markets, but just curious how you'd kind of think about or rank order some of the opportunities that you've spoken to on the call. Yes. It really just goes back to the pillars that we have in our strategy. It's marketing, core menu and now the 4Ds. I think each of those still has quite a bit of runway of growth. I'm encouraged by what we're doing from a brand standpoint, but there's a lot more we can and will be doing on that to continue to strengthen our brand and marketing excellence. And we're still not as good as we could be around lifting and shifting great ideas around the world. And so we're going to get better at that through this Accelerating the Organization effort.  On core menu, chicken for us is a big opportunity as is coffee. I think on burgers, we're very well developed. But chicken and coffee, in particular, offer us, I think, a good growth opportunity. And we're going to be focused on that with some very specific products as opposed to having that maybe be something in the past that was a little bit more left to individual markets to kind of chart their course.  And then on the 4Ds, I think all of those for us have growth. So it's not a different playbook than what we're talking about with Accelerating the Arches. It's very much the same playbook. And what we're adding into the U.S. this year, as I mentioned in my comments in the opening, is on the operational side with PACE restarting. I've been very encouraged to see how PACE has been driving customer satisfaction when we put that in, and we're seeing improvement around service time. So you take all of the top line-driving initiatives related to the MCDs and you overlay on top of that improved operations or improved execution at the restaurant, and that gives me confidence in the outlook. Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. I wanted to sort of just ask about this -- some of these initiatives in the context of McDonald's history, which is to say, when -- you mentioned, Chris, that it's been since -- 2014 since you had unit growth in the U.S. As I recall, unit growth had picked up a few years before then, but same-store sales slowed. And so there has -- historically, it seems like there's maybe a trade-off there. So that was one sort of piece that I wanted to ask about and how you think about that balance.  And then related, Chris, when you joined, there was an initiative, I think, around reducing some of the management layers and really streamlining and making the lines of communication clear between the markets and the headquarters. I guess, what's happened since then? Or it feels like it's maybe a renewed initiative to do that. So if you could just compare perhaps where you were to what you're doing now and where the reinvestments might be this time versus the last time. Sure. I think on your first point around unit growth versus comp growth, we have to walk and chew gum. It's not one or the other. It's the 2 of them in combination. And I think the big difference is when you want to be growing units is when you've got strong comp sales because that reflects the underlying health of the business. I'm always very leery when I see someone out there putting a strong unit growth number without strong underlying comp sales because that's historically not been a good recipe in our industry.  And so for us, I think we've got, as you've seen in our results, strong comp sales. I feel very good about the outlook. And so that now gives to me permission to put on top of that some unit growth. But we need to be very smart about where and how we do that. And I think sometimes in the past, we were looking at just putting units and looking at an absolute number and not maybe looking at the quality of the site. And so that's why we want to take some time this year to make sure we feel confident about the exact number, the pacing, the quality of the site so that when we do roll that out that we've got the ability to continue to drive both comp sales as well as unit growth.  And then your question about the organization, there's maybe some similarities with differences. I think if you go back to what was done in -- I think it was 2016 or thereabouts, I mean, that was savings that largely came about through refranchising a big chunk of our restaurants. And so that was -- as we took McOpCo percentage down and we moved more of that to the franchise side, that gave us some benefits from a G&A standpoint. There were some changes that happened in terms of delayering at the senior level, but what that effort was not about is ways of working. That was much more kind of, what I would say, are just business model approaches as opposed to ways of working. And what I've seen in my time in this job and also what I've seen in the U.S. when I was in that role is that we have a lot of opportunities to get faster, more innovative, more efficient. And it's because we have historically been very decentralized in some areas where we reinvent the wheel way too often.  And I think the other thing that we've seen is we haven't been as sharp around our global priorities. And so there's been proliferation of priorities that sometimes happen at the market level. I would just give you an example. As we're going through this ATO exercise and learning about where we have the opportunities, we're uncovering all sorts of interesting things, like, for example, one market that has 300 priorities. Well, of course, you can't have 300 priorities, and you can't resource 300 priorities. And so as we discover and learn these things, this is all going to be about making us better.  So the difference of today versus what we did maybe back in 2016, I think that was much more of a structural change related to our franchising model with some delayering at the senior level. This is much more fundamental about changing ways of working that I think ultimately are going to make us better both on the top line but I think are also going to give us efficiencies that flow through, as Ian was talking about with G&A leverage. Our next question is from Jon Tower with Citi. Just curious, I know we've spoken quite a bit about some of the cost inflation and stuff like that running through the business across the globe in '23. Curious if you can give us an indication on your thoughts regarding pricing versus the inflation expectations for the full year and how you're working with your franchisees across the globe to address that. And then second, if you could talk about the quarter-to-date industry data, particularly in the U.S., it's been quite strong to start the year. Curious to know if some of the strength that McDonald's saw in the fourth quarter has carried over into the first quarter. Jon, let me start on that one. And maybe just to give a bit of texture to my answer, I'll talk about it in a couple of pieces. I'll start with the U.S. and then talk a little bit about IOM but maybe with a focus on Europe. I mean, I think in the U.S., we would say we're past the inflation peak and kind of heading on that downward slope. But certainly, we had high inflation, mid-teens in '22 from a food and paper perspective. I think in '23, we think our food and paper inflation is going to be kind of mid- to high single digits. So still obviously very elevated from where it's been for a long time. And so in combination with that, you've also got energy prices that are up and interest rates and things like that, that are impacting us.  I think if you move to IOM with a focus on Europe, I think we're still working through the peak period of inflation. I don't think -- we think inflation will -- in Europe will start to ease probably until mid-2023. In fact, we'll see some markets in Europe with higher levels of inflation in '23 than we saw in 2022. And so I would say on an IOM basis for '23, we probably expect food and paper inflation to be kind of in that mid-teens, not substantially lower than what we saw in '22. So I think that gives you an indication of the level of the inflationary pressure.  Of course, energy prices in Europe, maybe while they haven't hit the peak, as I was talking about earlier because we've had a warmer winter in Europe so far, I mean, the underlying tensions aren't fully resolved yet. And inflation levels and energy prices are certainly up significantly where they were 12 months or so ago. And so I think from a pricing perspective, what we're trying to do is be very disciplined and be very consumer-led in our thinking.  You may have heard me talk in the third quarter call just a little bit about the investments we've made over the last couple of years to really improve the tools, the data and the analytics that our advisers use to provide recommendations to the business. Of course, as always, our franchisees make their own pricing decisions. But I think as Chris talked about, we feel good that we're being very disciplined around the pricing we're taking. We're using a long-term mindset, knowing that what we want to continue to do is drive strong top line momentum so that we have that momentum through these pressures and then, of course, out of the pressures and begin to kind of recover margins and gain leverage as we go forward. And we think our system has done a really good job on that because when we look at our value for money and affordability scores, we continue to maintain those leadership positions. And so I think '23 is kind of a moment in time where we're seeing kind of the peaks of those pressures but feel really good as we get out of '23 that the momentum that we're going to continue to drive will keep us in a really strong position to start gaining leverage again. Yes. I just would add. I mean, I've seen some of the industry reports on the momentum heading into 2023, and we feel good about how our business is performing. But I think Ian touched on one thing. Just keep in mind, we've got Omicron, that's a tailwind. We've got good weather not just in Europe, but there's favorable weather in the U.S. So there are some things there that are helping, I think, industry-wide, but we feel very good about the momentum we're starting the year off with. Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Chris, you expressed the same macro concerns in Europe as last quarter. But within IOM, strong 4Q comps, the U.K., France and Germany were called out as really standout performers. And so you spoke about a few country-specific operating highlights. But can you talk about the degree that Europe is benefiting from trade-down from higher-priced dining and how you're positioning the business to sharpen the focus on value in 2023 while recognizing franchisee profitability in Europe is seeing the greatest challenge? And if I could just squeeze in one quick housekeeping question. How will the $100 million to $150 million of 2023 franchise release show up in the income statement? And if you anticipate that to be front half- or back half-weighted or spread evenly throughout the year, that would be helpful. Why don't I have Ian cover the housekeeping item, and then I'll get to your broader question about Europe and the consumer. Yes. Andrew, so just on the $100 million to $150 million, that obviously is directed to support franchisees. And so it would show up through our franchisee revenue in the income statement as we work through that. I'll give it back to Chris for the rest. Yes. And to the question about trade-down and the benefits of that, we're seeing good balanced growth in Europe and in our IOM markets. So I wouldn't say that we are disproportionately benefiting from some sort of trade-down. To the degree that we have visibility kind of at the different strata of the consumer, we're continuing to see that hold up well across sort of all consumer segments. I have time for one last question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. The question is on CapEx and just overall capital needs of the business. Certainly, appreciate the guide for fiscal '23 at $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, but that includes new units on 400 IOM and U.S. units. So I guess there's a couple of different parts to this. Do you think -- is that 400 number kind of the right number to think about in these developed markets going forward? Or could that number necessarily increase, I guess, is the first part?  Secondly, you did mention the completion of EOTF in the U.S. largely in '22. And I'm wondering if there's another large project, specifically, I guess, in the IOM markets, that may kind of take up for existing unit CapEx.  And finally, in the release, and I think this has been a really important thing for McDonald's 90% cash conversion, I mean, I suppose you mean of earnings, of your net earnings, I mean, is that the right ratio that you expect to hit on an annual basis going forward? Maybe getting a little bit of a preview of what you will talk about in -- later this year at your analyst meeting. John, thanks for all that. So I think on the 400 openings, as Chris said, we'll have more to say on that later in the year. But I think what we've done well over the last couple of years is really build demand for the brand by investing in the brand, I think in doing a good job to resonate with consumers. And so certainly feel there's opportunity ahead. I think from a quantification standpoint, we'll talk about that, as I said, more later in the year.  On '23, the $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion of CapEx, about half of that is going to go towards new unit growth. I would say one of the things as we worked through COVID and dealt with kind of consumer shifts in behavior was we certainly understood there was an opportunity for us to deal -- obviously, we've got a lot more ordering channels coming into the restaurants. I think that's certainly -- and with the demand and volume that we've created, has created some challenges just in managing the capacity and the volume of customers we're dealing with in some of our restaurants across our owned markets. And so some of that reinvestment CapEx is just going to us kind of working through these new ordering channels like delivery and digital and just enabling our restaurants to be better set up to deal with the volume of business that they're handling and to make sure that they can continue to grow volume by having more capacity available as we go forward. And so some of that capital is going there. I think on the 90%, I think you should feel good that that's something that we feel will be in place going forward, as we've talked about a 93% in terms of converting our net income to free cash flow. Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day. This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

         "Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, January 31, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Thanks, Michelle, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast.  Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise; Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.  Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclosure on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to begin today's call by recognizing the General Motors team, all of our employees and including our dealers and suppliers. It takes experience, skill and teamwork to adjust to external factors like higher interest rates, commodity price increases and supply chain disruptions and deliver our commitments year in and year out.  Our team rose to meet every challenge thrown at them in 2022, and they delivered record EBIT adjusted in a year of firsts that really sets us apart from our competition. For example, GM led the U.S. industry in total sales and delivered the largest year-over-year increase in market share of any OEM alongside record ATPs. This reflects the strength of our product portfolio, including our clear leadership in full-size pickups and full-size SUVs, great quality and improved availability. Chevrolet and GMC delivered more than 1.1 million full-size pickups, full-size SUVs and midsized pickups in the U.S., which is about 350,000 units more than our closest competitor.  Our commercial fleet business is another area of profitable market share. The team has earned the business of more than 300 major commercial accounts over the last several years, which led to our best year for commercial delivery since 2006. The inflection point was driven by our investment in midsize and full-size pickups, including our capacity expansions to build more crew cabs and heavy-duty pickups.  Our growing portfolio of EVs will enhance our strong sales and share performance across the board because we're targeting the most popular segments at multiple price points. This year, we will have 9 EVs in the market in North America, including the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, which saw record sales. In fact, they were the best-selling mainstream EVs in the second half of the year, and we plan to build more than 70,000 this year for North America and other markets.  Quality is another area where our team deserves recognition. In the latest J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study, GM improved, while the industry went backwards. Not only did we get better, GM and the Buick brand led the industry, Chevrolet had 6 top ranked vehicles and the Corvette was the highest ranked nameplate in the industry. This commitment to satisfying customers and delivering industry-leading quality helped our eligible U.S. hourly employees earned record profit sharing totaling $500 million, which brings the 3-year total to $1.2 billion.  Looking ahead, we expect that 2023 will be another strong year for GM. We expect to deliver EBIT adjusted in the range of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion which reflects operating performance similar to 2022, when you include the normalization of GM Financial's results and pension accounting.  Our guidance includes a total of $2 billion in cost savings in the automotive business over the next 2 years. The areas we're focusing on include continuing to reduce complexity in all of our products and reducing corporate overhead expenses across the board. I do want to be clear, though, we're not planning layoffs. We are limiting our hiring to only the most strategically important roles and will use attrition to help manage overall head count.  On the revenue side of the equation, we expect the new products in key segments will continue to support profitable growth. This includes the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, our first electric supercar and the quickest production Corvette in history; our new midsized Chevrolet Colorado and GMC pickups; our new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups; and the all-new Chevrolet Trax, which is the best entry-level Chevrolet we ever built.  We're especially excited about the Trax and so our dealers in North America, Korea and other international markets. The Trax really stands out in a segment where customers are often forced to sacrifice for a low price. But the Trax is stylish, roomy, packed with safety technology, and it's very affordable. It's combined city highway fuel economy is 30 miles per gallon, and it's also more profitable than the model it replaces.  The third-generation Chevrolet Montana pickup that we're launching in South America and Mexico starting next month follows the same formula. The Montana's design is inspired by products like the Blazer and Trailblazer, and it will offer customers more room, the best combination of fuel economy and performance in its segment and a comprehensive suite of safety features and an innovative reconfigurable bed. So let's talk about our growing EV portfolio. At our November Investor Day, we took you deep into the products and supporting strategies that will help us achieve solid EV profitability in 2025. And this is a breakout year for the Ultium platform. Production at our Ultium Cells joint venture in Ohio is on track and the plant in Spring Hill will open later this year. Ultium Cells started hiring and training launch team members in October, and they began equipment installation in November.  These plants will help us meet pent-up demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC HUMMER EV pickup and the BrightDrop Zevo 600, and it keeps our other EV launches on track. For example, BrightDrop continues to add new customers, including DHL Canada, and they are on track to achieve the goal of $1 billion in revenue for the year.  In April, we launched the Silverado EV Work Truck at Factory ZERO for fleets, so we have opened up the order banks to begin converting initial demand for more than 200 customers into firm orders for 2023 production with the first deliveries in the spring. Interest is so strong that we believe demand will exceed supply in 2023 and into '24.  In the fall, we will begin building the sold-out Silverado RST First Edition, Chevrolet's flagship electric pickup, which will feature trailering-capable Super Cruise, 4-wheel steering and a multi-flex midgate and up to 400 miles of range. We'll follow with other retail-focused models in' '24, including the Silverado EV Trail Boss.  This summer, we'll also see the launches of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV. More than 40% of Blazer's reservation holders are new to EVs. Among the 60% who have owned an EV or hybrid, most are either Tesla customers or are loyal Bolt EV and Volt customers. What's common to everyone is they want an all-electric SUV that's stylish and roomy with enough range and fast-charging capability to make it their daily driver, and they want it from a brand like Chevrolet with a proven record and reputation for quality.  The Equinox EV has many of the same attributes in an even more affordable package, which makes it unique and another growth opportunity for GM. More than 1/3 of the customers interested in the Equinox EV say affordability is their key consideration, and the latest data says nearly half live on the East or West Coast or in Texas, which are all growth markets for us.  This cadence of cell production and product launches, combined with strong demand for the Bolt EV and EUV keeps us on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 to mid-2024, and with the Ultium platform volumes increasing significantly in the second half of this year.  Our team in China is also scaling Ultium. The Cadillac LYRIQ, which was the first to launch in September, and our dealers are very excited about it. They delivered around 2,400 units through December with about 80% of customers coming from other manufacturers. Excitement is also building at Buick, which is now building preproduction units of the Buick Electra 5, an SUV inspired by the Electra-X concept. It will be the first in an all-new portfolio of Buick EVs.  All of these launches and initiatives will help us deliver near-term commitments we made at Investor Day, and we continue to make bold moves to drive profitable long-term growth. One example is our planned investment of more than $850 million in 4 U.S. plants to build the sixth generation of our small-block V-8, which will deliver even better fuel economy, about a 5% improvement and double-digit reduction in emissions and more performance for our truck and SUV customers.  We're also building an EV supply chain that is long-term competitive advantage for GM and a major source of new jobs, especially in North America. For example, our first 3 joint venture cell plants are expected to create 11,000 jobs in the U.S. with about 6,000 in construction and 5,100 in operations. In Quebec, construction of our joint venture cathode active material plant is moving quickly and the structure should be complete midyear. In Texas, MP Materials has started construction of its first rare earth metal alloy and magnet manufacturing facility, and they expect to begin delivering product to us late this year.  After several months of optimizing engineering and process parameters, Controlled Thermal Resources is now recovering lithium from its geothermal brine resource in California's Imperial County. This is an important step in completing the engineering design to recover lithium from geothermal brine at scale.  In Australia, Queensland Pacific Metals has secured all major approvals to begin construction of a new facility that will be an environmentally sustainable center for processing nickel and cobalt. In December, Ultium Cells signed a supply agreement with POSCO Chemical to support -- source artificial graphite from Korea. And today, we announced the largest ever investment by an automaker in battery raw materials. Specifically, we are making an equity investment of up to $650 million in Lithium Americas to help them develop the largest known lithium resource in the U.S. and the third largest globally. Lithium Americas estimates that the potential output from this project could support annual production of up to 1 million EVs and create 1,000 new jobs in construction and another 500 in operations.  Production is scheduled to start in the second half of 2026. And after our initial investment, GM will have exclusive access to the lithium offtake in the first phase of the project. It's a landmark transaction, and it certainly won't be the last major supply chain announcement for GM. We continue to pursue strategic supply agreements and partnerships to further secure our long-term needs and drive investment in the United States and across North America.  As I said, all of these launches and initiatives tie back to the road map we shared at Investor Day. We're executing a product strategy in ICE and EV that is designed to support strong pricing and grow our share, especially in EVs, by competing in multiple segments and price points. We're expanding domestic cell production to drive EV growth, and we are turning our EV supply chain into a powerful competitive advantage. And we're maintaining strong financial results during a period of high investments, which includes taking a very strategic approach to managing our costs.  Next, I would like to dedicate a few minutes to Cruise because 2022 was a very significant year for them as well. So Kyle, I'm turning it over to you. Thanks, Mary. Before I share more about the rapid scaling ahead of us for 2023, I'd like to take a minute to highlight what we accomplished in 2022. As you said, last year was the year that fully-driverless AVs transitioned from being a moonshot to reality, with the Cruise taxi fleet serving thousands of rides to real customers in a major U.S. market, and making its first fully-driverless deliveries.  We started the year with just a handful of cars on the road and a service that was restricted to employees. In January, though, we welcomed our first public riders and a few months later, launched our commercial service, the first ever in a major U.S. city. And since then, we're approaching 1 million driverless miles, have completed tens of thousands of driverless rides and run the largest driverless AV operation in the world, currently peaking at 130 driverless AVs at the same time in our Redhill fleet.  We scaled responsibly, safely and transparently, including the release of the most comprehensive safety report in the industry. It outlines the key tenets and processes we put in practice each day that make our products an obvious choice against a backdrop of tragedies on the road caused by human error.  We finished the year delivering on our promise, a bold one, to complete our first commercial driverless rides in Austin and Phoenix. In Austin, we went from 0 footprint to revenue-generating rides in just a few months, and this proves that our technology scales quickly to new regions with minimal modification to our investment. And I think at this point, it's fair to say that our focus on complex cities like San Francisco, doing that first has paid off, and we've opened the door to rapid scaling this year and beyond.  Looking ahead, this is the year when we really hone in on our key enablers for growth and profitability, with an amazing experience, low cost available everywhere. We're going to expand our service in both existing and new markets, and we'll have more to come on this soon. And we're working to ensure that our riders have an experience that is not only better than traditional ride-hail, but the best transportation experience possible.  The Origin will go into volume production later this year with closed course testing underway right now. And I can say after riding in an autonomous Origin myself, I can say that it's going to be hard to go back to the conventional vehicle format for an AV.  And as part of driving down costs and increasing availability, you'll also see us to continue to improve our operational efficiency and scale. And as an example, the most recent 100,000 driverless miles that we did clocked in 8x faster than the first 100,000 miles that we did, and we expect our rapid expansion to continue at similar rates this year and next.  Our operational efficiency also extends to how we spend our cash. We continually look for creative ways to reduce expenses, including more recently, increasing our use of automation, increasing our cloud compute efficiency and reducing our R&D real estate footprint. Our major investments in lower costs, vehicles and hardware, such as the Cruise Origin, better routing and pricing algorithms and operational efficiencies are going to drop costs and improve our unit economics as we scale to more cities, drive up revenue and continue our march toward profitability.  We will be thoughtful and focused with our spending, but we do intend to pursue the massive market opportunity in front of us by significantly increasing our commercial footprint and operating scale. It's abundantly clear that we have a massive opportunity ahead of us, and it's fully within our reach. We will continue to go after it with integrity and with urgency.  Thanks, Mary. Back to you. Well, thanks, Kyle. And now let me turn the call over to Paul, who's going to go into a detailed discussion of our results and our outlook. Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I also want to start my remarks by thanking the entire GM team. They remain focused on execution and consistently meeting our commitments, no matter the obstacles, and this is exactly what they achieved in 2022.  We generated full year revenue of $156.7 billion, representing strong year-over-year growth of 23%. This improvement was driven by the team overcoming numerous logistics challenges and collaborating with the supply chain to increase parts availability. As a result, we grew wholesale volumes 25% within our objective of 25% to 30% for the year. We continue to face some supply chain and logistics issues, but overall, things remain trending in the right direction.  For the full year, we achieved $14.5 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.2% EBIT-adjusted margins and $7.59 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were above the record profits we achieved in 2021 and at the high end of our revised EBIT-adjusted guidance range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion as December revenue and FX came in better than expected. They also speak to the robust health of our underlying business, which allowed us to offset $5.5 billion of commodity and logistics headwinds, $2 billion of incremental EV and growth spend and $1 billion lower GM financial results.  We generated adjusted free cash flow of $10.5 billion, which allowed us to both reinvest in growth opportunities and return excess cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased an additional $1 billion of stock, bringing the 2022 total to $2.5 billion and retiring 65 million shares. We also opportunistically early retired $1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the U.S. and $0.5 billion of unsecured term loans in GM International, both maturing in 2023. Our goal remains to be responsible stewards of your capital.  Getting into the fourth quarter results was $43.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year. We achieved $3.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 8.8% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.12 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were driven by solid unit volume growth of 30% year-over-year during the quarter and robust pricing. North America delivered Q4 EBIT adjusted of $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion year-over-year and EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.3%, primarily driven by higher volume and pricing, partially offset by mix and higher commodity and logistics costs.  Production in the second half of 2022 increased with strengthening supply chain and logistics, allowing us to improve dealer inventory for certain vehicles. We ended the year with total dealer inventory, including in-transit vehicles running around 50 days, with a number of vehicles physically on dealer lots improving gradually, but still approximately 1/3 of the level we were at in mid-2019, supporting a favorable supply and demand environment. I'd also like to share our perspective on inventory levels going forward. We're committed to actively managing production levels to balance supply with demand and are targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory on a portfolio basis. This is down 20 to 30 days from mid-2019 and is reliant on a continued improvement in logistical challenges the industry has faced.  Within this portfolio target, trucks are expected to run at higher levels, reflecting greater customer-driven variation requirements and sedans and SUVs are expected to run at this range or lower. Throughout the year, sales seasonality, production schedules and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time, but that is the targeted range at which we'll manage.  We continue to see strong demand for our EVs, with inventory turning on the Bolt EV and EUV in less than 10 days. The GMC HUMMER EV and Silverado -- Chevrolet Silverado EV have generated incredible demand and excitement, leading to over 250,000 combined reservations. We've also seen strong demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ, GMC Sierra EVs as well.  Order books for the model year '23 LYRIQ and Denali Edition 1 Sierra EV were quickly filled with a waitlist that is growing daily. When you add in the interest we've seen for the Equinox EV and the Blazer EV, over 0.25 million hand-raisers, our EV momentum will only build as we enter the largest segments in the world.  GM International delivered Q4 EBIT adjusted of $300 million, flat year-over-year as the team did an impressive job executing in a volatile environment. This included $200 million of equity income in China, down slightly year-over-year due to lower volume and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost actions. EBIT adjusted in GM International, excluding China equity income was $100 million, up slightly year-over-year and profitable in all 4 quarters. These consistent results were driven by favorable pricing and volume, partially offset by mix in commodity costs.  I want to take a moment and recognize the transformation this team has executed over the last few years, achieving over $2 billion of EBIT-adjusted improvement since 2018. This was done by exiting unprofitable markets, strengthening the portfolio, leveraging our strong brands to significantly improve pricing and mix, all while simultaneously driving down costs. They've done amazing work as a team, and they should be lauded for that.  GM Financial delivered strong results with Q4 EBT adjusted of $800 million, down $400 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income and higher cost of funds, partially offset by growth in the retail and commercial loan portfolios. Used vehicle prices have declined, but continue to run above the contract residual value with a Q4 off-lease return rate below 10%.  Overall, portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix, with net charge-offs up slightly due to moderation in credit performance, but still running below pre-pandemic levels. GM Financial paid dividends of $1.7 billion in 2022, and we expect similar dividends in 2023. Corporate expenses were $400 million in the quarter, flat year-over-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives and drive productivity. Cruise expenses were $500 million in the quarter, up $200 million year-over-year, driven mainly by modifications to equity awards, resulting in an accounting change in compensation expense. Our optimism continues to grow based on the great progress Cruise made in 2022 and their plans for rapid scaling and operationalizing of the business will result in a modest increase in costs during 2023.  Let's now look towards 2023 for GM overall, which I know is a key focal point for everyone. While the environment remains uncertain, at a high level, I'm pleased to report that when you exclude the impacts of lower pension income and GM Financial contribution, we expect to drive consistently strong core auto operating performance in 2023. This continues the trend we saw in 2022, and highlights the strong execution throughout the organization.  Our plan is to continue to prioritize growth initiatives such as Cruise and BrightDrop while investing to accelerate our transition to EVs to take advantage of our vertical integration and local sourcing strategies. Assuming a $15 million total industry volume and under current conditions, we expect EBIT adjusted in the $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $6 to $7 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $5 billion to $7 billion range.  At GM Financial, the strong credit performance in historically high used vehicle prices resulted in extraordinary results over the last 2 years. For 2023, we expect earnings to normalize in the mid-$2 billion range. We expect volume and mix combined to be a slight tailwind, with volumes up 5% to 10% year-over-year and mix partially offsetting as we continue to increase production in the sedan, small SUV and crossover segments, along with GM International volume growth.  Regarding North America pricing. While we anticipate incentives will increase from the record low levels we saw in 2022, we expect this headwind to be partially offset by realizing the full year benefit of MSRP increases on many model year '23 vehicles, particularly full-size SUVs and trucks as well as pricing we expect to achieve on our new launches in '23. We're also anticipating pricing actions outside North America, primarily to help offset FX headwinds.  Overall, we see commodities and logistics costs as a slight tailwind. Our longer-term steel and logistics contracts, which help protect us from higher market costs over the last 2 years, renewed at higher rates in the second half of last year. This, combined with the strategic initiatives to locally sourced battery raw materials is expected to largely offset the tailwind we're seeing from lower raw material prices on our spot and indexed exposures.  The $1 billion lower pension income impacts our fixed costs. This noncash item does not impact our core operating results, but will be a headwind when comparing year-over-year in 2023. As Mary mentioned, we are very focused on keeping automotive controllable fixed costs in check despite our growth initiatives, which is why we are announcing a cost reduction program to take out $2 billion of costs over the next 2 years.  Included in our guidance is the expectation to achieve 30% to 50% of that in 2023 and the remainder in 2024. This initiative is a result of several factors and demonstrates our continued commitment to closely manage our operations through this transformation and achieve North American margins in the 8% to 10% range through 2025.  We expect capital spend to be in the $11 billion to $13 billion range, inclusive of $1 billion invested in our Ultium Cells JV. We continue to shift resources to EVs, with around 75% of our product-specific capital dedicated to EVs and AVs. Even with the increase in capital spending, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to remain strong in 2023.  As we said back in November, we expect that clean energy tax credits will be a material tailwind for GM over time because of the work we've been doing on vertically integrating the supply chain. For 2023, we anticipate at least $300 million in EBIT-adjusted benefit and expect this tailwind to increase significantly over the next few years as our cell production ramps and our North America focused supply chain comes fully into place.  We're closely monitoring the dynamic macro environment as well as customer demand to make sure we're appropriately matching supply with demand. We will take quick and decisive actions on both the supply and the cost side to actively manage the business. What gives us confidence in our 2023 and long-term objectives is the work we've already done to position ourselves for success, repeatedly executing on our commitments and our ability to manage through a very challenging and dynamic environment.  With a compelling EV and ICE product portfolio, long-term supply chain commitments, extraordinary manufacturing capabilities, a strong balance sheet and our amazing team, I'm confident we'll continue to enhance the customer experience and deliver compelling growth on both the top and the bottom line. Mary? Okay. So with that, I think we're ready to, operator, to start taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush. Yes. Great quarter. Can you just talk about supply in terms of that battery lithium perspective? It just seems like you guys are being much more aggressive, making sure you have that supply through 2025. Just talk about some of those efforts, and just giving you more and more confidence on the sort of the EV targets over the coming years. Yes. Dan, I'm really proud of what the team has done. Our collaborative effort across supply chain, finance, business development, have led to what I think is the strongest portfolio of battery raw materials going forward. We've fully secured all of our battery raw materials through 2025. And as you can see from the announcement today with the investment in Lithium Americas and the supply that we'll be able to get from the Thacker Pass, we're making rapid improvements and increases in our battery raw materials for 2026 and beyond. That is core to our strategy, what we've done. We've talked about being creative because what we're really trying to do is to create a portfolio that is in it for the long term. So whether it's a combination of spot price movements, fixed-price contracts, across the board, we're looking at ways to creatively manage that and make sure that we're running it as a partnership. We want our partners to be successful too, especially in this space as we're developing new sources of these raw materials. And this is such a great example of that partnership mentality coming to fruition. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously, price cuts that we've seen in Tesla, Ford, but it doesn't seem like GM is going down that path. Can you just hit on that concept because that's a big focus of investors? Sure. When we look at our strong product portfolio and the interest that we have at the prices that we've already announced, we feel that we're well positioned. Even going into the first month of the year, we've seen a very strong customer interest in our products. And so we think right now, we're priced where we need to be. Of course, we're going to monitor it, and we'll make sure we remain competitive, but we really think with the strength of our product portfolio and what we have coming, we're positioned well. And our next caller is Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Just wanted to maybe just first follow up on Dan's question. Look, I know based on the prices that you've laid out for Equinox, Blazer, LYRIQ, that demand for the near term is much greater than your ability to supply. But at the same time, you're only assuming double -- or low single-digit EBIT margin for EVs by mid-decade, and one of your peers is already at 20% growth and pretty healthy EBIT and their costs are still falling. So my question is whether there are changes that you're contemplating or that you could make to close in on that benchmark and generate similar margins any faster. Rod, it's Paul. Thanks for the question. Thanks for being on. I think -- it's important to note that as we look across the competitive landscape, that competitor you referenced wasn't there in the beginning either, right? There's a lot of scaling that we're doing across the board. So as we're running concurrent operations with ICE and EV, there's obviously some frictional cost on utilization, et cetera, that we expect to be able to scale as we go through this transformation. The ICE portfolio remains really strong, but we're also building the EV factories for the future. And clearly, the production levels that we see now and as we're ramping up aren't there yet. So we expect a tremendous level of operational synergies. We're also going to manage the business aggressively. I think the $2 billion cost reduction program that we're announcing today is a strong testament to that and making sure that we're driving efficiencies we ramp up those productions. So it's not a -- I don't think a direct apples-to-apples comparison, but one that we're obviously aware of on the pricing front. The demand is really, really strong for all of our vehicle programs going forward. And we feel good about where we're going and the trajectory that we're on. Okay. And just secondly, you referenced that $2 billion cost savings. What does that mean for structural cost expansion? And maybe related to that, this 5% to 10% volume assumption that you've suggested would seem to imply that you don't see affordability or rates as a major impediment to growth at this point. Am I interpreting that correctly? Or are you in fact making more room for pricing with this cost saving assumption? I would characterize it a little bit differently, Rod. So success is going to be driven by when we look at our fixed cost lines being down $2 billion. That's what we're looking for across the board, and we can get there. And I think it comes across all areas of the business. What I would say is we're being prudent about what we see out in the macro environment. Again, we continue to see strength in demand for our vehicles and strength in pricing. But we want to make sure that we're driving efficiency where we can and felt like this was the right time to be able to do that. So we're going to be measured in how we do it. We're still focused on the growth areas of the portfolio. But we recognize that there are ways that we can do things more efficiently, and we expect to be able to drive that into margin performance. We're not doing anything to prepare for a price war or we're not doing anything in anticipation of a recession. I would say it's prudent cost management and just being aware of what's around us. That number is net, Paul, the $2 billion cost savings? Or is that a gross savings objective? Net of? Well, in other words, is there -- are your structural costs expected to decline by $2 billion expansion, I guess, is a simple way to ask it? Or is that -- are there other things that are increasing to offset that? For our automotive business, we're expecting our structural cost to go down $2 billion. And our next caller is Itay Michaeli from Citi. Congratulations. Just 2 questions on the outlook. First, can you maybe share kind of what you're expecting for the company's revenue growth in 2023? Do you just kind of want to calibrate that with the 12% CAGR for 2025? And secondly, I was hoping you could also maybe quantify the drag this year from some of the investments like the Ultium ramp and some of the other investments that you're making as well. It sounds like while the guidance certainly looks robust, there's certainly a lot of investments still flowing through. So I was hoping maybe you could quantify that as well. And then maybe also just provide a quick update on the Lordstown ramp as well. So Itay, you're -- you were a little garbled so let us try. I'll take the last one. The ramp at Ultium in Lordstown, Ohio is on track, going well. The team is really ramping up, really focused on quality and the 2, between LG Energy Solutions and General Motors working really well together. So I'm very pleased. As I mentioned, Spring Hill is also on track as is Michigan. And those 3 plants are really what enables us to achieve the goals that we've set for getting to 2025 and 1 million units in North America. So that's all going really, really well. From a -- I think the middle question you had was about with the investments that we're making in Ultium, to quantify, I think we've talked about what those investments are, but they're part of our capital program that we announced last year, this year and going into next year. So that's part of it. And on... The first one was on the revenue growth, Itay. So I'll just jump in and say that we obviously experienced pretty significant revenue growth in 2022 driven by 25% increase in wholesale. We're not expecting that similar jump in production in 2023. So we're not giving any specific revenue guidance, but I would say that we would expect the growth rate to be below 2022 levels. And our next caller is John Murphy with Bank of America. Just a first question, Mary, on the IRA. I mean there's a lot going on with the interpretation and the final rules being set here. Originally, it looked like GM was going to be relatively advantaged, just the way that you were set up on production and your supply chain. But some of the interpretations on the commercial vehicle side and the fact that lease vehicles may fit the bill of being commercial vehicles, that may open the door to Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, South Koreans, anybody shipping EVs into the U.S. and still getting that $7,500 credit. So just curious what your thoughts are on that, how you think the rules should be interpreted. And could there be a chance of this loophole or change stays in force that you might ship EVs in from China? So our strategy all along for a very long time has been to build where we sell. And I think when you look at the work that we've done with the battery plants in this country and all of this supply investments that we've made, that helps us have, I'll say, supply chain resiliency more so. And it gives us the opportunity with some of the deals we've made to, I think, have a better cost advantage. And also it's good for the country and creates jobs. And that's what IRA was meant to do. And so we're waiting to see what the final rules are going to be from treasury. I think regardless of some of the issues still to be clarified from a lease perspective, General Motors is still going to benefit greatly because if you look at the production tax credits from cells and module perspective and then where we'll be from a battery component and critical minerals, we think we're well positioned. Again, the deal that we announced today or the partnership, the equity investment, I think, continues to reinforce it. So yes, we're waiting to see what is going to be, but our focus is on having a strong supply chain here. Obviously, when we get the final rules, we'll look because we do have a global footprint, but I think we're focused on supporting North America production primarily from North America and to a certain extent, from Korea. So again, we're waiting to see, but I think you have to go back to what the intent of IRA was. Yes. I agree with you. Just one follow-up. You mentioned fleet sales as an opportunity. Fleet sales have been very low for the past couple of years. I mean, fleets have been very under satiated or not satiated at all on their demand function. And now that supply is becoming more normal, how big a part of a recovery do you think they could have in the market, just maybe in general? Where have they been for GM in '21, '22? And where do you think they might be in '23? And how big a part did that play in sort of the development of EVs profitably into fleets in the early stages of the EV ramp? Well, I think it's an important part. And I think when you look at BrightDrop, it's just all growth opportunity for us. I think when you look at the Silverado EV Work Truck, I think that's going to be very important as well. And so we're going to make sure that as we grow our fleet commercial rental business, it has an appropriate profitability profile, not from the days 10, 15 years ago when we really stepped back from that. But I think whether it's what we announced with Hertz and the number of customers that we have interested, every company is working to reduce their carbon footprint. And so the EVs that we have just help support that I think are going to be very strong, and I think we're going to have a good portfolio. So I think that allows us to grow, especially in areas where we weren't involved in the past, EVs is a fresh start there. I'm sorry, if you were to think about that 5% to 10% increase in wholesale volumes, would that be dominated by fleet? I'm just -- because I mean everybody is obviously very concerned about the retail customer at the moment, but really neglecting that 1/4 of this market is traditionally fleet, and it's 10% to 15% in the last couple of years. So I mean, the potential doubling in fleet volume, it could come in the market at large and maybe be very supportive of that wholesale increase. So I mean, could you give us some numbers or thoughts on how supportive that could be, that 5% to 10% wholesale increase? I think when we talk about a 5% to 10% increase, we're talking across the board. When you look at the EV launches that we have, the fact that we have brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups, the fact that we have the new midsize, which is just an outstanding midsized truck with the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon as well as the Trax. So we think from an ICE perspective, we have an opportunity. We think from clearly, the EV ramp-up that we're going to have this year, it's a part of it. And some of that -- both of those exciting products will be in the fleet business. So I think it's a both answer, John, not a single one or the other. Our next caller is Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. With regard to the $300 million tailwind you are assuming from clean energy tax credits in '23, I heard you say this could grow substantially over time. I just wanted to check in, try to dimension that potential. Are you assuming a benefit of $35 per kilowatt hour or $45? And are you in a position yet to share or have you resolved internally with your JV partner how these tax benefits are expected to be shared between GM and LG? I'm just trying to dimension if the opportunity is 1 million vehicles in 2025, times $45 per kilowatt hour or $35, and then to understand whether we need to split that amount 50-50 or if there's some other math we need to take into account. Yes. So Ryan, a lot of detail in your question. I'll take it back to what we said at Investor Day was we expect EV benefits -- tax benefits to be $3,500 to $5,500 per vehicle. The $300 million in 2023 is obviously a function of our ramp rate, of our cell production. We're not going to go into any details on how that works across the board. It's our best expectation of where we're going to land is at least $300 million this year and ramping up rapidly as our production increases across our Ultium plants. Our next caller is James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Just on -- back to GMV pricing relative to the market in North America, how would you assess GM's price competitiveness? Given the latest moves by competitors, it's it sounds as though demand in your order books are quite full. But just given the more recent competitive responses by others, would be curious to get your take whether your GMC is the opportunity to reposition or we also have the IRA defined MSRP caps as well to consider. Sure. Well, I think that's the strength of what General Motors is planning to launch this year. Many of the products that we have are going to be below the caps because we have a full portfolio of EVs at multiple price points. When you think about the Equinox EV, the Blazer EV and then the Silverado as well as the LYRIQ, I think we're really well positioned. And these are brand-new products into the marketplace that we have really strong interest. So that's why both Paul and I feel that right now, based on the interest and the fact that the pricing that we put out even before the IRA came out was very appropriate. We're going to -- and because of the strength of the Ultium platform, that's what enables us to do that along with the fact that we're ahead of -- from most of the, I'll say, the traditional OEMs and getting battery cells produced in this country. So I think if you look at the strategy we've been executing, we're well positioned. And the strength of our product portfolio, I think, is what is giving us the confidence of where we sit right now with feeling that we priced appropriately. Understood. And then just within the 400,000 cumulative EV production target by the first half of next year, can you just dimension what portion of that would be your EV truck platform? We haven't provided that kind of specific analysis, but the fact that -- well, the HUMMER to begin with, and that will ramp significantly this year and even more next year as we're completely sold out. And then the Silverado that we think we're going to -- the Silverado EV Work Truck and then the RST comes at the -- toward the end of the year. I mean I think all of those are very significant products that are going to do very well, but we're not giving specific numbers. Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Is GM considering changes to its longer-term battery plans for North America as there have been media reports recently suggesting both that GM is considering adopting cylindrical cells and also that GM and LG may not partner on a fourth battery plant? So first, one of the strong points of the Ultium platform is that it's chemistry agnostic, and it can take pouch, prismatic or cylindrical cells. And so we can look to what is going to be the right battery for the specific vehicle from a performance perspective. So we have that complete flexibility. We have very important work going on with LG Energy Solutions. They're an incredibly important partner to us. And we're working well together as we mentioned, with the launch of the Orion -- or excuse me, the Lordstown plant and then Spring Hill and then the plant in Michigan. So we're working well together, and we are going to need a fourth plant and more plants beyond that. And as we have those details to share, we will share them. But right now, there's nothing that's really changed in our plan to have battery manufacturing capability here in the U.S. and broadly in North America as well. That's helpful. My second question was on Cruise, and congratulations on the expansion into the new geographies last year. As you think about 2023 and how you're planning to expand, could you elaborate a bit more on your expansion targets for Cruise? And any potential changes in San Fran given the recent feedback from the local government there? Kyle, do you want to take that one? Yes, sure. I can take that. So we will be expanding in 2023 to several new cities, but our current focus is on expanding our driverless service in San Francisco as well as in Phoenix and Austin following our initial driverless launches there. The initial deployments in Phoenix and Austin were modest, and we want to expand those very quickly. And of course, by doing that, expanding into these new cities using this repeatable playbook we've developed across safety and operations and some of the technical features. The barriers to launching in these cities can drive growth in existing markets are much smaller because of that upfront work we've put into solve those really difficult barriers to scale first. And I think your second question was on the SFMTA comments about our California Public Utilities Commission permit to expand. And I just want to say there that our safety record is publicly reported and includes having driven millions of miles in an extremely complex urban environment with 0 life-threatening injuries or fatalities. And we're really proud of that record and also that the overwhelming majority of public comments on our permit application, including advocates from the disability community, small businesses and local community groups support expanding our fleet in San Francisco. Our next caller is Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. I just want to follow up on Mark's question about the -- about Ultium and the form factor. I appreciate that there's room for flexibility. And you've mentioned in the past, Mary, that the Ultium system was kind of form factor and chemistry agnostic. But if you did change to cylindrical, the 4680 form factor as reported in some of these sources, what kind of thing would drive such a change? I'm not saying that you have made that decision, but it seems like it is potential -- there's potential to do that. What kind of -- would it be driven by safety or cost? And kind of how difficult would it be to make that flip? So first of all, I'm not going to comment on speculation, Adam. And by the way, hello, but we -- we're looking really at performance. I mean one of the things, when you look at with the way that you configure the packs within Ultium, the difference of the cells is a lot having to do with performance and how do we get the max benefit. Again, our team has been working and looking at all 3 cell form factors for a while. In fact, today, from a prismatic perspective, that's what's in the vehicles, the Ultium-based vehicles that we're launching like the LYRIQ and the Buick in China. So we all along have been looking at all 3 form factors. And I just had a follow-up for Paul on the pricing. You mentioned higher incentives, but offset by the increase in -- step-up in the MSRPs. I just want to make sure we're interpreting that correctly, that those are kind of a wash, that you think one more or less compensates for the other to leave the pricing element more or less stable from '22 to '23. Is that -- is that the correct way to think about it broadly? I know it's a volatile environment, but just one as a starting point, is that the message, a wash? Yes. I would say order of magnitude, yes. The pricing increases, we're not contemplating big ones this year, rather the annualization of what we did last year across the board. We have some new launches that would kind of come in. We won't get specific on that. But we are assuming that there's going to be some steady increase, normalization of incentives. That's where we said we're trying to plan conservatively.  What I'll tell you is January month has come in really, really strong, a continuation of what we saw in December. And we're just watching the environment around us, but we still feel good about where demand sits. And our next caller is Chris McNally with Evercore. I just want to revisit Ryan's question on the IRA $300 million, and thanks so much for giving that number. Just our math is that, that would be something like 10 to 12 gigawatts from the 2 facilities in Ohio and Tennessee. And without sort of confirming the explicit math, can we just talk about maybe how long it may take to ramp Ohio? And then obviously, Tennessee is only starting at the end of this year, but I think they're about 40 gigawatts each. So it seems like there is a material amount to grow at that capacity growth. But just anything you could talk about the time line on Ohio and Tennessee giga? Yes. So the plan was we started in fourth quarter, and we said a couple of earnings calls ago that Ohio would add 20% more capacity every quarter. So to be fully up and running by the end of the year, that plan is still on track. I think you'll see us follow a similar but maybe a little faster in Spring Hill because we already have all the experience. And we actually have people from Spring Hill at the Ohio facility right now to make sure we have a smooth start-up there. So -- and we've talked about the plan is roughly around 37, 40. So I think you're in the right ballpark. But that's how those plans for ramp will ramp up. Perfect. That's super helpful. And just a follow-on, just from a modeling perspective, should we assume the 300 flows through EBIT? Or is there any benefit that also is going to start to benefit taxes as well? It's more where we're going to see the benefit of IRA if it's only in EBIT or if there is actually some tax component as well. We think that there will be some that kind of flows through both. Our deck has guide on a lower tax rate of 16% to 18% for 2023. That's largely driven by R&D credits and some IRA. We're not getting any specifics into the breakout between them until we see the regs written, and we get more definition around it. But we do expect that there are likely going to be components in both areas. And our last question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Two fairly quick ones. First one is back on pricing. I think you said you're trying to be conservative in your assumptions. So I was just hoping you could be a little bit more specific or explicit around what sort of incentive environment you're assuming because I understand the MSRP going up, just not super clear from the outside, what sort of macro and/or industry environment you're assuming and the impact on the overall industry incentives. Yes, Emmanuel, so nothing specific to guide on in terms of our forward incentives beyond. We do expect over time for incentives to increase from the sort of record low levels that we've seen. We've seen slight upticks, but I would say that's largely more of a function of interest rates than it is waning demand or inventories. Inventories still remain very tight. We expect that to be the case, especially grounded inventory at dealers through 2023. So while we see some normalizing of incentives, nothing more specific than that, that we'll guide to. Okay. So then just affirming it in terms of macro environment, if that's okay. Are you assuming some sort of recession in the second half, impact on sort of like consumer demand for vehicles? Or are you assuming sort of current conditions continue? And then I just have a follow-up on free cash flow. Yes. So again, this is a situation we're watching carefully. But what we see from a new vehicle consumer is a consumer, as Paul said, even in the month of January, we've seen it to be very strong. So we're going to continue to monitor that and take the necessary steps. But we're going to watch and learn as we go through the year. We told you at Investor Day, we were going to be as we plan this year, but also position ourselves to take advantage of whatever the market ends up being, and we're still on that plan executing. But again, from an early read in January, it's pretty positive. Okay. And then just quickly on free cash flow. Can you just provide a high-level walk between the 2022 strong performance into 2023? Because obviously, the 2 sort of elements you would exclude to make them comparable, the pension income, this is noncash, right? So yes, walk between '22 and '23 would be helpful. Yes, just really high level, $10.5 billion in 2022. At the midpoint, we've got a couple of billion dollars more of CapEx going forward, and probably not as much of a working capital build as we saw in 2022. That's high level, how you get to the 5% to 7%. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Great. Well, thank you, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for your questions. We, at General Motors, are really excited about the opportunities ahead of us in '23, especially with all the new vehicles that we're launching. Chevrolet and GMC will build on their leadership and pickup trucks, and Chevrolet is giving customers around the world compelling entry-level products, too. And this is the breakout year for the Ultium platform. So when you look at the products we'll have by the end of this year, again, they're all outstanding.  Again, we expect another year of strong financial results, and our confidence reflects the determination of the GMT -- of the GM team, the strength of our vehicles we're delivering and the valuable relationships we've developed with our dealers, our suppliers and our other partners. So I hope you see with what we did in '22 and what we're indicating we're going to be able to achieve in '23, that we continue to have your confidence, and we look forward to continuing to tell you more about this year as we go forward. So I hope everyone has a great rest of day. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining."

         "Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President, Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.  On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted.   We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we'll refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.  Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.  During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya. Thank you very much, Brett. I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear. Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we are now seeing them optimize that spend. Also, organizations are exercising caution, given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And the next major wave of computing is being born as we turn the world's most advanced AI models into a new computing platform.  In this environment, we remain convicted on 3 things. This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers, helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long-term loyalty and share position while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This, in turn, sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase. And lastly, we're going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts.  With that as a backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now I'll highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today's economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we're still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity.   As an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20% by migrating to Azure and reduced IT provisioning time from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust and PayPal.   Now on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently while meeting regulatory requirements. And ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers.  Now on to AI. The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing nonlinear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It's being used by customers and partners like OpenAI to train state-of-the-art models and services, including ChatGPT.   Just last week, we made our Azure OpenAI service broadly available, and already over 200 customers from KPMG to Al Jazeera are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time. And yesterday, we announced the completion of the next phase of our agreement with OpenAI. We are pleased to be their exclusive cloud provider, and we'll deploy their models across our consumer and enterprise products as we continue to push the state-of-the-art in AI.  All of this innovation is driving growth across our Azure AI services. Azure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100% for 5 quarters in a row with companies like AXA, FedEx and H&R Block choosing the service to deploy, manage and govern their models.  Now on to developers. Modernizing applications is mission-critical to any company's operations today. And with GitHub, Visual Studio and Azure PaaS services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools to help. GitHub is now home to 100 million developers and GitHub Copilot is the first at-scale AI product built for this era, fundamentally transforming developer productivity. More than 1 million people have used Copilot to date. This quarter, we brought Copilot to businesses, and we have seen strong interest and early adoption from companies, including Duolingo, Lemonade and Volkswagen's CARIAD Software Group.  Now on to Power Platform. Power Platform is becoming an essential digital transformation tool as every business looks to streamline their operations and drive productivity in today's environment.  We are helping customers realize superior time to value with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools, automation, virtual agents and business intelligence. We are leading in robotic process automation. Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers from AT&T to Rabobank, up over 50% year-over-year. And we are making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows.  Now on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is taking share as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience and supply chain functions. For example, J&J, Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service. Fujifilm is optimizing its operations. Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence. Baylor Scott & White in Texas is using our digital contact center to enhance patient communications. And this quarter, we introduced our new Supply Chain Platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. Now on to Industry Solutions. Our industry and cross-industry clouds are driving pull-through for our entire tech stack. Our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF last week as we introduced new tools to help retailers manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores. Polish retailer Zabka has built the largest chain of autonomous stores in Europe with the help of our technology. In Financial Services, our new partnership with London Stock Exchange Group will deliver next generation of data analytics and workspace solutions. And in health care, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any provider looking to generate real value from AI, with Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, physicians can reduce documentation time by half, improving the quality of their patient interactions.  Now on to systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams and Viva are essential for every organization to adapt to the new world of work. Microsoft 365 is rapidly evolving into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications as well as new applications like Designer, Stream and Loop. We have more than 63 million consumer subscribers, up 12% year-over-year, and we introduced Microsoft 365 Basic, bringing our premium offerings to more people.  Teams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter, showing durable momentum since the pandemic, and we continue to take share across every category from collaboration to chat to meetings to calling. Teams has emerged as a first-class platform. Apps from Adobe, Atlassian, Polly, ServiceNow and Workday have each surpassed 0.5 million active users, and the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40% year-over-year. There are more than 500,000 active Teams Rooms devices, up 70% year-over-year, and the number of customers with more than 1,000 rooms doubled year-over-year.  Novo Nordisk will deploy Teams Rooms to 5,000 meeting rooms globally in our largest deal to date. Teams Phone continues to take share and is the market leader in cloud calling. We have added more than 5 million PSTN seats over the last 12 months alone. With Teams Premium, we are meeting enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered recaps. We have seen strong interest in preview and we will make it broadly available next month.  With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience and organizational productivity. U.S. Bank is using Viva to streamline employee communications, and Carlsberg turned to Viva to centralize its digital employee experience for 29,000 employees. In today's environment, aligning the entire organization and the most important work is critical. Viva Goals brings objectives and key results directly into the flow of daily work.  Viva has also become an indispensable tool for business process. Viva Sales is the super app in Microsoft 365 for sellers. We have seen strong interest since making it generally available this quarter. All-up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365. 80% of our enterprise customers use 5 or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, IKEA, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto as well as the State Government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics.  Now on to Windows. While the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre-pandemic with time spent per PC up nearly 10%. Monthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter. And for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition.  We're also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over 2/3 year-over-year. Leaders in every industry from Campari and Grant Thornton U.K. to Nutrien and Woolworths are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500.  Now on to security. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms. We're the only company with integrated end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management and privacy informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day. We are taking share across all major categories we serve. Customers are consolidating on our security stack in order to reduce risk, complexity and cost.  The number of organizations with 4 or more workloads increased over 40% year-over-year. U.K. retailer Frasers Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft. Roku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory. And Astellas Pharma, Ferrovial and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIEM capabilities.  Now on to LinkedIn. People and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members. Three members are signing up every second. Over 80% of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10x year-over-year.  Skills are the new currency and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles in industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages, and companies are also turning to a skills-based approach in place of degree or pedigree to identify qualified talent, with more than 45% of the hires on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe and trusted platform.  Now on to advertising. Despite headwinds in the ad market, we continue to innovate across our first- and third-party portfolios. Our browser, Microsoft Edge gained share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Bing continues to gain share in the United States, and daily users of our Start personalized content feed increased over 30% year-over-year. We are now empowering retailers and expanding our third-party inventory.  With PromoteIQ, we are building a complete omnichannel media platform for companies like the Australian retailer, Endeavor, as well as Canada's Hudson's Bay. And Globo, the largest Brazilian TV broadcaster, chose Xandr to launch a new media buying platform in that market.  Now on to gaming. In gaming, we continue to pursue our ambition to give players more choice to play great games wherever, whenever and however they want. We saw new highs for Game Pass subscriptions, game streaming hours and monthly active devices, and monthly active users surpassed a record 120 million during the quarter. We continue to invest to add value to Game Pass. This quarter, we partnered with Riot Games to make the company's PC and mobile games, along with premium content available to subscribers.  And finally, we are energized by our upcoming lineup of AAA game launches, including exciting new titles from ZeniMax and Xbox Game Studios, and we'll be sharing details and game play at our showcase tomorrow.  In closing, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers and partners. We will continue to pursue our long-term opportunity and innovation agenda with urgency while also raising the bar on our operational excellence. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy. Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by reiterating Satya's thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week's announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion and earnings per share by $0.12.  Our second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2% and 7% in constant currency. When adjusted for the charge, gross margin dollars increased 2% and 8% in constant currency; operating income decreased 3% and increased 6% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $2.32, which decreased 6% and increased 2% in constant currency.  In our consumer business, the PC market was in line with our expectations, but execution challenges impacted our Surface business. Advertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. In our commercial business, we delivered strong growth in line with our expectations. However, as you heard from Satya, we are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment and we saw results weaken through December.  We saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the stand-alone Office 365, EMS and Windows commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.  From a geographic perspective, we saw strong execution in many regions around the world. However, performance in the U.S. was weaker than expected. Importantly, we continue to see share gains in areas such as data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security and Edge. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates, and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new stand-alone business noted earlier.  Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 29% and 26% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 24% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 32%. Our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points, in line with expectations. At a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by 6 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. FX impact on Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing were both in line with expectations. Additionally, FX decreased both COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations.  Microsoft Cloud revenue was $27.1 billion and grew 22% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point better than expected, driven by lower energy costs. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by sales mix shift to Azure.  Company gross margin percentage was 67%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points, driven by a lower mix of Windows OEM revenue and sales mix shift from licensing to cloud. Operating expense, when adjusted for the Q2 charge, increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, about $500 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by investments in cloud engineering, the Nuance acquisition and LinkedIn.  At a total company level, headcount ended December 19% higher than a year ago. Sequential headcount growth was less than 1%. Year-over-year growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Adjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points, primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact as well as a lower mix of OEM revenue.  Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7% and 13% in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier. Office Commercial revenue grew 7% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 11% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 12% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although we saw some impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier.  Office Consumer revenue declined 2% and increased 3% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 63.2 million, partially offset by declines in our transactional business. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 14% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions, partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier.  Dynamics revenue grew 13% and 20% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 21% and 29% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings.  Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, including roughly 5 points from the Q2 charge. Operating income increased 6% and 17% in constant currency as the 3 points of favorable impact due to the change in accounting estimate were offset by 3 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier.  Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $21.5 billion, increasing 18% and 24% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 20% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% and 38% in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate, particularly in December, and we exited the quarter with Azure constant currency growth in the mid-30s.  In our per user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 16% to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 2% in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 2% and 7% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs.  Operating expenses increased 34% and 37% in constant currency, including roughly 13 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and roughly 7 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 7% and 15% in constant currency, as roughly 7 points of favorable impact of the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately 7 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge.  Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19% and 16% in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial and Search. Windows OEM revenue decreased 39% year-over-year, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 36% on a strong prior year comparable. Devices revenue decreased 39% and 34% in constant currency, below expectations due to execution challenges on new product launches.  Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue declined 3% and increased 3% in constant currency, lower than expected, primarily due to the slowdown in growth of new business and stand-alone offerings noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, a bit lower than expected, as noted earlier. Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly 6 points of benefit.  And in gaming, revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 12% and 8% in constant currency, given the strong first-party content last year. Segment gross margin dollars declined 29% and 24% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 7 points year-over-year, driven by lower device gross margin and sales mix shift to lower-margin businesses.  Operating expenses increased 6% and 9% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and 3 points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47% and 40% in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier.  Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision as well as higher employee and supplier payments. Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7% and free cash flow declined 16%.  This quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million, lower than anticipated, driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals.  First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 3 points, COGS growth by 1 point and operating expense growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 4 points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes; 3 points in Intelligent Cloud; and 2 points in More Personal Computing. In our Consumer business, Windows OEM and devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels. And LinkedIn and Search will be impacted as ad market spending remains a bit cautious.  In our Commercial business, we expect business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3. While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution, given our strong position in global growth markets. In commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and the strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued commitments to our platform will be offset by impact from the slowdown of new business noted earlier and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year.  Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point, driven by Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Our data center investments continue to be based on a near-term and longer-term customer demand, including AI opportunities.  Next, segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or USD 16.9 billion to USD 17.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 1 point on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with continued strong engagement on the platform, although impacted by the advertising trends noted earlier and the slowdown in hiring, particularly in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure.  And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365, which is now over 80% of total Dynamics revenue. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 19% in constant currency or USD 21.7 billion to USD 22 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.  In Azure, our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid-30s in constant currency. And from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly 4 to 5 points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about 1 point more than at the segment level. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services.  In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of USD 11.9 billion to USD 12.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline in the mid- to high 30s, in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels. In devices, revenues should decline in the mid-40s as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services on a strong prior year comparable, revenue should be relatively flat as customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions will be partially offset by the slowdown in new business noted earlier.  Search and news advertising ex TAC should grow high single digits, roughly 7 points faster than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and the inclusion of Xandr.  And in gaming. On a prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low single digits as growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be more than offset by lower monetization per hour and third-party and first-party content.  Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 1% and 2% in constant currency or to be between USD 15.65 billion and USD 15.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 11% and 12% at constant currency or be USD 14.7 billion to USD 14.8 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $200 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains and losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder, for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision.  Now some thoughts on H2 and the full year. First, in our Commercial business, revenue grew 20% on a constant currency basis in H1. However, we now expect to see a deceleration in H2, given how we exited December. Next, higher energy costs for the full year are now expected to be $500 million compared to our previous estimate of $800 million. Third, as we continue to prioritize our investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, our Q4 operating expense growth should be in the low single digits in constant currency.  Finally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning cost and growth, investing in our customer success and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs.  In the first half of the year, over 70% of our revenue came from our Commercial business and over 70% of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation and durable growth markets where we are gaining share. I'm confident in the ability of our Microsoft team to manage the near term by continuing to position ourselves for the future. With that, let's go to Q&A. Brett? Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Joe, can you please repeat your instructions? [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. I was hoping we could delve into the expansion of the investment into OpenAI. Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us about is there any expansion in the scope of what you guys are already doing with OpenAI and the commitment that you guys are making in terms of sort of the compute capacity you're going to be giving to them?  And then maybe as from an investor's perspective, how should we think about when this functionality is going to become -- expand beyond just sort of the Azure OpenAI services, and when we're going to start to see some of the positive impacts to perhaps Bing or the productivity suite or more broadly across the solution portfolio? Thank you so much, Keith, for the question. So as you know, we started the OpenAI partnership now in 3 years, 3.5 years ago. And we've been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last 3 years. And so I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI and be strong.  We also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack and also create new solutions and new opportunities. So whenever we think about platform opportunities and platform shift opportunities, that's how we come at it, how can we essentially ride the wave for everything that we have today and make it more expansive and then what new can be created? So if you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute storage and network come together. That's, in some sense, under the radar, if you will. For the last 3.5, 4 years, we've been working very, very hard to build both the training supercomputers and now, of course, the inference infrastructure because once you use AI inside of your applications, it goes from just being training-heavy to inference.  So that's sort of, I think, core Azure itself is being transformed for the core infrastructure business, it's being transformed. And so you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services even, think about what Synapse plus OpenAI APIs can do. We already have Power Platform incorporated capability. You could prompt the -- I mean one of the reasons why we are the leaders in robotic process automation and workflow automation today is because of some of the AI capabilities that we have in there.  GitHub Copilot is, in fact, you would say, the most at-scale LLM-based product out there in the marketplace today. And so we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it's in productivity, whether it's in our consumer services. And so we're excited about it. But I think that we're also excited about OpenAI's own innovation, right? So they commercialize their products. We're excited about the ChatGPT being built on Azure and having the traction it has.  So we look to both, there's an investment part to it and there's a commercial partnership. But fundamentally, it's going to be something that's going to drive, I think, innovation and competitive differentiation in every one of the Microsoft solutions by leading in AI. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Satya, can you give us your overall macro view? There were some comments you had made that concerned, I think, many about the state of the U.S. spending environment. I'm just curious if you could comment and follow up on what you're seeing there just from a spend environment throughout the year. I think many came away with that seeming that you were saying it's getting worse, not better. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Thank you, Brent. First of all, I was making a comment which is sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean there is only -- I always sort of subscribe to that there's only 1 law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world. And then how many times that do we grow? Because as I said even in my comments, Brent, I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher and on a secular basis. So the question is how many times is it, given the overall inflation-adjusted economic growth. So that's kind of how I look at it. Given that, I think the 2 things that we see, which we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it's even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic. They are making sure that they're getting most value out of it or optimizing it.  And then also being a bit more cautious on given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market. So given those 2 things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they'll plow into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. And so one of the key things we are watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this space through our value propositions and even build loyalty with our customers so that long term, we are well positioned for share gains. So that's sort of fundamentally how we view it.  And then the other aspect I'd also say is simultaneously investing in this new AI trend because I don't think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They're all going to have considerations around how is my AI inference performance, cost, model is going to look like? And that's where we are well positioned again. So that's how I view it.  The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what's happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads and that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis, as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. I'd like to follow up a little bit on this question relating to optimization. I know we saw some slowing this quarter. You're guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is -- do you believe at this point is truly people optimizing what they've already bought and stepping that before that versus how much of that is due to macro factors themselves specifically impacting demand? I'd say 2 things, and then, Amy, please feel free to add. One is, it absolutely is -- starts with workloads that they have at scale just because of the visibility one has on what's driving essentially the consumption meters. And there's real guidance that we ourselves emit in the product to say, here are the things that you do to optimize your billing. And so that's sort of what is the fundamental thing. When we say do more with less and how can we help, that's sort of the first place customers go to. And then the next piece, really, I think, is going to be about how they take the optimization that they get and the savings they get in 1 workload and what new project starts. And that's where I think there's a reprioritization. When should we start the new projects? Those are the 2 things that are happening simultaneously. They don't perfectly match, but one of the things is they're looking to back some savings on some workloads and then start. So that's where I think a little bit of what has to happen is the cycle time where the optimization cycle finishes, the projects start and then the projects ramp.  And I think that, that's what, at least on the cloud consumption side, you're seeing. And on the per user side, it's slightly different, which is in per user also, there was real acceleration when it comes to purchases of per user licenses, whether it is for knowledge workers or frontline workers. And again, they're all now making sure that they're all getting used and the usage is going up.  Like when we look at our Office 365 usage, all those numbers are pretty up year-over-year in a substantial way. Like I gave you some of the Teams numbers. In fact, one of the things was, what will happen to Teams usage after the pandemic. Guess what? They're up. And so those are -- that's good news. And now once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added and premium, like I'm very, very excited about Teams Pro coming out in a couple of weeks. And those are all the things that people will be able to sort of use to ensure that the ARPUs are also going up a bit in value. And Mark, because I do think it's actually quite hard to separate from a driver perspective how much is optimization versus macro. It's all related when you start to say what's the best ROI I can get on every budget dollar I spend, and our job as a partner to so many of these customers is to help them do that. So Satya has talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product, where the cycle is going to be a little longer, right, and you're going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5. You can see the ARPU growth, and you can see the consistency potentially in both renewal rate and in, frankly, the Microsoft 365 performance. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Satya, I'm curious if you could talk about how long the cycle time for optimization lasts. Are we talking a couple of quarters, few quarters or multiple years? Because I do take your comment about tech spending as a percentage of global GDP going higher. So if that were to happen, this -- how do you frame the duration of this optimization that's happening in the industry? I mean I think that you can -- you have a workload, you optimize the workload and you start a new workload. So the thing that I would say is when you're done with optimizing a workload is when you are done with the cycle. So I think if you sort of say, when did we enter this -- we accelerated a bunch of workloads during the pandemic over a period of 2 years. So we are optimizing. I don't think we're going to take 2 years to optimize, but we're going to take this year to optimize. And then as we optimize the new projects start and the new project starts don't start instantly at their peak usage, they start and then they scale. And so those are the 2 cycles that will happen where there will be a time block. Got it. So it's a temporary adjustment before we start to get the full effect of the next set of workloads. Good to get that. That's correct. That's correct. The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. This one for Amy. Amy, given the obviously tough environment, it sounds like reaching that full fiscal year 20% constant currency Commercial revs guide would be tough. Is that also true for the soft guidance for 10%-plus total revenue growth for the year? And if I could just sneak in a clarification, Amy, just because it's an important metric. When you talk about a 4- to 5-point decel in Azure, that's off of the 38% reported for December, right, not off the 35% exit rate? It's all -- Karl, let me just -- the first half of your question, give me a second. On the second half of your question, which is the guide off the exit rate, it's off the exit rate on Azure of 4 to 5 points, just to make sure that is clear. In terms of thinking about total year revenue, right, I did not comment on full year revenue as we continue, I think, really just to watch the Windows PC market as it returns to pre-pandemic levels.  Outside of that, as you can see, the trends are relatively consistent. So in some points, it's important because when you look at the operating income margin guidance that I talked about, the fact that we are guiding to really only 1 point of margin deceleration for the year on a constant currency basis with probably over $2 billion of headwind from the OEM business from what we had anticipated heading into the year, the focus on margins, the focus on prioritization, the focus on putting our investments into where we know they have high return, I actually feel quite good about the place that puts us in, as we exit the year in terms of -- and the right energy, right, or leaving the year in Q4 on leverage. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Amy, I wanted to ask about the expense actions that you announced last week. Obviously, not a decision that you would take lightly. How are you thinking about headcount for the remainder of the year and the possibility for further expense actions, if necessary? And what criteria do you consider in making these decisions? Brad, listen, thanks for that question. Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low single-digit operating expense growth, we start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year. And we lapped the acquisitions both of Nuance and of Xandr. So by the time that we get to the end of Q4, you'll see very moderated headcount growth on a year-over-year basis in addition to some of the prioritization decisions we've made.  And you're right. We take decisions, like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue, just incredibly seriously because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that. And so I do think that we feel confident in that exit rate. As I said, it will certainly imply that year-over-year growth, as we lap some of the investments that we've made, will be quite small. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. On Office 365 Commercial, with you guys approaching 400 million seats and the E5 business really starting to accelerate here on that consolidated sort of expense ROI that you're putting forth, should we think about the growth there more evenly balanced between seats and ARPU going forward or still to continue to favor seats? Yes. That's a good question, especially because this quarter, you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question and I'll just reinforce it, as we see some of this moderating seat growth, whether that's some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the stand-alone stuff, you're starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. So it does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number. So we're seeing still good seat growth, still growth across all workloads.  And as you're pointing out, we're getting further into the E5 health, where we've seen, I want to say, 4 or 5 really good quarters of E5 adoption. The value there is just very high for customers in this environment between analytics, security, and I think we've given some, I think, good security data points in terms of adoption and voice. This is a place where customers can save money by moving to this suite. And I do think you're starting to see some of that ARPU help. And we're also investing in outside of Microsoft 365 in other per user workloads. Viva being a new suite, Power Platform on its own and even stand-alone offers like even Teams Pro and what have you. So there's a significant amount of work we want to do besides sort of the suites that we all sort of have at scale. Joe, we have time for 1 last question. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. I wanted to ask just about how your visibility has changed in terms of some of the larger Azure customer ramps. Could you just comment on, to the extent those large customer ramps or if any of those projects are getting put on pause? And then is there any way to just kind of quantify the AI potential contribution or maybe GPU-powered contribution that Azure that you're expecting over the coming quarters? On the second piece, I think it's too early to sort of start somehow separating out AI from the rest of the workload. I mean even the workloads themselves, AI is just going to be a core part of a workload in Azure versus just AI alone. So in other words, if you have an application that's using a bunch of inference, let's say, it's also going to have a bunch of storage, and it's going to have a bunch of other compute beyond GPU inferencing, if you will. So I think over time, obviously, I think every app is going to be an AI app. That's, I think, the best way to think about this transformation. On your characterization of the large customers, whether there is any changes in their trajectory, I would say I'd point back to, I think, some of the commentary around every large customer is looking to optimize the workloads that they have at scale today and plow some of that money back that they save into new project structure. So that's sort of what the classic pattern of large customers is.  Sometimes you have ISVs who are different, right? So if an ISV is optimizing, they optimize and say, what is the new set of features to add at what ramp. All that said, as Amy noted in her remarks, last quarter we added more long-term customer commitments to Azure, and it's great to see that continue. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

         "Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 Caterpillar Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Fiedler. Thank you. Please go ahead. Thank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Caterpillar's Fourth Quarter of 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Ryan Fiedler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Jim Umpleby, Chairman and CEO; Andrew Bonfield, Chief Financial Officer; Kyle Epley, Senior Vice President of the Global Finance Services Division; and Rob Rengel, Senior IR Manager.   During our call, which will extend to 8:40 a.m. Central, we'll be discussing the fourth quarter and full year earnings release we issued earlier today. You can find our slides, the news release and a webcast recap at investors.caterpillar.com under Events and Presentations. The content of this call is protected by U.S. and international copyright law. Any rebroadcast, retransmission, reproduction or distribution of all or part of this content without Caterpillar's prior written permission is prohibited.   Moving to Slide 2. During our call today, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We'll also make assumptions that could cause our actual results to be different than the information we're sharing with you on this call. Please refer to our recent SEC filings and the forward-looking statements reminder in the news release for details on factors that individually or in aggregate could cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecast. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.   On today's call, we'll also refer to non-GAAP numbers. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP numbers to the appropriate U.S. GAAP numbers, please see the appendix of the earnings call slides. Today, we reported profit per share of $2.79 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $3.91 of profit per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We're including adjusted profit per share in addition to our U.S. GAAP results. Our adjusted profit per share was $3.86 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with adjusted profit per share of $2.69 for the fourth quarter of 2021.   Adjusted profit per share for both quarters excluded mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other post-employment benefit plans as well as restructuring items. Adjusted profit per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 also excluded a goodwill impairment.   Now let's turn to Slide 3 and turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jim Umpleby. Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we close out 2022, I'd like to start by recognizing our global team for another strong quarter. Our results reflect healthy demand across most end markets for our products and services. We remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to invest for long-term profitable growth.   In today's call, I'll begin with my perspectives on our performance in the quarter and for the full year. I'll then provide some insights on our end markets. Lastly, I'll provide an update on our sustainability journey.   Overall, it was another strong quarter as demand remained healthy for our products and services. Sales rose by 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, better than we expected. Supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments, particularly in Construction Industries and supported an increase in dealer inventories. We achieved double-digit top line increases in each of our 3 primary segments and saw sales growth in North America, Latin America and EAME, while Asia Pacific was about flat.   Adjusted operating profit margins increased to 17% in the fourth quarter, an all-time record, as we saw our margins improve both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted profit per share was $3.86, which includes an unfavorable $0.41 per share of foreign currency headwind largely due to ME&T balance sheet translation. This was caused by the rapid decline in the U.S. dollar late in the year and reversed much of the favorable impact we saw in the first 3 quarters of 2022. We generated a 17% increase in total sales to $59.4 billion in the year. Services also increased by 17% to $22 billion.   Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was 15.4%, a 170 basis point increase over the prior year. Although we did not achieve our Investor Day margin targets for the year, which I'll discuss more in a moment, I'm pleased that we increased adjusted operating profit by over $2 billion and grew absolute OPEB dollars, which is our internal measure of profitable growth. For the year, we achieved adjusted profit per share of $13.84, also an all-time record. In addition, we generated $5.8 billion of ME&T free cash flow, firmly in our target range. Finally, despite the strong sales in the fourth quarter, backlog grew by $400 million in the quarter to end the year at $30.4 billion, a 32% year-over-year increase.   As I've mentioned, we did see some improvement in certain areas of the supply chain in the fourth quarter, however, pockets of challenge continue, particularly with some suppliers related to Energy & Transportation and Resource Industries. Similar to previous quarters, our sales would have been higher, if not for these supply chain issues.   Our global team delivered one of the best years in our nearly 100-year history, including record full year adjusted profit per share. Despite the supply chain challenges, our team achieved double-digit top line growth and generated strong ME&T free cash flow. We remain committed to serving our customers, executing our strategy and investing for long-term profitable growth.   Turning to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2022, sales increased 20% versus last year to $16.6 billion. The increase was due to favorable price realization and volume growth, which included dealer inventory increases and growth in sales of equipment to end users. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2021, sales to users increased 8%, broadly in line with our expectations.   For machines, including Construction Industries and Resource Industries, sales to users rose by 4%, while Energy & Transportation was up 19%. Sales to users in Construction Industries were up 1%, in line with expectations. As a reminder, nonresidential represents approximately 75% of Caterpillar sales in Construction Industries.   North American sales to users increased as demand remained healthy for both nonresidential and residential despite some moderation in residential. Latin America saw higher sales to users, while EAME and Asia Pacific declined slightly in the quarter. However, excluding China, sales to users in the Asia Pacific region increased.   In Resource Industries, sales to users increased 13%, which was lower than anticipated mainly due to timing issues related to outbound logistics and commissioning. The segment sales to users increased primarily due to heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.   In Energy & Transportation, sales to users increased by 19%, slightly above our expectations. In the fourth quarter, oil and gas sales to users benefited from continued strength in large engine repowers. We also saw strong turbine and turbine-related services. Power generation and industrial sales to users continue to remain positive due to favorable market conditions. Transportation declined from a relatively low base, primarily due to lower locomotive deliveries while marine was up slightly.   Dealer inventory increased by about $700 million in the fourth quarter, which was above our expectations compared to a decrease of about $100 million in the same quarter last year. As I mentioned, supply chain improvements enabled stronger-than-expected shipments, particularly in Construction Industries, and supported an increase in dealer inventories. We saw increases in each of our primary segments. And within Construction Industries, dealer inventories are now in their typical historical range of 3 to 4 months of projected sales. In Construction Industries, the largest dealer inventory increase came in North America, which benefited our most constrained region. Over 70% of the combined year-end dealer inventory in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation is supported by customer orders.   As expected, we generated improved adjusted operating profit margin in the quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. Our adjusted operating profit margin increased by 560 basis points versus last year to 17%, which does not include the noncash goodwill impairment charges and restructuring costs associated with the rail division. I'll provide more detail in rail later in my remarks.   Turning to Slide 5. I'll now provide full year highlights. In 2022, we generated sales of $59.4 billion up 17% versus last year. This was due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventory, increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users. As I mentioned, we generated $22 billion of services revenues in 2022, a 17% increase over 2021. Services growth in 2022 benefited from our ongoing initiatives and investments as well as price realization. We now have over 1.4 billion -- 1.4 million connected assets, up from 1.2 million in 2021. We delivered over 60% of our new equipment with a customer value agreement and the launch of our new app, called Cat Central, helped drive growth in e-commerce sales to users. We also had the highest level of parts availability in our history.   Overall, our confidence continues to increase that we'll achieve our $28 billion services target in 2026. Our full year adjusted operating profit margin was 15.4%, a 170 basis point increase over 2021. Although we significantly increased margins in the fourth quarter versus last year, overall, they did not improve enough for us to achieve our full year Investor Day and margin targets. Our margins in 2022 were impacted by supply chain inefficiencies, ongoing inflationary pressures within manufacturing costs and our conscious decision to continue to invest for profitable growth.   As I mentioned during our last earnings call, our margin targets are progressive, which means we expect to achieve higher operating profit margins as sales increase. In an inflationary environment -- in a higher inflationary environment, where a relatively larger portion of the sales increase is due to price realization, there's less operating leverage, which makes the delivery of those progressive margins more challenging. Andrew will provide more information about our operating profit margin targets.   Moving to Slide 6. We generated ME&T free cash flow of $5.8 billion for the full year, which was in line with our Investor Day range of $4 billion to $8 billion. We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders or 115% of ME&T free cash flow, which included $4.2 billion in repurchased stock and $2.4 billion in dividends to shareholders. We remain proud of our dividend aristocrat status and continue to expect to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. Now on Slide 7, I'll share some high-level assumptions on our expectations moving forward. While we continue to closely monitor global macroeconomic conditions, overall demand remains healthy across our segments, and we expect 2023 to be better than 2022 on both top and bottom line. Just to remind you, our internal measure of profitable growth is absolute OPEB dollars. We believe increasing absolute OPEB dollars will lead to continued higher total shareholder returns over time. We expect to achieve our updated adjusted operating profit margin targets and ME&T free cash flow target range of $4 billion to $8 billion during 2023.   Now I'll discuss our outlook for key end markets this year, starting with Construction Industries. In North America, overall, we see positive momentum in 2023. We expect nonresidential construction in North America to grow due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments, healthy backlogs and rental replenishment. Although residential construction continues to moderate due to tightening financial conditions, it remains at a healthy level.   In Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth in Construction Industries due to public infrastructure spending and supportive commodity prices. As we mentioned during our last earnings call, weakness continues in China in the excavator industry above 10 tons. We expect it to remain below 2022 levels due to low construction activity. In EAME, business activity is expected to be about flat versus last year based on healthy backlogs and strong construction demand in the Middle East, offset by uncertain economic conditions in Europe. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to be flat to slightly down versus the strong 2022 performance.   In Resource Industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds. That said, our customers remained capital disciplined. We anticipate production and utilization levels will remain elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to gain momentum. We expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of parked trucks, which both support future demand for our equipment and services. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing opportunities for profitable growth.   In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth supported by infrastructure and major nonresidential construction projects. In Energy & Transportation, we expect sales growth due to strong order rates in most applications. In oil and gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in demand and order intakes for the year.   New equipment orders for solar turbines continue to be robust. Power generation orders are expected to remain healthy, including data center strength. Industrial remains healthy with momentum continuing for 2023. In rail, North American locomotive sales are expected to remain muted. We anticipate strength in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.   During the fourth quarter, we took in a $925 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our rail division, which is part of the Energy & Transportation segment. The impairment was primarily driven by a revision in our long-term outlook for the company's locomotive offerings. We believe opportunities exist for new locomotives, overhauls, repowers and modernizations but at lower levels than previously forecasted and occurring over a longer time horizon.   In addition to the goodwill impairment charge, we also incurred restructuring cost of $180 million in the quarter, primarily related to noncash inventory adjustments within this division. Importantly, our rail services, including track, signaling and freight car remain robust.   Progress Rail plays an integral part in supporting and maintaining rail infrastructure in countries around the globe, and rail remains one of the most efficient ways of transporting goods across the land. We will continue to offer Tier 4 solutions to our customers, however, strategic investments in new locomotive products will continue shifting to competitive sustainable solutions to help customers meet their carbon reduction initiatives, including hybrid, full battery electric and alternative fuel power sources, including hydrogen. These alternative power solutions for rail will leverage modularity and scale across Resource Industries, Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation. We believe these enterprise-wide investments will provide Caterpillar with a strategic advantage over time.   Moving to Slide 8. We continue to advance our sustainability journey in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we strive to help our customers achieve their climate-related objectives. In November, Caterpillar announced the successful demonstration of its first battery electric 793 large mining truck prototype with support from key mining customers participating in Caterpillar's early learner program. The truck performed at the same specification as a diesel truck on our 7-kilometer course, achieving a top speed of 60 kilometers per hour carrying a full load and 12 kilometers per hour with that same load at a 10% grade. In addition to the truck, we also unveiled plans to create a working and more sustainable mindset of the future at our Arizona-based proving ground. This includes installing and utilizing a variety of renewable energy sources, leveraging technologies from our Electric Power division and new Electrification & Advanced Power Solutions division. We also invested in Lithos Energy, Inc., a lithium-ion battery producer that manufacturers battery packs for the types of demanding environments our Cat equipment thrives in. This collaboration supports our commitment to delivering robust [ enterprise ] products and solutions to our customers.   Lastly, in 2022, we continue to advance our autonomous journey, achieving an industry first of moving over 5 billion tons autonomously across 25 mine tags worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we announced our first autonomous solution in the aggregates industry. We'll collaborate with Luck Stone, the nation's largest family-owned and operated producer of crushed stone, sand and gravel, to expand these solutions beyond mining. We'll utilize Cat MineStar Command for hauling system on 777 trucks, contributing to continued improvements in safety and productivity for our customers these examples reinforce our ongoing sustainability leadership and how we help our customers build a better, more sustainable world. We look forward to issuing our 18th annual sustainability report during the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter results, including the performance of our business segments. Then I'll cover the balance sheet and ME&T free cash flow before concluding on high-level assumptions for 2023, including the first quarter. Beginning on Slide 9. Sales and revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 20% or $2.8 billion to $16.6 billion. The sales increase versus the prior year was due to strong price realization and volume, partially offset by currency impacts. Sales were higher than we expected as supply chain constraints eased in some areas and we were able to ship more product.  Operating profit increased by 4% or $69 million to $1.7 billion. The strong price realization and volume growth were mostly offset by a goodwill impairment charge, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring expenses. Our adjusted operating profit was $2.8 billion, up $1.2 billion versus the prior year, and the adjusted operating profit margin was 17.0%. This was an increase of 560 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to favorable price realization and volume growth, which outpaced manufacturing cost increases. Fourth quarter margins were lower than we were targeting as well as being lower than where we needed them to be to meet our full year Investor Day margin target. I will talk more about that in a moment.   Adjusted profit per share increased by 43% to $3.86 in the fourth quarter compared to $2.69 in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter excluded a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million or $1.71 per share related to our rail division, as Jim has explained. This charge is held at the corporate level and does not impact Energy & Transportation segment margins.   Adjusted profit per share figures also exclude mark-to-market gains for the remeasurement of pension and OPEB plans and restructuring items. Restructuring cost of $209 million or $0.29 in the quarter were primarily related to noncash inventory write-downs within our rail division. Again, these charges impacted the corporate level, and the inventory write-downs are within cost of goods sold in the income statement.   For the full year, restructuring costs were about $600 million. Last quarter, we told you that a noncash charge of approximately $600 million could slip into 2023, which it did. We expect to close on the divestiture of our longwall business in early February, and the noncash charge will be included in our first quarter 2023 restructuring charges.   The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter, excluding the amounts relating to mark-to-market goodwill impairment and other discrete items, reflected a global annual effective tax rate of approximately 23%, as we expected. Finally, our fourth quarter results include an unfavorable noncash foreign currency impact within other income expense of $0.41 related to ME&T balance sheet translation in the quarter.   To explain, many of our foreign entities are U.S. dollar functional. These entities are generally in a net liability position causing a favorable translation impact in periods of U.S. dollar strength. Within each of the first 3 quarters of the year, we saw some benefit as the dollar sequentially trended stronger. However, within the fourth quarter, this trend reversed. Given the significant weakening of the U.S. dollar within the fourth quarter of 2022, the negative impact to profit was sizable. As you would imagine, our forward-looking assumptions do not include expectations for currency fluctuations.   To give a bit more context, other income and expense, excluding the impact of pension mark-to-market adjustments, has trended at around $250 million of income per quarter for all of 2021 and for the first 3 quarters of 2022. This has reflected a number of offsetting items, including currency. In the fourth quarter, excluding pension mark-to-market, other income and expense swung to a $70 million expense. The majority of that change is due to the foreign exchange translation adjustment, which is why we have highlighted this.   Overall, sales were better than we had expected as we had anticipated margins increase, but as I said earlier, not by enough to meet our Investor Day margin targets. Adjusted profit per share rose by 43%, but that was moderated by the $0.41 noncash foreign currency balance sheet translation charge that I mentioned a moment ago. Moving on to Slide 10. The 20% increase in the top line was driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Volume was supported by the $800 million year-over-year impact to changes in dealer inventory and an 8% increase in sales to users. From a sales perspective, currency remained a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. As I mentioned earlier, sales were higher than we expected in the quarter, mostly due to some improvements in the supply chain, which enables stronger shipments, particularly in Construction Industries. The increase in dealer inventories reflects the improved shipments in Construction Industries and customer delivery timing in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. Overall, market dynamics remain healthy as sales to users continue to increase, and our backlog is strong at $30.4 billion.   Moving to Slide 11. Fourth quarter operating profit increased by 4%, impacted by the goodwill impairment charge and restructuring expenses. Adjusted operating profit increased by 78% as favorable price realization and higher sales volume continued to outpace higher manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs increased primarily due to higher material costs and unfavorable cost absorption as we decreased our inventories in the fourth quarter compared to an increase in the prior year.   Related to our recent price cost performance, keep in mind that we are still catching up from the increases in manufacturing costs, which have occurred over the last few years. In particular, material freight costs have increased by about 20% since 2020 and our full year gross margins remain below our 2019 levels. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of 17% was a 560 basis point increase versus the prior year. As Jim has mentioned, this is our highest ever quarterly adjusted operating margin.   As I said earlier, we did not achieve our Investor Day margin targets. As Jim said, in a high inflation environment, you do not get the benefit of operating leverage that you would normally see -- expect when sales increases are volume-driven. You will recall that our margin targets are progressive, which means at the top end of the range, for every $1 billion in sales, incremental revenues, we need to deliver close to 40 percentage points of that through adjusted operating profit. This is challenging to achieve in a high inflation environment when sales increasing due to price realization designed to mitigate increases in manufacturing costs. Also, please keep in mind that we made a conscious decision to continue to invest for future profitable growth.   We have not seen inflation anywhere near double-digit levels since the targets were introduced in 2017. In a low inflation environment, productivity improvements can be made to offset inflationary increases so nominal targets remain effective. In the current high inflation environment, you cannot achieve the level of productivity, so we are adjusting the target sales range to reflect the inflationary increases we've seen in 2022.   On Slide 12, we've updated our margin target slope to account for the impact of inflation as depicted on the chart. We still have the same aspirations for margins, however, the corresponding level of sales and costs are generally around 9% higher than they have been in a noninflationary environment. As you can see, the low end of the sales range is now $42 billion while the top end is $72 billion. This compares to the previous bookends of $39 billion and $66 billion, respectively.   The key point is that despite the inflationary impact on sales and costs which impact margins, our expectations for profit and cash generation have not changed, and we remain focused on delivering increases in absolute OPEB dollars. Depending on the inflationary environment that we see in 2023, we'll have to revisit the range next January.   Moving to Slide 13. Across our 3 primary segments, sales and margins improved in the fourth quarter versus the prior year supported by price realization and sales volume. As expected, price more than offset manufacturing costs in all 3 segments.   Starting with Construction Industries. Sales increased by 19% in the fourth quarter to $6.8 billion, driven by favorable price realization and sales volume, partially offset by currency. Volume increased primarily due to changes in dealer inventory and higher sales to users. Dealer inventory increased in the quarter compared to a reduction last year. Sales in North America rose by 34% due mostly to strong pricing. The positive change is due to inventory and higher sales to users. Sales in Latin America increased by 39% on strong price realization and higher sales volume, the latter due mostly to a favorable change in dealer inventory. In the EAME, sales increased by 10% on price realization and sales volume, partially offset by the unfavorable currency. Sales volume was supported by a positive year-over-year change in dealer inventory as the decrease in the prior year's quarter was larger than this year's decline. Sales in Asia Pacific decreased by 10%, mostly due to unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by stronger price realization. Lower sales volume also contributed to the decline as dealers decreased inventory during the fourth quarter compared to an increase in the prior year. Fourth quarter profit for Construction Industries increased by 87% versus the prior year to $1.5 billion. Price realization and higher sales volume drove the increase. Unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected higher material costs, unfavorable cost absorption and increased freight. The segment's operating margin of 21.7% was an increase of 780 basis points versus last year. The margin for the quarter was better than we had expected on strong volume, price and moderating material costs. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is usually the weakest quarter for margins in Construction Industries, but with the benefit of price realization, the reverse was true in 2022.   Turning to Slide 14. Resource Industries sales grew by 26% in the fourth quarter to $3.4 billion. The improvement was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. Volume increased due to the impact of changes in dealer inventories and higher sales of equipment to end users. Dealer inventory increased more during the fourth quarter '22 than the prior year due to the timing of customer deliveries, which includes the impact of outbound logistics delays and commissioning. Fourth quarter profit for Resource Industries increased by 110% versus the prior year to $605 million, mainly due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily material, freight and volume-related manufacturing costs. The segment's operating margin of 17.6% was an increase of 700 basis points versus last year, strengthening versus the third quarter as we had expected.   Now on Slide 15. Energy & Transportation sales increased by 19% in the fourth quarter to $6.8 billion with sales up across all applications. Oil and gas sales increased by 38% due to higher sales of turbines and turbine-related services, reciprocating engines and aftermarket parts. Power generation sales increased by 12% as sales were higher in large reciprocating engines, supporting data center applications. Sales increased in small reciprocating engines, turbines and turbine-related services as well. Industrial sales rose by 19% with strength across all regions. Finally, transportation sales increased by 6%, benefited from marine applications and reciprocating engine aftermarket parts. Rail services were offset by lower deliveries of locomotives.   Fourth quarter profit for Energy & Transportation increased by 72% versus the prior year to $1.2 billion. The improvement was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Higher manufacturing and SG&A and R&D costs acted as partial offset. Manufacturing cost increases largely reflected higher material costs and volume-related manufacturing costs. SG&A and R&D expenses increased due to investments aligned with our strategic initiatives, including electrification and services growth. The segment's operating margin of 17.3% was an increase of 530 basis points versus last year, strengthening versus the third quarter as we had expected.   Moving to Slide 16. Financial Products revenue increased by 10% to $853 million, benefited by higher average financing rates across all regions. Segment profit decreased by 24% to $189 million. The profit decrease was mainly due to a higher provision for credit losses at Cat Financial and an unfavorable impact from equity securities in insurance services. The increase in provisions reflects changes in general economic factors rather than company-specific economic factors. Despite these changes, our leading indicators remain strong. Past dues were 1.89% compared with 1.95% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. Also, this was an 11 basis point decrease in past dues compared to the third quarter of 2022.   Retail new business volume declined versus the prior year but remained steady compared to the third quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, Cat Financial is not seeing slowing business activity but continues to see strong competition from banks due to higher interest rates and more customers willing to pay cash for their machines. Used equipment demand remains strong with inventories at historically low levels. We continue to see high conversion rates as well as customers choose to buy at the end of the lease term.   Now on Slide 17. ME&T free cash flow in the quarter increased by about $1.2 billion versus the prior year to $3 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher profit. On working capital, our inventory decreased by about $600 million in the quarter. Improved availability of some components benefited shipments as we decreased our work in process inventory. We also saw strong shipments of solar turbines in the quarter.   We repurchased about $900 million of common stock in the quarter and paid around $600 million in dividends. As Jim mentioned, we generated $5.8 billion in ME&T free cash flow for the year, inclusive of CapEx of about $1.3 billion. We are pleased with the strong free cash flow we generated in a year where we paid $1.3 billion in short-term incentive compensation and increased our inventories by over $2 billion. Our liquidity remains strong with an enterprise cash balance of $7 billion and another $1.5 billion in slightly longer-dated liquid marketable securities, which generate improved yields on that cash. Now on Slide 18. I'll share some high-level assumptions for the full year, followed by the first quarter. As we begin 2023, demand remains constructive, given the strong order backlog and improving supply chain dynamics, although we do not expect the benefit of a dealer inventory tailwind like we saw last year. As a reminder, dealer inventory rose by $2.4 billion in 2022. Around 40% of the increase relates to Construction Industries with the balance reflecting the timing of deliveries to customers in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation. As Jim mentioned, over 70% of the combined year-end dealer inventory in Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation is supported by customer orders.   For the full year 2023, we anticipate increased sales supported by price realization. Although we expect stronger sales to users in 2023, the headwind from the $2.4 billion dealer inventory build in 2022 will moderate volume growth. Our planning assumption is that we do not expect a significant change in dealer inventory by the end of the year. We do expect service sales momentum to continue after reaching $22 billion in 2022. From a sales seasonality perspective, we expect a more typical year with lighter first quarter for total sales.   For the full year, we expect our adjusted operating profit to increase, reflecting higher sales, and we expect to be within our updated adjusted operating margin ranges. Pricing actions from 2022 will continue to roll into 2023, and we will evaluate future actions as appropriate to offset inflationary pressures. We currently expect to see a moderation of input cost inflation as the year progresses, and therefore, a corresponding moderation and price realization as we move through the year. Price though should still more than offset manufacturing costs for the year.   Increases in SG&A and R&D expenses are expected to exceed the benefit of lower short-term incentive compensation expense this year as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives such as services growth and technology, including digital, electrification and autonomy. Below operating profit, we anticipate a headwind of approximately just over $800 million or about $80 million per quarter in other income and expense at the corporate level related to pension expense due to higher interest costs given higher interest rates. This is a non-cash item. For the full year of 2022, the strengthening U.S. dollar acted as a tailwind of $189 million relating to the ME&T balance sheet translation impact that I spoke about earlier. This would not recur if the weakening we're seeing in rates thus far continues. Based on current rates, we'd see a headwind of around about $18 million in the first quarter. Remember that 2022 was not a typical year for us as margins increased sequentially throughout -- through the year as the benefit of price realization was stronger in the second half of the year. Also, manufacturing volumes were impacted by supply chain issues, which did impact absorption rates from quarter to quarter. These factors will mean that we do not expect to return to our normal seasonal margin patterns in 2023. Moving on, we expect to achieve our ME&T free cash flow target of $4 billion to $8 billion for the year, with CapEx in the range of about $1.5 billion. We'll have about $1.4 billion cash outflow in the first quarter related to the payout of last year's incentive compensation, slightly higher than we saw in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipate restructuring expenses of around $700 million this year, the majority of which is related to the longwall divestiture charge that I mentioned earlier. Finally, we anticipate a global effective tax rate of 23%, excluding discrete items. Now on to our assumptions for the first quarter. In the first quarter compared to the prior year, we expect sales to increase on price and slightly stronger volume, reflecting higher sales to users. With regard to seasonal inventory, we expect a typical seasonal build in the first quarter of this year. As a reminder, dealers increased inventories by $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022, and we expect a lower build in the first quarter of 2023. Sales should increase across the 3 primary segments in the first quarter versus the prior year. Compared to the fourth quarter, we anticipate lower sales in the first quarter at the enterprise level following our typical seasonal pattern. We expect lower sales sequentially in each of our 3 primary segments as well.   To provide some color, Construction Industries is following an abnormally strong fourth quarter, where shipments exceeded our expectations. Resource Industries had a strong fourth quarter with its highest quarterly shipments since 2012 and expect lower sequential sales in the first quarter due to the timing of shipments, which, as you know, can be lumpy. Energy & Transportation sales should be sequentially lower as well following normal seasonable patterns. Keep in mind that solar turbines had a strong fourth quarter.   Specific to the first quarter versus the prior year, keep in mind that the first quarter margins last year were very low. We expect substantially strong enterprise and segment margins in the first quarter on favorable price and volume. Price realization should more than offset manufacturing costs at both the [ enterprise and primary segment ] levels as well. Also, we could see headwinds related to pension and currency below operating profit, as I just mentioned.   Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be flattish to down for the first quarter of the year at the enterprise level. Keep in mind that our fourth quarter of '22 adjusted operating profit margins were our highest quarterly margins ever. By segment, in Construction Industries, we normally see higher margins in the fourth quarter -- first quarter. However, coming off a very strong fourth quarter, we expect lower volume to weigh on margins sequentially. This is the business which usually drives the enterprise-wide sequential margin improvement from the fourth quarter to the first. Similarly, lower volumes should drive sequentially lower margins in Resource Industries. And in Energy & Transportation, we expect lower margins sequentially following a strong fourth quarter, which is the normal pattern for this business.   Turning to Slide 19, let me summarize. Sales grew by 20%, led by strong price realization and volume gains across the 3 primary segments. The adjusted operating profit margin increased by 560 basis points to 17%. ME&T free cash flow was strong at $3 billion for the quarter, and we continue to return cash to shareholders on a consistent basis. Service revenues were $22 billion for the full year, a 17% increase as momentum built in 2022. The outlook remains positive with improving supply chain dynamics and the backlog up around $400 million to over $30 billion. We've updated our margin target scope to account for the impact of inflation on sales and costs, and we expect our 2023 adjusted operating margins to be within our updated range.   Despite the inflationary impact on sales and costs, our expectations for profit and cash flow generation have not changed, and we will continue to execute our strategy for long-term profit growth. I want to confirm that our full year 2022 restructuring costs were about $300 million for the year, so apologies if [indiscernible] in the call. Now with that -- now we'll hand over to questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Just wanted to -- and I appreciate all the color on dealer inventories. I guess -- it looks to me like about $1 billion of the build is in construction. A good chunk of that is in North America. And retail sales here have been, call it, flattish over the past 3 quarters or so. So I guess I'm curious, as you think about Q1 and you think about that seasonal inventory build, where do you expect that to occur? Is the channel stocked enough in North America construction? And how comfortable are you with dealers actually being able to put through this inventory to end users in 2023? We typically see an increase ahead of the spring selling season, so that's why we think it will be a traditional kind of increase. Again, we've talked about what we see happening in the various markets, again, the strength in infrastructure, which is 75% of CI, some moderation in residential in North America, as we discussed. But again, North America has really been our most constrained region. So we're pleased to see healthier dealer inventories in North America. And we're now in that typical range of 3 to 4 months. And again, we talked about the fact that RI and E&T typically don't hold a lot of dealer inventory. Hoping to get an order. Over 70% of the year-end dealer inventory for RI and E&T is tied to customer orders. So again, hope that helps. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. I guess -- I'm going to ask about turbines within E&T. Obviously, the global energy mix is shifting on that gas to Russia and so forth. Are you able to say -- orders have been strong, I assume, related partly to that. Is the solution sort of already in the pipeline for solar? Or are there a lot of projects underway and/or under consideration? Do you expect to keep that segment elevated for the next several years? Well, it's always -- Rob, it's always tough to make a multiyear prediction, but I will say that orders or order rates are quite strong for solar, as is quotation activity. And of course, solar is very involved in that natural gas value chain, compressing a lot of gas to LNG facilities for export around the world. There has been an underinvestment, I'd argue, in oil and gas over the last few years, and that it's starting to be reversed now, and that has a positive impact on both our Cat oil and gas business and our solar business. So again, very difficult always to make a multiyear projection not knowing what's happening in the economy.  But based on what we see today, business is quite strong for solar, both on the services side and on the new equipment side. And one of the things we have seen, there was a -- for a while there, after the decline in oil prices a few years ago, we saw a decline in international projects. That have -- that's picked up for solar. So we're seeing more international projects. We're also seeing strength in North American gas compression for solar as well. Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. I guess my question, can you talk for 2023 where is there opportunity to put through incremental price and where you see deflation? And the question just comes from Jim, just the incremental margins that you put up in the fourth quarter were fairly impressive. So I'm just wondering how big sort of the price cost tailwind can be in 2023 with the strong pricing actions and supply chain easing and potentially deflation in some areas. Well, Jamie, we always -- certainly, when we think about price actions, we take a number of things into account. Certainly, we take into account the increases from our suppliers in cost. We also, of course, pay very close attention to competitive market and always striving to provide more value to our customers. So it's difficult for us to make a prediction as to what will happen. We demonstrated the ability to pass along price when we need to because of inflationary factors. But again, we always keep competition in mind as well. So again, pleased at how we're doing so far and the way we're managing that balance. Yes. And as I think we've said from our planning assumptions perspective, obviously, there was some carryover price impacting us in -- particularly in the first half of the year. As we expect to go through the year, we expect that benefit of price to moderate in the second half, but also we expect the increases in manufacturing costs to continue to moderate as we go through the year. So -- but obviously, that's a planning assumption. And as always the case, that is predicated on the assumption that inflation does moderate. And as Jim said, we'll obviously keep an eye open on that and take pricing actions accordingly. Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Jim, I'm wondering if you just talk about your production plan in Construction Industries and what are you folks looking for in terms of the decision to potentially curtail production if we do continue to see dealer inventory builds ahead of expectations. Just -- if you could just touch on the key indicators that you're looking at and how can we gradually affect the production slowdown if that's indeed what we need to do over the course of '23. Thanks, Jerry. And certainly, again, we obviously pay very close attention to what's happening in the marketplace. We pay attention to STUs. Dealers are independent businesses, they make their own decisions about inventory. But certainly, we do work with them. And the last thing we want to do is to have too much inventory in the channel. As it occurs today, as we mentioned earlier, we're now back in our normal typical range, and still -- we still have many dealers that would like more equipment from us to support customer orders.  So -- and we talked about the fact that nonresi is 75% of construction industries, and it is still quite robust and strong, and we expect it to grow. Yes, some moderation in residential. But again, 75% is nonresi. So again, as we always do, we'll pay close attention to the market, and we'll modify our production plans as appropriate. But there are still some products that we want -- we need to produce more of, quite frankly, and we're still dealing with some supply chain issues in some areas.  So again it's not a one-size-fits-all answer. We talked about the fact that China is slow, and will continue -- we expect it to continue to be slow below 2022 levels. But in many areas, demand is quite -- still quite strong. Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore. My question relates to the first quarter guidance.  Normal seasonality on sales. EBIT margins usually go up a couple of hundred basis points. I mean that's sort of a [ $4.50 ] EPS number. What you're implying is a little closer to [ $4 ]. The margins in particular, you mentioned pension. And I know CI is at a high level so the comp is tough sequentially. But on price cost, what are you assuming on price cost first quarter versus fourth quarter? If you could just give us some color. Just to see the margins flat to down sequentially, even with the tough comp, is a bit unique. And just if you could help us flesh out sort of the price cost. Yes. David, great question and part of the reason why I highlighted that CI margins were actually very, very high in the fourth quarter. Part of that was because normally in the fourth quarter, you don't see a deal inventory build as big as we did see in the fourth quarter. And the fact that, that release did help overall CI margins come in a little bit better than we expected as well. Obviously, what that does mean is normally, yes, correct, we normally get a 200 to 300 basis points bump in the first quarter based on production and ramping up production. Obviously, those production rates aren't quite the same as they would normally be fourth quarter to first quarter because obviously, we're looking at a very different profile, particularly given that, obviously, we were building production through 2022, particularly in CI. So that is the biggest challenge, and that's probably the biggest single factor, which will drive margins sequentially lower.  On price/cost, we still expect strong price in Q1. It will not be as big as Q4 for the simple reason we are lapping price increases that we put through at the beginning of 2022. So that will be coming down slightly, but we do expect price cost to be favorable for the first half of the year. Again, that's just going to create a little bit of noise in the margin structure quarter-on-quarter. Unfortunately, we are not going to go back to the normal lower margins in Q1, higher margins in Q4, which you guys are going to be able to model. It's going to still be a little bit different as we go through 2023. Obviously, 2022 was the opposite. Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. So I'm trying to understand the volume commentary for this year. Since you expect sales to end users to be stronger this year versus last year but you don't expect dealer inventory restocking benefit, does that mean dealer inventory could actually decline again from current levels to support the stronger sales to the end users? No. Our assumption at the moment -- Tami, thanks for the question, is at the moment, so planning assumption, as is always the case, the dealer inventories will be flattish for the year and should not increase or decrease. Effectively, what that does mean, though, is obviously the headwind exists from our shipments on the $2.4 billion of dealer inventory that got built in 2022. Remind you, a big chunk of that, around about 60%, is in E&T and in RI, which is related to customer orders, which will be -- fall through into our sales to end users in due course. But overall, we expect, again, sales to users to be up year-over-year. And that will -- and the dealer inventory headwind will up moderate that level of increase, the volume that we will see in our shipments, as I said in my remarks. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Feniger with Bank of America. Just following up on the solar comment in the oil and gas portfolio. E&T was a dominant driver of earnings 7 to 8 years ago with leading margins for Cat. It's one of the only segments you're not getting that double-digit pricing right now. It's lagged the others. Do you see room for that to pick up following this reversal of underinvestment the last few years? And is there anything structurally keeping Cat from returning to those prior peak margins in E&T? Mike, thanks for the question. So you may recall that we put through price increases later in E&T than we did with machines just based on the market dynamics that existed at the time. So having said that, as I mentioned, particularly in oil and gas and power generation, market is quite strong and we expect our volumes certainly in oil and gas to increase. And we're dealing with kind of oil and gas still some supply chain challenges. And so we're dealing with that. That factor was a ramp-up. Solar is, again, I mentioned earlier, a very strong fourth quarter but still very robust order rates coming in and a lot of quotation activity. So again, we do expect that -- E&T to improve in 2023. And I won't try to compare it to where they were a few years ago. I mean to say that the business is strong and improving. Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to dig into the manufacturing cost side of the price/cost equation. It sounds to me, reading through the comments you made in response to an earlier question, that you still expect manufacturing costs to be a headwind year-on-year in 2023. Can you just kind of talk through the big components of that materials versus freight and why we shouldn't expect at some point in 2023 for manufacturing costs to become a tailwind? Yes. So I mean there's a couple of factors, obviously, that come into that. Material costs will still be a headwind, we expect. Some of that is material cost inflation that we're still seeing through this year. Some of that material cost inflation is not just necessarily commodity costs. Some of it will be labor costs and some of it will include energy costs. So all of those factors, we are anticipating, will moderate as we go through the year. We are starting to see signs of lower levels of request for price increases coming from customers -- from suppliers. So that's a positive sign. And hopefully, as things unwind through the year, some of that will moderate, Again, we have not -- in our planning assumptions, we based our pricing actions on what we're assuming from a manufacturing cost perspective, and obviously, we'll take action as appropriate, if we need to, if there are great increases than we're currently expecting in manufacturing costs in 2023. Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. So in China, I know you mentioned that you're expecting levels to be below '22, at least on the end market perspective. But maybe you could talk about just like what you're seeing in like your -- in the channel from an inventory perspective relative to, I guess, normalized levels. And then how should we think about the business now that you have the GX series for a full China cycle? Yes, again, just to reiterate. We had a couple of really strong years in China in 2020, '21, and we had saw softening in '22. And again, we don't see signs of improvement at this point. We continue to invest in new products to try to maintain our competitiveness with new products. So that's continuing, and we've been pleased with the response to those new products, including the GX. But that above 10-ton excavator market, we do expect to be weaker in 2023 than it was in 2022. And inventory in the fourth quarter versus the build in the prior year is lower. Yes. So we actually had a reduction in dealer inventory in Asia Pac this year in CI versus the build in the previous year. Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citi. Yes. Jim, maybe just a follow-up on the -- just mining outlook within RI. I get the point about the miners being capital disciplined, which has been in place for some time but just on the back of what appears to be strong results and outlooks from a competitor in Asia overnight. Maybe just say a bit more about kind of the outlook and your views on the mining piece of ROI for '23. Yes. Thank you, Tim. We've been talking for a number of years in our earnings call about what we expect in the mining industry, which was moderate growth year-on-year and -- as opposed to what we saw -- going back, thinking about 10 or 12 or 15 years ago, where we saw some wild cycles up and down. And really, I believe that's a function of our mining customers remaining capital disciplined. And that's a very positive thing, I think, for them and for us.  And what we've been saying for a number of years now in our earnings calls that we expect a year-over-year moderate increase, and that's exactly the way it's playing out. So we're very encouraged by our quotation activity with customers, the conversations that are going on. We have a strong backlog, which we feel good about. Parked trucks remain at low levels, there's high utilization of equipment, and customers make decisions on a whole variety of factors as to whether or not they're going to rebuild or they're going to buy new trucks, and we benefit from either one of those things.  We're very encouraged by our autonomous solution, and we firmly believe we have the best solution in the industry, and that's being demonstrated by the decision -- the purchasing decisions that our customers are making. And as a reminder, of course, RI also includes quarry and ag, which the trends there are positive as well. A lot of that is driven by infrastructure spending and anticipated infrastructure spending. So again, we feel good about the mining business. And again, quotation activity is very strong, and we're having very good conversations with customers. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Elkott with Cowen. I was hoping you guys can provide us with some more insight into the strength you're seeing in the Middle East. And related to that, but longer term, Saudi Arabia has big plans in both construction and, more recently, mining. Are there any meaningful incremental opportunities for you guys there? Matt, I believe we mentioned in our prepared remarks that EAME, which is Europe, Africa and the Middle East is expected to be about flat. And we said that strength in the Middle East is offsetting some uncertainty in Europe. So certainly, when oil prices are elevated, that tends to provide the investment capabilities for customers in the Middle East, whether it's for oil and gas business or for construction. So again, we -- it is certainly a bright spot and a positive one, and one that we feel will continue through 2023. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. I'm just curious what was different about the supply chain in construction, which sounds like it was -- it is pretty smooth versus E&T and Resource, which sounded like are still a little challenging. Is it just still the randomness that's out there? And then last quarter, you talked about some of the manufacturing inefficiencies due to supply chain. Just curious how that played out in Q4 and what do you expect for that in '23. Yes. Thanks, Steven. And then, certainly, we have a diverse group of suppliers and a diverse product line, and we did see some improvement in the quarter, but there are still some areas of strength. And just -- and we think -- and it's very different product by product. And even though you'll see a number of suppliers in better shape, all it takes is one component to prevent you from shipping an engine or a machine. And part of it is just the nature of the beast, I think, as to what's happening in various industries. And if we look at our large engines, it's more of a struggle, frankly, than it is with some of our construction machines at the moment. And these things ebb and flow over time, but that's where we are today.  We still see some semiconductor availability challenges. I know on the -- with the higher-end chips, that's improved significantly in the industry based on industry reports. But for the semiconductors that we use, it continues to be a challenge. And so in the fourth quarter, we certainly did still experience inefficiencies associated with supply chain challenges, and that had an impact on us because we're still doing things like workarounds and it's not anywhere as smooth as it needs to be. Yes. And I think if you look out for the rest of the year, what we do expect is that, obviously, we start to lap those in the second half of the year, those inefficiencies. So we should either see a moderation or actually a reversal of some of that supply chain inefficiency we saw in the second half of the year. Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Wanted to follow up on the services growth. You reported now $22 billion, on track to meet that $28 billion target by 2026. Can you just talk to us about some of the growth drivers in that business and maybe provide us with an update on customer value agreement take rates? You bet. So again, we are encouraged, as I mentioned, about our progress in services. And we mentioned when we threw that target out that it wouldn't be a straight line, it wouldn't be linear and we knew we had to make investments to make it happen. And we are continuing to invest in a whole variety of things. We've got more connected assets now, $1.4 million, up from $1.2 million last year. We're investing significantly in our e-commerce capabilities. That's one more arguably -- I'd argue, we were a bit behind, but we made great progress and very proud of what the team is doing there and those sales are increasing. To answer your question on customer value agreements, over 60% of new equipment in 2022 was delivered with the CBA, and that's really important because it creates that customer touch point, and it gives us the ability to demonstrate that value that we can provide.  And also, we're investing heavily in AI. We have what are called prioritized service events. So what that does is it allows us to give dealers a lead on aftermarket service and repair in advance, and it does -- it provides value to our dealers, of course, but it also provides value to our customers because it allows them to avoid unplanned downtime. So that's really positive as well.  And also, we've been working on parts availability. We need to have the right parts at the right place at the right time. And that's one of the benefits of having connected assets and also utilizing AI with those connected assets to ensure that we anticipate where those parts will be needed, and that's a key enabler as well. Operator, we have time for one more question. Your final question today comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. My question is on inventory. The Cat inventory on your balance sheet was up about $2.2 billion or something roughly in '22. And I'm sure some of that was price. But is there an opportunity to sort of draw that back down as supply chains improve? Or are we in sort of a new reality where we need a little bit higher inventory because of the vagaries of all the supply chains and international trade and et cetera? We're not running as lean as I would like us to be. And certainly, that is a consequence of the supply chain challenges we're having. And I think I mentioned in previous calls the term decommitted, one that I hadn't been familiar with until COVID hit and where customers at very short notice decommit and don't give us components when we need them. And so that's created inefficiencies. It's also resulted in more inventory. So I wouldn't say it's a permanent condition. I believe -- as the supply chain situation improves, I do expect us to become leaner again and to be able to reduce our internal inventory.  All right. Well, thank you all for joining us. I really do appreciate your questions. Just to summarize here, I'm very proud of our global team. They delivered one of the best years we had on record. We had strong overall top line growth. Services grew 17%. We generated strong adjusted operating profit and ME&T free cash flow in the year. And we achieved an all-time record for adjusted profit per share. As we think about the year, we're encouraged by the strong quotation activity, our $30 billion backlog, and as we mentioned, we believe 2023 will be an even better year than 2022 on both the top and bottom line. And we continue to remain focused on supporting our customers and executing our strategy for long-term profitable growth. Again, thank you for your questions. Thank you, Jim, and everyone who joined us today. A replay of our call will be available online later this morning. We'll also post a transcript on our Investor Relations website as soon as it's available. You'll also find a fourth quarter results video with our CFO and an SEC filing with our sales to users data. Click on investors.caterpillar.com and then click on Financials to view those materials. If you have any questions, please reach out to Rob or me. The Investor Relations general phone number is (309) 675-4549. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day. And now I'll turn it back to Emma to conclude the call. Thank you so much for attending today's call. You may now disconnect."

         "Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us today. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.   Our presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our fourth quarter earnings news release is posted in the same location and will be joined by the transcript once it's available.   Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from this presentation. That will give analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at about 8:30 a.m. Central Time.   During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, so we encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments is listed in our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Qs. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website.   Also, as a reminder, we posted our Advancing Climate Solutions Report, Sustainability Report and Energy Outlook online in mid-December. We reference them in today's presentation, and you can find them on our website under the Sustainability tab.   Lastly, in the past, we've held an annual Investor Day in March. We won't be hosting an Investor Day in 2023. Last December, we laid out comprehensive plans for 2023 through 2027 as part of our Corporate Plan Update, and the company is already executing on these plans. We've been enjoying the higher level of investor engagement that we've been having. We'll continue to seek your feedback, to host events that give you access to our leaders and insights on parts of the business that interest you and to share with you information about the company and our plans on more of a real-time basis.   With that, I'll hand it over to Darren. Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today.  Before covering our 2022 results, I want to start by recognizing our people. Their hard work and commitment, not only to the company, but to meeting the critical needs of society, are what drove the strong results we reported this morning.  Their work is not easy. Whether it's achieving industry-leading safety, driving record levels of environmental performance, increasing production, offsetting runaway inflation, effectively responding to expropriations or quickly recovering for winter storms, to name just a few of the challenges, our people delivered while, I'll add, continuing to manage significant ongoing organizational changes. As I cover our results, I think you'll see why we and the entire management team are so proud of their efforts.  Of course, our results clearly benefited from a favorable market. To take full advantage of the undersupplied market, our work began years ago, well before the pandemic, and we chose to invest countercyclically. We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom. We continue with these investments through the pandemic and into today.  This year, our improved asset portfolio, organization changes and strong operating performance came together to deliver industry-leading results, industry-leading earnings, cash flows, return on capital employed and total shareholder returns. Excluding asset sales, we had our best cash flow performance since the merger.  And despite lower revenues, we delivered higher profits than 2012, our previous record year, with a 400 basis point improvement in profit margin, reflecting upgrades to our product mix, structural cost reductions, disciplined expense management.   2022 was also a year of strong progress across our 5 strategic priorities. Importantly, we've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian at a time when the world needed it most.   We implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage our scale and integration, improve effectiveness and better serve our customers. We combined our downstream and chemical companies to form Product Solutions, the world's largest fuels, chemicals and lubricants business. This new integrated business is focused on developing high-value products, improving portfolio value and leading in sustainability.  We're also now supporting our businesses with corporate-wide organizations, including projects, technology, engineering, operations, safety and sustainability. We see further opportunities in supply chain, procurement and finance.  We continued to expand our Low Carbon Solutions business, recently signed the first-of-its-kind customer contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This agreement, in a hard-to-decarbonize sector, highlights how ExxonMobil can leverage our advantages to help others reduce their emissions and build an attractive business with strong returns and significant opportunities for growth.   The recent passage of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes both hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, further reinforces this. To that end, in December, we shared our plans to invest approximately $17 billion in lower-emissions opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in our prior plan.   We also made significant progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our existing operations and remain on track with our 2030 emissions-reduction plans, including net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin by 2030.   In addition to investing in industry-advantaged projects, we took advantage of the strong markets to further high-grade our asset portfolio with approximately $5 billion in divestments of noncore assets. CapEx was in line with our guidance.  To further increase transparency, in 2022, we introduced 3 new reports: the Lobbying Report, which provides additional disclosure of our lobbying activities and expenditures; Climate Lobbying Report, which provides details on our U.S. activities at the federal and state level; and our Investing in People supplement, an addition to our updated Sustainability Report.   Lastly, as I mentioned, the hard work of our people underpinned our success this past year, as it has done for decades. We build on this advantage every year by attracting and developing the best talent. This past year, we were once again recognized as top in industry for most attractive employer among U.S. engineering students, an honor we've received 10 years in a row.   Our 2022 financial results, which led the industry, further confirmed the strength of the strategy we developed 5 years ago. We grew earnings to nearly $56 billion, $59 billion excluding identified items, significantly outpacing peers. We delivered an industry-leading total shareholder return of 87% and a return on capital employed of 25%, our highest 1-year ROCE since 2012.   Cash flow from operating activities was nearly $77 billion, also leading the industry. This enabled us to reduce net debt to 5%, fortifying the balance sheet and positioning us to continue our strategy of countercyclically investing.   Our continued focus on leveraging scale and integration drove further efficiencies with nearly $6.9 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019, up from $5.3 billion at the end of 2021. We remain on plan to meet our target of $9 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2023.   Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share our success with shareholders through a reliable and growing dividend. In 2022, we boosted the quarterly dividend by more than 3% and marked the 40th consecutive annual increase. Additionally, we increased our share repurchase program twice during the year. In total, we returned $30 billion to shareholders in 2022, including about $15 billion in dividends, which also led peers.   These actions reflect the confidence we have in our strategy, the performance we've seen across our businesses and the strength of our company's future. We're proud of our people and their work to meet the other needs of society. As we advance our strategy and the \"and\" equation, we're committed to sharing their progress.   Consistent with this, we continue to enhance our disclosures and increase transparency. In December, we updated several important online publications. Our latest Sustainability Report describes the 14 focus areas where we believe our company can have the most impact.  The Advancing Climate Solutions 2023 Progress Report outlines our approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net-zero future. It includes updated resiliency modeling under the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, including the addition of carbon and pricing assumptions, and an audit statement from Wood Mackenzie.   In addition, it includes a discussion on the value of a life-cycle approach to measuring company-specific emissions versus Scope 3 targets. We believe a life-cycle approach for companies is more aligned with the principles of ESG, better reflects a company's efforts to reduce society's emissions and avoids the negative consequences of a company-specific Scope 3 target.   The update also contains more information on how we're driving reductions in methane emissions. And finally, it includes a look at the role of plastics in the energy transition and how we're expanding our capacity for advanced recycling to help address the issue of plastic waste.   Separately, we've updated our Outlook for Energy, which is our latest view of energy supply and demand through 2050. It forms the basis for our business planning. In addition to assessing trends in economic development, technology advances and consumer behavior, our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often targets specific sectors.  We encourage you to read these publications to gain a better understanding of how we're working to be a leader in the energy transition. They're available on our website under the Sustainability tab.  Our plan for 2023 remains anchored in our existing strategy and builds on our continuing success. I'll wrap up by highlighting a few key areas. Critically, we'll continue our efforts to lead the industry in safety, operating and financial performance. We'll continue to profitably grow the business through advantaged investments to meet the world's evolving needs and reduce emissions.   We'll further leverage our new organization to fully realize our advantages in scale and integration and improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver another $2 billion in structural cost reductions, meeting our target of $9 billion in savings versus 2019.   We'll look to capture additional organizational synergies by consolidating our supply chain activities and centralizing a majority of our finance and procurement operations. This will help us take better advantage of our scale and greatly improve our customer, vendor and employee experience.   We anticipate 2023 capital and exploration expenses of $23 billion to $25 billion. This includes investments in the next development in Guyana and increased spending in U.S. unconventional assets. It also includes advancing our China chemical complex and numerous emission-reduction opportunities.   We'll advance our work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity in our operated assets and help customers reduce theirs, focusing on hard-to-decarbonize sectors. We'll continue to progress our blue hydrogen project in Baytown that consists of 1 billion cubic feet per day blue hydrogen plant, the world's largest, and a CCS project with potential to store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year. We'll also leverage our recent success in Louisiana to grow the customer base for our Low Carbon Solutions business.  As energy system evolves, our focus on the fundamentals and investments in the integrated but diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses will play a crucial role in capturing value and outperforming competition, irrespective of the pace or path of the transition.   As you've seen, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities: investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage across the commodity cycles and sharing our success through shareholder distributions.  We've demonstrated our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and further sharing our success through the share repurchase program with up to $35 billion in cumulative repurchases in 2023 and 2024.   2022 demonstrated the importance of the \"and\" equation and the strength of our strategy. We feel good about the progress we've made and even better about the opportunities ahead.   With that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer. Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jennifer, please open up the line for our first question. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jeanine Wai with -- I apologize, we'll go first to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Two, please. First one, your comments, Darren, on runaway inflation. Obviously, the Permian gets a lot of the headlines there. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the offshore environment. ExxonMobil is one of the most active in the space there. So I just want to get a sense of what you're seeing inflation-wise in the offshore.   And then second question is on CapEx, and I probably shouldn't do this, but if I take the 4Q numbers and annualize them, you would be above the 2023 guide. So obviously, I have to adjust for a little bit of seasonality there, but I would have thought you'd be adding growth CapEx 2023 versus '22, plus you have the inflationary pressure that you mentioned. So how much contingency is there in the 2023 CapEx guidance? And what are the risks there to the upside or downside? Yes. Biraj, let me start with your last question and then move to the first. With respect to CapEx, if you look at the range we've given, I think we've indicated in the comments, and I just -- the comments I just made, that we'll be at the upper end of that range, which is consistent with a slight increase given the work that we're doing.  But I would reiterate that the broader range that we've given over the years continues to fit well with our plans and is consistent with the pacing that we established when we came out of the pandemic. As I mentioned before, we had worked with our contractors to lay out a plan for how we continue to progress those investments. And I would tell you today, with our projects organization, feel really good about the progress we're making, the efficiencies that we're gaining with our CapEx.  If you look at the pause that we had to take due to the pandemic, we basically offset any of those costs to maintain the same level of productivity of the spend going forward. So something real proud of the projects organization is doing. So I would expect to continue to stay within that range. And if that changes, obviously, in the years to come, we'll update you as our plans develop and make sure you all stay aware of that.   With respect to the inflation, I would say from an operating expense standpoint, one point I'd make is if you look at what the organization did year-on-year, essentially with all the synergies that we are capturing, some of the scale advantages and purchasing power we had, essentially the businesses collectively came in on plan. We were able to offset the inflation that we're seeing from an expense standpoint, which was obviously no easy task.   I think on the -- if you look at the different projects around the world, it really is a function of when we chose to engage the contractors and engage the equipment that we're using. I mean, if you look at the Permian, it's the short cycle and where there's a lot of activity. And so like a lot of the parts of our business, supply and demand gets tight and puts pressure on pricing. There's less of that supply-demand pressure in other parts of the business, so not seeing the same kind of pressure that we're seeing in the Permian. That tends to be the one area that's really, really hot.   But I think in all those areas, we're using the size of the business that we have and the long-term plans that we have and long-term commitments that we can make with our contracting partners to make sure that we're keeping those in check and that our partners are playing the long game here with us. So I think we've done a pretty good job of keeping productivity pretty high. I feel pretty good about that.  I don't know, Kathy, anything you want to add? Just the other thing I would add is I'd really caution you about taking the fourth quarter CapEx and exploration expense and kind of annualizing it because we tend to run a bit higher in the fourth quarter, and the expense isn't kind of prorated over the year.   Overall, 2022 came in right about where we expected it. And when we talked about our corporate plan in December, we said we expect it to be at about $23 billion to $25 billion in 2023 and that we expect just to see a little bit of an increase year-over-year in part because Payara has been pulled forward, so we have a little more spending there. China 1 is starting to spool up. And obviously, our emission plans are also spooling up. So right now, I'd say we're very consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we've given you. We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Our question is on the downstream, which was a nice positive in 2022. And how do you think the EU embargo on Russian product imports on February 5 will impact your refining margins? And I guess what we're thinking is that there's a number of moving pieces between your refining footprint, particularly in the Gulf Coast and Europe. And then there's potential tailwinds for diesel margins as Russian export dissipate, but there's also -- probably need to take into account the likely incremental tightness in VGO supplies? Yes, I'll take that, Jeanine. I think start with just the market in general, and I think the driver behind the refining margins that we've seen here of late is the -- driven by the pandemic impacts of shutting down capacity and then not having that capacity available as demand has recovered. So the world remains pretty tight and it will stay, I think, tight while we wait for additional refinery expansions to come online primarily out in Asia and the Middle East.   I think the Russia impact in the ban on products going into Europe could potentially have some short-term implications. At the end of the day, those products are going to be needed. So it really is around the logistics, I'll call it, dis-optimization to where the market is pretty efficient. And we've got the most efficient supply chains and logistics systems lined out. We're going to disrupt those.   And I think it is a question of how does that disruption manifest itself in the market and what kind of disconnects and discontinuities do you see in the short term. And then ultimately, we'll -- that system will stabilize, re-optimize. And I expect a higher cost just because of you're moving to a less optimal logistics approach but more stable. I don't -- that I see is how that's going to play out. So I don't think there'll be a long-term impact. It will be a short-term one, and then it's just a question of how long it takes for the systems to rebalance.   I think more fundamental to refining is the shortness and with the economies picking up and with China coming out of its COVID lockdown and the economic growth there and then the view that you take on the economic impacts and how severe recessions are here this year, that's probably going to play a much bigger role. If demand picks up, economies continue to grow, we're going to see that tightness manifest itself in continued high refining margins, which I think will mean a fairly high margins this year and potentially going into 2024 as well. We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. I wanted you to spend some time on the Permian outlook for 2023. You made some comments in the prepared remarks about getting to over 600,000 barrels a day. So I guess that's about 10% growth as we think about '23. But just your thoughts on volumes and then, ultimately, where should we think about plateau? Yes. Thanks, Neil. I would take you back to 2018 when we were talking about our strategy in the Permian. And we had said at that time, our plan was to grow to 1 million barrels a day of production by 2025. When the pandemic hit, we basically said there's going to be a delay in a lot of our plans and pushed out those objectives by about 2 years, so moving from 2025 to 2027.  If you look at my comments and the plans, we're now forecasting that our Permian production will reach about 1 million barrels a day by 2027. So very much in line going all the way back to 2018 and then the comments that we made around the pandemic and the delay that was introducing. So I think that's the context to think about what we're doing in the Permian and that development.  If you look at 2021, we added about 90,000 barrels a day of production. 2022, very similar number, 90,000 barrels a day. And that, in part, was what I'd call the organic development and the drilling and the production as well as clearing our DUCs inventory.  So as we were in the pandemic, obviously, not a lot of incentive to bring production on. And so we concentrated our spend on drilling. And then as we got into higher-priced environments, concentrated on clearing that inventory and bringing those wells to production. And so we were bringing our DUC inventory down. As we go into next year, we're going to rebuild that inventory, get to an optimum level that we can then use and maintain as we go through the next several years.  So that's kind of the strategy of how we're working that. If you think about ultimately getting to 1 million barrels a day by 2027, that's roughly a 13% compounded annual growth rate. That's going to -- that's not going to be steady every year. That will kind of fluctuate, call it, plus or minus 5%. But that's kind of order of magnitude how we'll see that playing out. And any 1 year's production will be a function of the development plans we have and how those development plans manifest themselves in that specific time frame.  But I think bottom line is we're basically on plan, moving at pace that we anticipated. And I'm hopeful that as we continue to focus on the technology developments and continuing to improve efficiency, we'll see either that production brought online with more effectively at lower cost or, in fact, more productivity and higher production. But that's a function of the ongoing work, we've got to bring our technology and operational capabilities to bear in the Permian, continue to improve what we're doing there. We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. So I wanted to ask about the chemicals business. And if we look at the margin chart that you have in the slide deck, it's the one part of the portfolio where margins are still below the 10-year range. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing there here as you move into early 2023 with China reopening and that potentially being a positive driver for margins.  And then also just talk through some of the discrete growth projects that you have coming on over the next few years to drive that earnings growth that you talked about at the Investor Day last year. I think Baytown, you noted later this year, and you have the China chemicals complex still a few years out, but some of the growth projects and the progress there as well. Yes, sure. I think let me just take both sides of the equation with chemicals. I'll start with the demand side of the equation, which you referenced. And you're right, I think one of the things we saw last year was with the China lockdowns and the lack of growth in China, which is a big, as you know, chemical market, that had an impact on the demand side of the equation.  My expectation as we move into this year and the China economy continues to open up, we'll see that demand pick back up again. And then again, a function of whether how deep and how widespread the recessions are around the world, that's going to have an impact. If current conventions and thinking holds and recessions are mild than people anticipated, I think that will see a benefit in the chemical on the demand side as well.  From the supply side, which isn't a big part of what's -- it's suppressing margins today. As we came out -- when we went into the pandemic, there were a lot of chemical projects that got put on hold and deferred investments. And you're now seeing, as we came out of the pandemic and you look at margins in 2021, 2022, very strong chemical margins. We saw those investments get leaned into and a lot of that capacity coming online. So we've got this large capacity additions coming on at the same time where you've had some demand slowdown.  So I think what we're seeing play out here is that what I would say is the typical supply-demand swings in that commodity cycle, exacerbated somewhat by the effects of the pandemic still kind of playing itself out, but not inconsistent with what we had anticipated coming out of the pandemic. And so it will be -- it will take a little time for that demand to pick up and then fill that capacity, but we'll get back on the growth trajectory and markets will get tight again. So that's how we're thinking about the chemical business.  With respect to our projects, feel really good about. We had to pause those, as you know, coming out of the pandemic, where we had to make some tough choices about how we spend our capital. We'd never done that before in terms of stopping some projects in midstream. But again, I'd tell you, the organization did a great job of putting those on pause, preserving where we are at, continuing to work with contractors to drive efficiency. And now we're bringing those back on basically in line with the plans that we've laid out in the pandemic.  So we just brought on the polypropylene unit in Baton Rouge. We've got our Baytown, Vistamaxx and LAO projects, which we anticipate coming on here middle of this year. And then China 1 is making really good progress and expect that to come on in 2025. So I think all those investments, we feel really good about and are on the path that we had anticipated. We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. I don't know which, whether you or Kathy, which 1 of you 2 would like to take this, but I want to ask you about your treatment of the European windfall taxes. My understanding is you are, I guess, suing to try and get some resolution there and treating these as nonrecurring. So can you walk us through your rationale versus how your peers are thinking about this? And any cash impacts that you had to incur in the current quarter, I guess, would be my clarification question. Sure. So I'll first just talk about the financial impact. In the current quarter, we wouldn't have had material impacts. Obviously, there were some countries in Europe that had passed incremental taxes earlier this year, so I'll point to Italy and the U.K. as an example. And so we would have been accruing those appropriately. You would have seen, as part of our identified items, that we booked $1.8 billion associated with 2022 overall increased additional European taxes.  Now in terms of the cash impact of that, it doesn't really hit in 2022. We just took the -- we took the overall accrual. And those payments will end up occurring both in 2023 and in 2024. It just depends on the individual countries. But if I take an overall step back, I'd say we looked at what happened in the EU and said both is not legal and it's the opposite of what is needed, right? So what's needed right now is more supply. And instead, what's been put in place is a penalty on the broad energy sector.  So I'd contrast that with what's happened more recently in the United States with the Inflation Reduction Act, right? There, you see policy that's put out to incent industry, both to accelerate technology and to accelerate investment that's greatly needed, especially in areas where the industries in terms of lowering emissions are still pretty nascent, things like hydrogen and CCS. And you're already seeing investments start to flow into those industries. And I would just add, Doug, I think, obviously, we've been engaged with governments throughout Europe. And I do think there is a sensitivity to the impact on future investments and industry's appetite to continue to invest in what is a challenging market environment in the first place with respect to Europe becoming more uncertain and less stable.  So I think there was some concern going into this. And my suspicion will be many an industry, this will be yet another reason to pull back on their investments in Europe. And I'm not sure you're going to then see that begin to propagate around the world just because of the negative impact it has on an industry that requires a stable policy and some certainty when you're making the size of investments that the industry makes over the time horizon that we make them in. So my sense is that there will be a lot of unintended negative consequences that come from this. And as that manifests itself, a lot less appetite for doing this. We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Darren, can you just make some sort of high-level comments about the competitive landscape you see across the business? I know this is a broad question, but in the Upstream, Energy Products, Low Carbon Solutions, how do you see competitors behaving? Sure. Yes, this is obviously a real important focus area for us. And let me just maybe start with a broad strategy and philosophy that you've seen us executing here over the last 5 years. And as I mentioned on CNBC this morning, I think we see that paying off with respect to the profit margins and the improvements that we're seeing in the profit margins.  If you look at 2012, when we had our last -- or higher revenues than we've got today, we made more money this year with less revenues, and that's really a function of the improvement in net profit margin where we went from about 10% net profit margin in 2012 to 14% in 2022. So I think a reflection of the work that we've been doing to better position ourselves competitively.  If I go down each of the sectors that we're in, I'll start with the Upstream where our emphasis has really been making sure that our -- the projects that we're pursuing are advantaged versus industry and, very importantly, are on the left-hand side of the cost-of-supply curve.  So our strategy there is we can't call the cycles, we can't predict where the markets will go and over what time frame, but we can control the cost of the barrels that we're bringing on and making sure that irrespective of the environment that we find ourselves in, that we are competitively positioned versus our competition and that our barrels are lower cost. And that's been the strategy.  And then for the portfolio where we don't see some of those advantages is to exit those businesses into high-grade portfolio. That's what we've been doing. I think you're seeing the benefits of that. We've also been very focused on kind of leaning in when others lean out, to use the language I used in the press release. And that, I think, is paying off as well. And I think resource owners around the world recognize our commitment to that industry and our capabilities with respect to effectively producing barrels.  So I think that's what we're doing there. I think we're very well positioned. We've got a really good portfolio, I think, a competitively advantaged portfolio, not only in the cost of supply, but in the quantity and the quality of the projects that we've got there.  In the chemical business, it's really around focused on performance products and making sure that we're leveraging our technology to develop products that have a high value to customers and, therefore, a higher margin. We build world-scale facilities, start them out on commodity grades and then quickly upgrade those and fill transition to performance products. That strategy continues to play out well. We're continuing to see a lot of pull on our performance products, and so that's our strategy there. And we continue to invest in that high-end, high-value product slate in the chemical business.  In refining, it's really around evolving the yield and the products that we make in our plants. I think contrary to maybe some of the conventional wisdom out there, we actually think the refineries that we're investing in position us well for, again, a very uncertain future, continuing to make the products that society needs today and doing that across a very diversified slate of products, so think chemicals, fuels products and lubricants; and then at the same time, investing to produce low-emissions fuels to address the low-carbon demand.  And as that piece of the market picks up, we've got a really good competitively advantaged base to shift that production, and you see us doing that. The Strathcona project is one example, but we have many, many other concepts in mind to transition our refinery production in line with that demand evolution, and it's really just a function of pacing that.  Again, I think that advantage us versus the rest of competition. Big refining footprint that's going to be needed for these and be advantaged in making low-emissions fuel. So I think we're well positioned there. Our chemical business is well positioned with the technology and the performance products that we're making. So I think we've got a leg up in that space.  And then finally, Low Carbon Solutions, there's a lot of activity in this space, a lot of interest, particularly with the IRA here in the U.S., but more generally around the world, I think a real focus on low-carbon opportunities. I think we're very well positioned there. This is not a game for start-ups. This is -- these are large, world-scale projects that require the kind of project expertise that we have, require the kind of size and balance sheet capacity that we have, requires the technology and operating experience that we have. So there's a lot of, I'd say, skills and capabilities needed in this market that lend themselves and are consistent with our capabilities and advantages.  So I think it will take a while for that to shake out, but I am convinced that we are very well competitively positioned in the Low Carbon Solutions business. And if you think about security of supply and counting on your partner to, say, sequester carbon for 100-plus years, I think you're going to want somebody who's been around for a while and knows how to do that. And I think we're the company to do that. If you want somebody who's going to guarantee that when they say they're going to have the barrels available to you, they're there, I think people will look to ExxonMobil to deliver on that. I feel pretty good about how we're positioned there as well. We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. A couple for Kathy, if I may. One, I was wondering if you could just address the balance sheet and how we're thinking about the differences in the cycle. So obviously, significant deleveraging and a 5% net debt to cap, I know that's not your target, but it is notable. So just wondering if you could address at what point do you start to think of the balance sheet as a bit of a drag and also your willingness to kind of continue to delever here, acknowledging that there was a lot of times in the corporation's history where the balance sheet was effectively unlevered. So I would start by saying we view our balance sheet very much as a competitive advantage, right? And we know that during the up part of the cycle, we've got to build a fortressed balance sheet to make sure we have all the firepower we need and all the flexibility we need to then manage the downturn, which will inevitably come.  So that's how we think about the balance sheet. I think we've made terrific progress. I mean, if you look overall this year, we paid down about $7 billion of debt. You already mentioned that our net debt to cap is about 5%. We obviously also learned a number of lessons during the pandemic, and we have said we have a willingness to carry a higher cash balance. Our cash balance is around $30 billion right now.  So I'd say, overall, at any given point in time, our cash balance is ultimately going to depend on how the market environment ensues. But we know having a really strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage for us. We've been very clear about our capital allocation priorities. And at the very top of that priority list is making sure we're consistently investing in advantaged projects, right?  We're in a quite good position in terms of having a very rich portfolio of advantaged projects, which we're bringing forward. And I think we've taken a very balanced approach in ultimately how we're sharing our rewards with shareholders. In 2022, we ended up distributing about $15 billion in dividends and $15 billion in a share repurchase program, so ensuring that we just have sustainable, growing, competitive dividends and efficiently returning cash to shareholders.  So that's how we think about it. And we are at the part of the cycle where you would expect us to see a very strong balance sheet, and we're very focused on ensuring that that's indeed what we have. We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. I'll ask about M&A actually because you're describing a number of advantages that are very unique to ExxonMobil, not just at a corporate level, but even in individual asset classes, for example, that you might be in the early stages of efficiency and productivity gains in the Permian, which is really different than a lot of other operators are saying.  So it seems like a opportunity to consolidate and create a lot of value, but at the same time, there's other countervailing forces against that. So maybe at this point, it would be great to just hear your thoughts on the overall M&A landscape and what kind of opportunities do you see and then also in the context of Kathy's comments on the balance sheet, which is obviously set up very well right now. Yes, sure. Thanks. And I'll touch on that and maybe let's see if Kathy has got anything to add. I think the point that you make is exactly the right one, which is looking at where we can take advantage of our capabilities and skills to bring additional value to acquisition targets. And that's really where we put our focus is where can we leverage what we're good at and bring value above and beyond what potential acquisition would be able to do without us. That's the focus area.  And I think we are in the area that you talked about. We do think with time, the work we've been doing in the Permian will provide a value opportunity that we can leverage when we -- when the market is right. And I think expectations start to align around values from a buyer standpoint as well as a seller standpoint. And so there's an element of that where it's difficult to go in and buy at the top of a commodity cycle.  You tend to want to -- at least I want to focus in on where you see more, I'd say, longer-term price cycles being priced into assets. That will be one of the functions or one of the things that you've got to consider in this space. But it really is and we continue to look for where we see the opportunity of bringing value for undeveloped resources in the Permian.  I think in the Low Carbon Solutions space, it's a very early business to earn a whole lot of opportunities there in that space, but with time, that could develop. And obviously, it's challenged in the chemical space with respect to the technology that we bring to bear on existing assets, but it's something that we continue to look at.  Kathy, anything to add there? So the only other thing I would add is, ultimately, we're focused on continuing to high-grade our portfolio overall. You would have seen in the past year in what's been a more buoyant market environment that we've made a number of divestments where others saw more value in those assets than we thought.  So we're always looking at both sides of this equation. And depending on the market and what's available and, again, how we think about synergies, how we think about retention and value, we'll look to transact, but only when we think it's going to earn good returns for our shareholders. We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with Cowen. The first one is for Kathy, just on a couple of items that I think impacted 4Q earnings. You had highlighted on the last earnings call that downstream trading benefits were particularly strong in 3Q, and I was wondering if that continued into the fourth quarter. And you also highlighted in the 8-K for 4Q earnings that inventory impacts would be a headwind, and I was hoping if you could quantify that as well. Yes. And so we, obviously, in the third quarter, quantified that we had a number of favorable timing impacts that we didn't necessarily think we're going to repeat. So when you think about Energy Products performance in this quarter, you should think about the absence of some of those positives that we had overall last quarter, right?  So if I look at that just on a quarterly basis, overall, we had from third quarter to fourth quarter in Energy Products unsettled derivatives of about $1 billion as a headwind. That's really the absence of largely a positive that we would have had in the third quarter.  And then again, in the third quarter, we talked about the fact that we have a program associated with achieving ratable pricing in our refinery runs. And that had given us, again, I'll call it, benefit in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, price timing differences were negative to the tune of about $400 million.  I think the most important thing, though, is to actually take a step back and look at the full year results because what we've told you during the year is, look, we're going to have these price timing impacts, especially mark-to-market on open derivative, positions are going to move around quarter-to-quarter and during the year. But if you looked at Energy Products on a full year basis, our unsettled derivatives were basically neutral, right?  And price timing impacts, and again, I would have referred to this coming largely out of our priced inventory program, were about a $400 million negative when we look at just 2021 to 2022. So like we have said all along, the quarter-to-quarter impact may be a little bit more volatile. But when you look at the full year results, it tends to settle itself out. Got it. And then on the inventory, the year-end inventory impacts? If you looked at overall year-end inventory impacts, they would have had the biggest impact in our Upstream business. And as part of the inventory adjustments we made, we had to look at gas inventories overall in Europe with prices declining pretty significantly. If you looked at our overall year-end adjustments to inventory outside of that, I would have called them kind of neutral to modestly favorable with the largest favorability incurring in Energy Products. Got it. And then my follow-up is just on downstream maintenance, which it seems like refining maintenance will be particularly high in 1Q. I wonder if that's just kind of a bunch of things getting -- just getting aggregated into 1 quarter, if it's going to be a higher year overall moving through the year, if there's something else going on. Just a little more color on that number and the outlook for the year would be great. Yes, I'll take that one. I would just say turnaround timing is really a function of -- and the spend that we have in that area is really a function of the mix and the units that we're bringing in at the different -- into turnarounds around the different refineries and the age of those units.  And so I wouldn't take away some structural change or outlook for the year. It's really just a function of which refineries and which units that those refineries are coming into turnaround and the work that we have to do to get those units back on their maintenance schedule. So that's what's happening there. We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Maybe a higher-level question, following up on some of your comments earlier on competitive position. Relative to past cycles, the competitive environment in upstream oil looks far different than many times in the past with both fewer players in the industry and many of your largest peers strategically under-investing in oil. How does it -- how do you think this impacts global supply over time? And how does it impact your -- as you look forward, how does it impact your competitive position within the space? Does it open the door for additional opportunities for you?  And in E&P projects, does it -- whether in terms of expiration leasehold, competition or project development or even within the asset transactions in the M&A space, have you seen an impact to date? And how do you think that evolves in the coming years with the changed competitive landscape? Yes, thanks. I'll take that one, Ryan. It's -- I think you hit on a very good point, which is -- and the point that we've made historically is there has -- we are under-investing as an industry in this space. And in the depletion business, we are not keeping up with that depletion or not offsetting it and covering the growth. You find yourself in tight markets.  And I think as the broader public narrative has moved in this space and some of our competitors have stepped back for investment there, that does tighten the amount of capacity that's coming on and the supply that gets brought in on over time. And until you have competitive alternatives, lower emissions, competitive alternatives that address the full set of needs for society, there's going to continue to be a demand for oil and gas and oil products.  And so I think you're seeing the potential for continued tight markets. I think we have found, certainly over the last 5 years, that our continued commitment to strengthening the capabilities that will allow us to bring on competitively sourced oil and gas and do that in an environmentally responsible way, that, that has resonated and is being recognized by resource owners around the world.  And so I do think that does give us a bit of an advantage with respect to the opportunity set. And I would say that we continue to work to earn the advantage by developing those resources very effectively, bringing projects on ahead of schedule, under budget and doing things that, frankly, some of our competitors are challenged to do. And so I think it's a very supportive environment that we find ourselves in. The focus that we have in this space, I think, is appreciated and gives us an advantage versus the rest of the competition.  And I'll also add that we're doing that while, at the same time, balancing the risk of the transition and investing in the low emission side of the equation. And so we've got this unique position where the same core capabilities that we're using to drive value in our traditional businesses, we're using those and leveraging them to drive value in the Low Carbon Solutions business and keeping a very keen eye on the developments in all those industries and making sure that we adjust our investments in our strategy and our allocation of capital based on the developments that we're seeing in those space.  So we've got optionality and we've got flexibility. And we've got a core set of competencies that lend themselves to every part of that -- of those businesses and across our portfolio. So I feel really good about that. And I think the folks that were out there or the partners that we're looking to partner with recognize that and value it. So I think we'll see that manifest itself in the deals that we continue to do and the businesses that we continue to grow. We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. I just wanted to ask on the Beaumont expansion and how the ramp is going there. And in terms of profitability, we've got Midland trading above Cushing now, but that's probably not significant given diesel cracks are very, very strong. So just wondering on the profitability of that project out of the gate relative to how you've been thinking about it when you sanctioned. Yes, I'll take it. As I said before, if you look at Beaumont, when we -- the concept of that project was developed 5-plus years ago. And it really was looking at what I would call the feedstocks and intermediate balances going into that refinery and the options that we had to optimize the logistics piece of the equation and justified that project purely on logistics optimizations and lower-cost transportation to feed that refinery. And that's kind of how we thought about that, so that is robust to wherever you're at within the cycle.  If you layer on where we're at today in the commodity cycle and the fact that we are at on the very high end of refining margins, my expectation is that, that refining expansion will do much, much better than what we -- the basis on which we appropriate it just because we find the timing of where we find ourselves in that cycle.  And that's good news. I mean that's, I think, an important part of the investments that we make to make sure that we're kind of participating in all phases of the cycle. But I think even better news is we're not depending on that to generate a return from that investment. So even as we move through the commodity cycle and at some point in the future, we find refining margins start to come off, and eventually, we'll find ourselves in the bottom of the refining commodity cycle.  That expansion will position our Beaumont refinery very well and will, I think, continue to be incremental to the value of that refinery. So feel really positive about that. We're making good progress. We mechanically completed that a little ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on ramping that facility up. Our last question will be from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Just wanted to follow up on Guyana. I think there was a lot of expectation at the Investor Day -- well, won't be an Investor Day, but there'd be a potentially big update on Guyana. I know things are going well there from a development standpoint, but I was just hoping you could address anything on the resource side and any update at all from a PSC political side. There's been a little noise out there on that end. Yes. I think the point you made, we're making really good progress. As we've said, we brought Liza 2 in ahead of schedule. We anticipate bringing Payara in ahead of schedule. We brought Liza 2 up very well, brought that online quickly and began producing at above nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. And so I feel really good about the quality of those projects and the operational ability to bring those up and run them effectively, making good progress there. We've got Yellowtail in for government approval. I expect that to be a bigger FPSO.  So we're making -- I would say we're at or ahead of the schedule and ahead of the expectations that we've talked about historically with Guyana. The resource base, as you know, continues to grow. We continue to make discoveries. We continue to really optimize around those discoveries. And that's a really big part of developing these projects is as we are in parallel to developing projects, continuing the exploration and then continuing to better quantify and qualify that resource base is making sure that our projects are optimized around that. So there's a balance that we're striking around how best to optimize, and feel good about what we're doing there. And frankly, I think the government feels really good about what we're doing there.  Importantly, the development of that resource and the value associated with that is manifesting itself in the country, which is a really important part of the equation here. We always said coming into this that this has to be a win-win-win proposition, needs to be a win for the company, it needs to be a win for the government of Guyana and it needs to be a win for the people of Guyana. And that's what we're seeing there, a lot of jobs, a lot of economic opportunity opening up in Guyana.  We've just -- we've been working with the Guyanese government around a project to bring in gas power into the country, lower emissions and more reliable. We've got work going on to help bring up some of the other social services in the country. So I think people are seeing the progress. And the fact that we're bringing this on sooner and at lower cost, I think, is a benefit to the government. They recognize the values coming faster than originally anticipated. So it's a -- I think it's a good story of government, I think, and ExxonMobil, got very good relationships, working very constructively. And as I said, it's a win-win-win proposition here and feel good about the progress we're making. And any thoughts on the resource base or the next time you'll offer an update on that? I think as the team continues to drill and then quantify and characterize the results of those drills, when it gets to a material improvement, we'll be out talking about that. Thank you, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our investor website by the end of the week. Have a nice day, everyone. And I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude our call. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."

         "Good morning. My name is Stephen, and I will be your facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the UPS Investor Relations Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ken Cook, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, the floor is yours. Good morning, and welcome to the UPS Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Carol Tome, our CEO; Brian Newman, our CFO; and a few additional members of our executive leadership team. Before we begin, I want to remind you that some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements within the federal securities laws and address our expectations for the future performance or operating results of our company.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which are described in our 2021 Form 10-K, subsequently filed Form 10-Qs and other reports we filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the SEC. Unless stated otherwise, our discussion refers to adjusted results. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP results include a noncash after-tax mark-to-market pension gain of $782 million, a onetime noncash after-tax charge of $384 million, resulting from accelerated vesting of restricted performance units in connection with the change in incentive compensation program design. A noncash after-tax charge of $58 million from a reduction in the residual value of our MD-11 aircraft and after-tax transformation and other charges of $41 million. The after-tax total for these items is $299 million, a benefit to fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.34 per diluted share. Additional details regarding year-end pension adjustments are included in the appendix of our fourth quarter 2022 earnings presentation that will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website later today. A reconciliation to GAAP financial results is available on the UPS Investor Relations website along with the webcast of today's call. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'll turn the call over to Carol. Thank you, Ken, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking UPSers for delivering what matters to our customers this holiday season. In the quarter, we were faced with choppy demand, continued COVID lockdowns in China, a threat of a rail strike in the United States and a bomb cyclone in North America. But no matter what came our way, our team delivered.  We executed another outstanding peak and delivered industry-leading service for the fifth consecutive year. I am very proud of our team and what we accomplished, not just in the quarter but for the entire year. Looking at our fourth quarter results, we expected volume levels to decline from last year, and they did, but more than we planned due to macro conditions that Brian will discuss. We responded by managing our network with agility and a focus on service.  Consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from last year. And operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3%. While our consolidated operating margin declined by 10 basis points from last year to 14.1%, our U.S. operating margin expanded to 12.8% and reached a level not seen in 10 years. Reflecting back on 2022, much changed from when we originally set our plans.  We experienced geopolitical tensions, including a war, and global inflation drove food and energy costs higher. We saw both relief and concern as China pivoted away from its Zero COVID policy. Global supply chains continue to adjust and demand and pricing for air and ocean freight softened accordingly. Consumers returned to pre-pandemic shopping behaviors as retailers have been successful in attracting consumers back into stores.  And we won't even talk about the weather, which candidly presented challenges throughout the year. Even in the face of so much change, UPSers remained focused on controlling what we can control, and we delivered our full year consolidated operating margin and return on invested capital targets. In 2022, consolidated revenue increased 3.1% to reach $100.3 billion.  We missed our revenue target by about 2%. But as Brian will detail, nearly all of this miss was due to a stronger dollar than originally anticipated. Consolidating operating profit in 2022 totaled $13.9 billion, 5.4% higher than last year, and consolidated operating margin reached 13.8%. We generated $9 billion in free cash flow. And diluted earnings per share were $12.94, an increase of 6.7%.  During the year, we stayed on strategy. Customer first, people led, innovation driven. As we've discussed, customer first is about creating a frictionless customer experience targeted at certain customer segments, including SMBs and Healthcare. Since its inception, we've had huge success with DAP, our Digital Access Program and making it easier for SMB customers to do business with UPS.  In 2022, we generated more than $2.3 billion in DAP revenue exceeding our target. We expect the momentum to continue and plan to generate around $3 billion in global DAP revenue in 2023. And with the launch of Deal Manager in 2022, we've made progress toward dynamic pricing. Deal Manager digitizes the pricing process and applies pricing science to present the right offer to our SMB customers the first time. So we are able to close deals faster and with better revenue quality.  In 2022, our U.S. win rate with Deal Manager was 22 percentage points higher than the baseline. So we are moving quickly to expand access to Deal Manager to more than 40 countries in 2023. Additionally, we recently launched a pilot that enables systematic day of week pricing, which is good for our customers and good for UPS. Early feedback is promising, and we'll share more updates on this pilot on future calls.  Looking at SMBs, they made up 28% of our total U.S. volume in 2022, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2021. Turning to Healthcare. In 2022, our Healthcare portfolio reached $9.2 billion in revenue, and the quality of our offerings was best-in-class. Our goal is to become the #1 complex health care logistics provider in the world. Today, we have nearly 17 million square feet of healthcare-compliant distribution space globally with leading cold chain logistics capabilities.  In 2023, we expect our Healthcare portfolio to generate more than $10 billion in revenue. We don't just look at volume and revenue to measure our success. We also look at our Net Promoter Score. In 2022, the improvements we saw in our Net Promoter Score outpaced the competition. We made strong gains in all 16 customer journeys, including the 3 most important; negotiate value, reroute a package and resolve a claim. We are well on our way to our NPS target of 50.  Turning to people led. Here, we are focused on the employee experience and making UPS a great place to work. For our frontline employees, we made organizational design changes to address certain work-life balance challenges. We've stepped up maintenance spending in our buildings, including updating break rooms and restrooms, refreshing paint, improving lighting and adding cooling stations.  And for our management employees, nearly 40,000 around the world, we've been laser-focused on improving our likelihood to recommend score or LTR. When I started with the company, LTR stood at 51%. It is now 60%, and we would like it to be 80% or higher. And looking at the drivers of dissatisfaction, the largest area of concern was pay, not the total amount of pay, but rather the pay mix structure. So we've taken action to fix it.  Beginning in 2023, we are changing the pay mix structure by increasing the cash component. This shift does not change total compensation for our management employees, but does increase cash. We also accelerated the vesting of stock awards associated with our annual bonus plans. This was a onetime noncash charge. Beginning in 2023, management incentive plan annual bonuses, if earned, will be paid in cash.  Regarding our upcoming labor contract negotiation, we are well prepared for negotiations and are focused on achieving an agreement that is a win for our employees, a win for the Teamsters and a win for UPS and our customers. We have great jobs with industry-leading pay and benefits. Now I suspect many of you listening today would like details of our negotiating strategy. Well, we believe the best way to achieve a win-win-win outcome is for us to leave the details of the negotiations at the bargaining table. So let's move on to the last leg of our strategy, innovation driven. We believe innovation is one reason we've been able to provide our customers with industry-leading service for 5 peaks in a row. By leveraging the agility and efficiency of our integrated network, our engineers and operating teams quickly make decisions to adjust the network and keep service levels high.  This year, we supplemented our engineering tools with our total service plan, which further improved our on-time network and drove productivity. In the fourth quarter, hours deployed in the U.S. dropped 5.3%, which was greater than the decrease in volume. And in terms of cube utilization, our efforts in the fourth quarter enabled us to eliminate nearly 1,500 trailer loads per day.  We are relentlessly focused on making our network even more efficient. We were very pleased with the initial results of our Smart Package, Smart Facility RFID initiative, where we are seeing fewer missloads and higher productivity. As a result, this year, we plan to complete the RFID deployment in the more than 900 buildings across the U.S. In 2022, we created a new growth platform we call Logistics-as-a-Service, which combines digital capabilities with our best-in-class global integrated network.  Under this platform, we launched our delivery density solution, where we continue to add customers and are seeing positive results. Lastly, we can't talk about innovation without speaking to the progress we are making against our environmental sustainability targets. In 2022, we took delivery of over 2,300 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, bringing our rolling laboratory to more than 15,600. And in 2023, we plan to add more than 2,400 vehicles as we move towards carbon neutrality by 2050.  We think the best way to measure innovation driven is by delivering higher returns on invested capital. For the full year 2022, we delivered a return on invested capital of 31.3%, 50 basis points above 2021. Let me close with a few comments related to 2023. The outlook for economic growth is cloudy at best, geopolitical tensions are rising, and we have a labor contract to negotiate.  For us, it is a year of resilience. What does resilience mean? It means we will plan conservatively and pivot quickly. It means we will balance defensive and offensive moves, and it means we will execute what we call our wildly important initiatives. Specifically, we will balance efficiency moves with growth opportunities. Think of that as better and bolder. We will stop certain initiatives and accelerate others, thereby increasing investment in our business. Relative to 2022, we are increasing our 2023 expense and capital budget by over $900 million.  Finally, we'll focus on 3 wildly important initiatives: improving the customer value proposition, increasing talent development and employee engagement, and leveraging our physical network with our digital platform to drive Logistics-as-a-Service. Given the uncertainty ahead, we are providing a range for our 2023 revenue and profit outlook. Brian will provide the details. As a demonstration of confidence in our business going forward, and in concert with our capital allocation principles, the UPS Board has approved a $0.10 increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.52 per share to $1.62 per share.  This is the 14th consecutive year we have increased the UPS dividend. Additionally, our Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing our existing authorization. In closing, over the past 2.5 years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business, and we're just getting started. Uncertainty creates opportunity, and this team has proven that it's up for the challenge. So thank you for listening. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Thanks, Carol, and good morning. In my comments, I'll cover 3 areas. Starting with our fourth quarter results, then I'll review our full year 2022 results, including cash and share owner returns. And lastly, I'll provide comments on expectations for the macro environment and our financial outlook for 2023. In the fourth quarter, the macro environment was challenging. In the U.S., inflation-sensitive consumers returned to more pre-pandemic shopping patterns and holiday retail sales were lower than expected, especially after Cyber Week.  Internationally, demand in Europe remained under pressure. Ocean and air freight rates declined and exports out of Asia worsened due to COVID conditions in China. Despite these conditions in the fourth quarter, we responded quickly and again delivered for our customers and share owners. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $27 billion, down 2.7% from the fourth quarter of last year, and operating profit was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  Consolidated operating margin was 14.1% for the quarter, down 10 basis points from the same time period last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share was $3.62, up 0.8% from the same period last year. Now let's look at our business segments. In U.S. Domestic, revenue quality initiatives more than offset the decline in volume and drove strong fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, average daily volume was down 3.8% versus the same time period last year with about half of the decrease coming from our largest customer per the mutually beneficial contractual agreement we reached some time ago.  In the fourth quarter, volume in October and November came in as we expected, including a surge in late November from Black Friday through Cyber Week. In December, volume fell short of our expectations, reflecting consumer spending cutbacks at the height of the holiday season. B2C average daily volume declined 3% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. B2B average daily volume in the fourth quarter was down 5.2% year-over-year, driven by declines in retail and industry sectors that are more sensitive to rising interest rates like manufacturing and distribution.  In the fourth quarter, B2B represented 35.3% of our volume, which was down slightly from 35.8% in the same time period last year. Looking at customer mix, SMBs made up 26.5% of our total U.S. Domestic volume in the fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 1 year ago and the 10th consecutive quarter of increased SMB penetration. For the quarter, U.S. Domestic generated revenue of $18.3 billion, up 3.1%.  Revenue per piece increased 7.2%, driven by revenue quality, which more than offset the decline in volume. Improvements in base pricing more than offset a small decline due to product mix and together drove about half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase. The remaining half of the revenue per piece growth rate increase was driven by the combination of higher fuel price per gallon and our fuel pricing actions.  Turning to costs. Total expense grew 2.5%. First, higher fuel costs contributed about 150 basis points of the total expense growth rate increase. Second, higher wages and benefit expense contributed 150 basis points of the increase. Total union wage rates were up 5.6% in the fourth quarter, driven by the annual wage increase and cost of living adjustment for our Teamster employees that went into effect in August of 2022.  Productivity initiatives helped partially offset the increase in expense. For example, Total Service Plan has improved driver dispatch time by 7.9% since its launch in July 2022. This is helping us run an on-time network. And in the fourth quarter, we increased total productivity by 1.6% as defined by pieces per hour. Lower purchase transportation expenditures reduced the total expense growth rate by around 140 basis points, primarily from utilizing UPS feeder drivers to support our fastest ground ever and continued optimization efforts.  And the remaining expense growth rate increase was driven by multiple factors, including maintenance and depreciation. Looking specifically at our peak period, our sales, engineering and operating teams planned and executed another successful peak. We used our technology to maximize the agility of our integrated network, including our newest regional hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, all of which enabled us to respond to changes in volume levels and difficult weather as winter storms rolled across the country close to Christmas.  Our network never stopped, and we provided industry-leading service to our customers for the fifth year in a row. The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $2.3 billion in operating profit, up 7.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. And operating margin was 12.8%, a year-over-year increase of 60 basis points. Moving to our International segment. The macro environment was challenging and resulted in lower volume than we anticipated in the fourth quarter.  We leveraged the agility of our global network to quickly adjust capacity while delivering excellent service to customers. In the fourth quarter, International average daily volume was down 8.6%. The decline was primarily driven by a 12.9% decrease in domestic average daily volume and weakness out of Asia due to COVID. Total export average daily volume in the fourth quarter declined 4% on a year-over-year basis.  Asia export average daily volume declined 10.3%, driven by lower global demand and disruptions to manufacturing output from the changes in China's COVID policy. In response, we quickly adjusted the network and canceled over 200 of our China and Hong Kong origin flights, maintained high service levels and achieved a payload utilization of over 98% on our Asia outbound intercontinental flights.  In the fourth quarter, International revenue was $5 billion, down 8.3% from last year due to the decline in volume and a $321 million negative impact from currency. Revenue per piece was relatively flat year-over-year, but there were a number of moving parts, including a 660 basis point decline due to a stronger U.S. dollar, a 540 basis point increase from fuel surcharges and the remaining increase of 100 basis points was due to the combination of multiple factors, including favorable product mix, base price increases and lower demand-related surcharge revenue.  Operating profit in the International segment was $1.1 billion, down $240 million from last year due to a $139 million reduction in demand-related surcharge revenue and a $98 million negative impact from currency. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 22%. Now looking at Supply Chain Solutions. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.8 billion, down $846 million year-over-year.  Looking at the key drivers. In Forwarding, softer global demand drove down volume and market rates more than we expected, resulting in lower revenue and operating profit. Logistics partially offset the declines in Forwarding and delivered double-digit revenue and operating profit growth driven by gains in our complex Healthcare business from cold chain and clinical trials customers.  In the fourth quarter, Supply Chain Solutions generated an operating profit of $403 million, and operating margin was 10.5%. Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $182 million of interest expense. Our other pension income was $297 million, and our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4%. Now let me comment on our full year 2022 results. In 2022, we remain focused on controlling what we could control and provided excellent service to our customers, which enabled us to deliver our consolidated operating margin and return on invested capital targets.  A few consolidated highlights. Revenue reached $100.3 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion over 2021. This was $1.7 billion below our $102 billion revenue target, but included a $1.3 billion year-over-year negative impact from currency. In 2022, we generated operating profit of $13.9 billion, an increase of 5.4% over full year 2021. Consolidated operating margin was 13.8%, an increase of 30 basis points.  We increased our ROIC to 31.3%, up 50 basis points compared to last year. We generated $14.1 billion in cash from operations and continued to follow our capital allocation priorities. We invested $4.8 billion in CapEx. Additionally, we acquired Bomi Group and Delivery Solutions and made an investment in CommerceHub. We distributed $5.1 billion in dividends, which represented a 49% increase on a per share basis over 2021.  We repaid $2 billion in debt that matured during the year, and our net pension liability decreased by over $3 billion, both of which helped us reach our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4 turns, giving us ample financial flexibility to continue deploying capital to create value for our share owners. Lastly, we completed $3.5 billion in share buybacks in 2022. And in the segments for the full year, in U.S. Domestic, operating profit was $7.6 billion, up 12.8%, and we expanded operating margin to 11.8%, a year-over-year increase of 70 basis points.  The International segment generated $4.4 billion in operating profit, and operating margin was 22.4%. And Supply Chain Solutions delivered operating profit of $1.9 billion, an increase of $153 million and operating margin was 11.3%, an increase of 150 basis points over 2021. Moving to our outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 to be a bumpy year due to rising interest rates, decades high inflation, recession forecasts, a war in Eastern Europe, COVID disruptions in China and our U.S. labor negotiations. While we anchor our plans to S&P Global's economic forecast, we have developed multiple planned scenarios that will help us quickly pivot in an uncertain macro environment.  Further given our financial strength and solid cash position, we are increasing strategic investments to enhance our ability to capture growth opportunities as we come out of this cycle. I'd like to share 2 of those scenarios with you now, which are the basis for the guidance we are providing this year. The first is our base case that delivers the high end of the target range, and the second scenario includes additional top line risks and represents the low end of the range.  Let's start with our assumptions for the base case at a segment level. In the U.S., we expect a mild recession in the first half of the year, with a moderate recovery in the second half of the year. In the U.S. Domestic segment, we anticipate average daily volume will be down slightly due to our continued volume lie down from our contractual agreement with our largest customer, which will be nearly offset with growth from SMB and other enterprise customers.  And we expect volume growth to be better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We also expect the revenue growth rate to be low single digits. On the cost side, while we will manage the network to match volume levels, we have increased both capital and operating expenses for projects that drive efficiency and growth. One example is the accelerated deployment of our Smart Packaged, Smart Facility initiative to all remaining U.S. facilities, which we plan to complete by the end of the year.  And on the growth front, we will continue to invest in improving the customer experience. Putting it all together, we expect to grow revenue per piece at a faster rate than cost per piece and expand full year Domestic operating margin to 12%. Turning to International in 2023. In our base case plan, we expect a recession in Europe in the first half of the year. And in China, we expect weak demand in the first quarter with recovery beginning in the second quarter.  We are accelerating initiatives like International DAP to help us gain share and partially offset macroeconomic softness. We anticipate International average daily volume will decline by low single digits, with volume growth better in the second half of the year compared to the first. We expect revenue to decline by low single digits, including reductions in demand-related surcharges. We will continue to manage our costs with agility and expect to generate an operating margin of around 21%.  Turning to Supply Chain Solutions. We expect revenue to be around $14.6 billion as forwarding volumes will remain challenged and market rates will fall from year-end 2022 levels. We expect to partially offset declines in forwarding revenue from double-digit growth in our health care business, resulting in an operating margin of nearly 11%. In our downside plan, which represents the low end of our range, we start with our base case assumptions for all segments and layer in the following.   In U.S. Domestic, we reduced expected enterprise and SMB volume growth rates resulting in a full year volume decline of around 3% versus 2022. In International, we layer in weaker demand out of Asia for the entire first half of the year and a slower recovery in Europe in the second half of the year resulting in a mid-single-digit decline in average daily volume.   And in Supply Chain Solutions, we lowered our assumptions for air and ocean freight forwarding market volume and rates, which reduced full year revenue for Supply Chain Solutions by around $200 million. Bringing it all together, for the full year 2023, we expect consolidated revenues to be between $97 billion and $99.4 billion and consolidated operating margin to be between 12.8% and 13.6% with more than half of our operating profit coming in the second half of the year.  Now turning to pension. There are a couple of factors to keep in mind as you update your models. First, beginning in 2023, we froze our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. nonunion employees and have replaced it with enhanced 401(k) benefits. Second, high discount rates at the end of 2022 will result in lower service costs in 2023. Above the line, we expect the combination of these 2 factors will reduce operating expenses by approximately $420 million in 2023 with around 90% of the reduction in the U.S. Domestic segment.  Below the line, we expect pension income of around $260 million for the full year 2023, which is $930 million less than in 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates, resulting in an increase in pension interest expense and a reduction in the value of our pension assets from market performance in 2022. We've included a few slides in the appendix of today's webcast deck to provide you more detail. The webcast deck will be posted to the UPS Investor Relations website following this call.   Now let's turn to full year 2023 capital allocation. Our capital priorities have not changed and we will continue to make the best long-term investment decisions that will keep us on strategy and enable us to strengthen our customer value proposition and capture growth coming out of this cycle. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion, and here are a few project highlights. We will invest $2.4 billion in buildings and facilities to add automated sort capabilities and increase efficiency across the network and we'll add 2.4 million square feet of health care logistics space to our global network.   We will invest $1.3 billion in vehicles, including adding more than 2,400 alternative fuel vehicles to our fleet. We will invest $745 million in our air fleet, including taking delivery of seven 767 aircraft in 2023. And in terms of IT, we will invest $830 million, which includes accelerating the rollout of Smart Package, Smart Facility in the U.S., continuing to develop our delivery density solutions and building out our logistics as a service platform.  And lastly, across these projects and others, over $1 billion of investment will support our carbon neutral goals. Now let's turn to our expectations for cash and the balance sheet. We expect free cash flow to be around $8 billion in our base case. Consistent with our policy of a stable and growing dividend, the Board has approved a dividend per share of $1.62 for the first quarter, which represents a 6.6% increase in our dividend.   We are planning to pay out around $5.4 billion in dividends in 2023, subject to Board approval. We plan to buy back around $3 billion of our shares. And finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5% with the tax rate higher in the first quarter compared to the rest of the year due to the timing of our employee stock awards. In closing, we are focused on controlling what we can control, and we will continue to invest in our business to balance efficiency and growth opportunities under our better and bolder framework.   The fundamental changes we've made to our business coupled with the continued execution of our strategy will help us navigate what's ahead in 2023. Thank you, and operator, please open the lines. And Stephen, one note before we do that, we did experience a technical difficulty with the webcast this morning. So apologies to those of you who missed a portion of our prepared remarks. We plan to post the full recording of today's call to our Investor Relations website shortly after the completion of our call. So Stephen, please open the lines. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Brian, that was really helpful guidance framework. So I appreciate that. A couple of just clarification points. I guess the net service cost benefit is 0 in Domestic if I look at the service component. I'm just trying to understand how much of that margin uplift is actually a gross and net service. I don't know if you talked about -- I might have missed it, sorry, there are a lot of numbers there, if you talked about the financial impact from what you're assuming on the new labor deal.   So if you could just talk about those 2 items? And then Carol, there's a lot of rhetoric that's heating up on the labor contract. It seems like every day we wake up, there's a new big article about it. Wondering what your message is to enterprise customers that may start to get a little bit uneasy with all the rhetoric that's heating up out there? Thanks, Amit. I'll get started. We had about $420 million of benefit to our consolidated operating cost and that, Amit, is being offset with investments. So that $420 million specifically, I think you were talking about the Domestic business, which is $380 million of the $420 million, which is worth about $0.07 on a CPP.   So when you think about the investments we're going to make into the business, which are about $400 million, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that basically offsets the pension service cost impact to Domestic. So it's more of a one for one. On the labor front, so we've modeled in rates in both our base and our downside scenario, Amit. And I'm not going to get into the wage and benefit component of that, but I guess there's a broader labor question in there. And I'm happy to address the labor question. Without getting into the details of what will take place at the bargaining table, I think it's important to remember that Teamsters have been part of the UPS family for more than 100 years. So over 10 decades, we've negotiated many, many contracts. This is not our first raw deal. Our approach with the Teamsters is win-win-win. Win for the Teamsters, win for our employees and win for UPS and our customers.  Now, Amit, to your observations, there have been a lot of articles and headlines recently that might cause someone to question whether or not a win-win-win is achievable. But I would submit that a win-win-win is very achievable because we are not far apart on the issues. And let me make this real for you by giving you a few examples. First, both Teamsters and UPS agree that a healthy and growing UPS is good; good for Teamsters, good for our people and good for our customers.   In fact, we've added more than 70,000 Teamster jobs since 2018. So we're aligned that a growing and healthy UPS is good. To be growing and healthy, we need to be competitive and make sure that our offerings meet the needs of our customers, and a lot has changed since the last time we negotiated our contract. Recipients want their packages delivered when, where and how they want them delivered, which means we can delivery while it's become tablespace.   Teamsters fully acknowledge that, but have worried about the pressures placed on our workforce with weekend operations. And they refer to that to the sixth punch, which is when people worked 6 days a week or 22.4 drivers. We show the same concerns. I don't want people working 6 days a week unless they want to. So we're aligned on this. We just need to get to the bargaining table and work it out. And candidly, we think with just a few tweaks to our existing contract, we can work this out.   So we're not far apart. We're aligned. We just need to work it out. Another matter that's come up is heat. There can be no dispute sadly that the earth is heating up. And that puts an uncomfortable situation on our employees in the height of the summer. Safety is our #1 priority for our people. So we're not a part of this issue. In fact, we're not waiting for the bargaining table. We've already kicked off a total revamp of our safety program, bringing in new technology, hydration, cooling systems and a whole lot more to address heat.   So we're not apart. We're going to do the right thing for our people. So those are just a few examples of where I see a win-win-win is achievable. In fact, I'm committed to delivering with the rest of the team a win-win-win contract before the end of July. Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Wanted to ask if -- Brian, if you could run through the productivity programs and put some ballpark around the impact that you expect Smart Package, Smart Facility TSP, if you have other programs that are notable so we can have a little more visibility on how to think about productivity in -- and I'm thinking in Domestic package in 2023? Sure, Tom. Well, look, Nando and the team have done a great job in pivoting and really driving productivity in the fourth quarter. They did an outstanding job, and we're calling for low single-digit on our TPP in 2023. I referenced some of the investments that I think you're talking about in terms of Smart Package, Smart Facility. Maybe if I unpack those, you get a sense of where we're investing.   So Smart Package, Smart Facility, that really drives productivity inside the buildings, but it also improves the customer experience by reducing misloads. I think misloads today are running about 1 in 400 post the Smart Package, Smart Facility, will be up at 1 in 800. And there's a path to something higher beyond that. And then there's accelerating pilots for Phase 2, which is Smart Package car.   Another area we're investing in, probably the second largest is health care. That's a great growth business for us. We're going to be adding about 2.4 million square feet in warehouse space next year, some of that outside the U.S., half in EU and half in Americas. And then DAP has been a great performer for us. We're going to continue to invest in the DAP program, both domestically and internationally, enhancing the plug-and-play and having brokerage and UPS access points in terms of capability.   And then there's further investments into the customer experience and next-gen brokerage. So Tom, I think we have a lot of confidence in terms of the ability to drive total service plans, the investments we're making in Smart Package; Smart Facility, health care, DAP. And that's what's contributing to the low single-digit CPP in 2023. And maybe just to dimensionalize it a little bit more. In the fourth quarter alone in the United States, productivity reduced our expense by $271 million. I mean, that's a lot, that's a lot. I'm really proud of the team. And just on Smart Package, Smart Facility because I'm just so enthralled with this project, we have -- of the 100 buildings that we're in, we have 50 buildings where the misloads are now 1 in 1000. That's 6 Sigma perfection. So we're really excited about rolling it out to the 940 remaining buildings in the United States.   And here's the cool thing. We're going to roll out the first part of those buildings with wearable devices, but then we've got plans to move away from the devices and actually make the car smart. And last week, I was able to load a package, this is in a laboratory, I was able to load a package onto a smart car and saw the car actually checking the package, no human being did that. So this is way cool technology, and we're excited about the productivity that that's going to bring as a result. And to Tom, just from a seasonality perspective, we have planned productivity gains year-over-year in every quarter in '23. And so, Nando and the team will be reducing hours more than volume in the U.S. through the programs Carol and I just alluded to TSP and the automated capacity. So it's a balanced program. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. So if you step back from the guidance at the midpoint, your EBIT number is down, call it, 6% from 2023 levels. And obviously, we are coming into a choppy macro. Carol or Brian, can you talk about the levers that you need to pull to kind of get reaccelerating growth? And how much of that is going to be sort of macro dependent?  As we think about the bridge from wherever we end up at '23 to '24, I'm just curious to get your perspective on what are the catalyzing agents that would reverse the trend in overall EBIT growth? Well, I think there are a number of catalyzing agents. We need to get through this choppy economic environment for sure. But if you think about where we've had some huge home runs, let's talk about our digital access program. We have seen enormous growth in this. When I started, it was less than $150 million, now over $2.3 billion in 2022, on its way to be $3 billion in 2023. And we're growing outside of the United States.  It has been just a U.S. program. Now we're going outside the United States, and this is one area of investment for next year. So that's a catalyst for growth because we're investing in a customer that's underserved today. Another catalyst for growth is what we're doing on the customer journey. As we continue to move the needle on improving the experience with us, we see every year increasing penetration in our SMBs, Brian. And that's part of the plan for next year. That's right. So we'll be adding about 100 basis points, Carol, from a volume mix perspective on the SMB front. So that customer experience translating into continued growth on the SMB front. And from a macro perspective, obviously, built into the guide is an improvement in the back half of the year. So we need to see a bit of a pickup in Asia and the U.S. rebounding somewhat from a backdrop perspective. Another catalyst for growth, of course, is Healthcare logistics. Couldn't be more proud of the progress that we've made in this space, and we're just getting started. There's a huge opportunity for growth here around the world, and Kate and her team are doing a masterful job of leading us there. And as you think about the OpEx that you're putting in to offset some of the above-the-line sort of service cost, is that sort of onetime in nature? Is that just project-based work around implementing our FAD in the facilities? Is there some cost drag there that comes away? Or is that just cost drag that moves on to the next initiative? I'm just trying to think from a puts and takes perspective. Now some of the investments, international debt, for example, we're investing in the first part of the year. That will start to pay back the latter part of the year. And then the deployment of Smart Package, Smart Facility, that's probably more of a payback in '24 than '23 as we phase -- complete Phase 1 and start to move on to Phase 2. To dimensionalize the investment that we're making in Smart Package, Smart Facility, it's about $140 million of expense this year, which will not repeat the following year and about $106 million of capital. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Carol, great to hear the target to have the contract done by the end of July. I think last year we talked to you, you weren't even planning on sitting down early. So I think that's encouraging to hear. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what the largest customer kind of represented full year for '22, your thoughts? I know you talked about the pace of the loss of that business, but it sounds like it's accelerating into '23. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that in perspective of your countering SMB wins. And then on International to maintain that 21%, Brian, what's the assumptions in there to maintain that level? Sure. On the Amazon front, Ken, we finished up a year ago at 11.7% in terms of the percentage of Amazon as a percentage of our business, that came down to 11.3% in last year. So it was really a decline of about 40 basis points. We'll continue on a mutually agreed path to glide that business down in 2023, and that's factored into our guide. So we feel good about being able to manage that down.  On the International front, Ken, it was the second part of your question. So we've got an assumption that Asia comes back in the second half of the year. So that's -- they're going through some challenges right now in the early part of the year. There was a 2-week lunar holiday. We had some COVID challenges, particularly out of China. So Kate and the team, they've done a masterful job in the fourth quarter and also in the beginning of this year in terms of pivoting our air network. I think Kate took down about 200 flights in Asia, which was really remarkable that they were able to do that in such a short period of time. So managing the air network, seeing a little bit of a rebound in China and then getting after the opportunities that we're investing in, International DAP was one I just mentioned and then going after the premium side of the market. So lots of encouraging optimism for the back half of the year. And agility really is the name of the game, isn't it? Here it is. It's the end of January. I would say, our crystal ball is pretty murky, but I can tell you what we're seeing in the business today. The U.S. is actually doing a bit better than the base case. And International is doing a bit worse because we're in now a 2-week Lunar New Year holidays, who would have thought. But with herd immunity coming, we believe in China, things should get better outside the United States. And just to clarify, that 11.3%. I think, Carol, you had mentioned that you were targeting maybe less than 11% on Amazon for '22. So it sounds like maybe it's not drifting away as fast as an accelerating decline? No, Ken, really it's a function of currency. FX impacted our top line by $1.3 billion. So having not had the pressure on the top line, the percentage would have been different. Does that make sense? Yes. Absolutely. Of course. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. So I just want to make sure I'm understanding the guidance piece this year. So I think you said in the base case, Brian, the U.S. margin is 12%. And can you talk about where you see it in the downside scenario? And then you talked about more than half of the operating profit in the second half of the year. I mean, it's typically somewhere between 50% and 55%. Should we think anything differently? I don't know if you want to give us a little bit more color on first half or second half profit margins and any color there? Yes Scott, good to hear from you. So I'll start with the latter question first. We expect about 56% of our profit to come in the second half of the year relative to 1H. And then I would also just give you a little bit of color. There will be a similar bathtub effect in the first half between 1Q and 2Q stepping up in 2Q. From a Domestic guide perspective, the other half of your question, Nando and the team are focused on 12%.  That was actually the same number that we had guided to back in our Investor Day, and I'd say, the world has changed a little bit since then, but we're getting after the 12% margin in 2023. The low end is based on 11%. And so there are a number of things that are factored in there. The biggest change would be a change in the top line relative to volume. If the macro doesn't come back as quickly as we think it might, there's labor negotiations going on. So we thought it was prudent to put a floor in. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Great. I wanted to ask on the expectations for revenue per piece in U.S. Domestic. If I kind of -- Brian, you teased out kind of the comments, you've got revenue in the base case up low single digits, volume down slightly. So revenue per piece maybe low to mid-single digits, a bit of a deceleration from where you've been over the last 2 years. You've obviously done a good job of moving that up. But can you talk about the ability to see continued improvement in revenue per piece as you move through '23, how much of that's base pricing and mix and then the opportunity longer term? Yes, it's a great question. So the GRI, as you know, was 6.9%. And with the service rates, we'll keep a decent amount of that. The guide for RPP that we're building in our base case is mid-single digit for RPP, and that is facing 2 headwinds off of that number. You've got product mix and fuel, which each combined about 150 to 200 basis points off of that mid-single digit. So that's how we're thinking about it. And the product mix is really less air, more SurePost, so a shift in the product mix. And then the fuel component, fuel is not going to have a big net impact to the business in 2023. But obviously, there's a cost component versus a revenue component. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. I just want to turn to Healthcare. You're quickly approaching sort of that original target of $10 billion in revenue there. Obviously, investing some more this year in that vertical. Is there a way to think of what kind of outgrowth you're seeing there? Sort of what's the base market case growth for healthcare this year versus what you guys are seeing or growing above? Just any color there. Well, I think Kate is here. And Kate, it would be great if you could just take that question, please. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Allison. So we've really been able to grow healthcare beyond even lapping in the vaccine distribution that we did over $1 billion. And that was because with that service that we're delivering and the capability around the globe, we're actually selling more into biologics and some of the developing treatments. So that continues to fuel us for the future growth. We've seen double-digit growth and we're planning for double-digit growth this year as well with very strong margins. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Knowing that the SMB penetration continues to be an important part of the strategy, just sort of curious in an environment that's tougher, does it get more difficult to penetrate them? And do you find that maybe when you do, they're sort of trading down in services? Just sort of curious, especially given your large customer will continue to sort of shrink over the coming years. Well, we've been investing in the experience because we think that's the way to not only grow, but to keep that very important customer. And I couldn't be more proud of what we -- the team has delivered in this regard. So if you think about customer journeys, if you will, there are 3 really big pain points. One was negotiate value. And that's why we're so thrilled with deal manager because deal manager is a huge home run.  We -- our win rate is 22% higher than we thought it would be with better revenue quality and the customers are happy because they're getting a deal with us within 7 days. It used to take weeks. So negotiated value is an important part of continuing to serve this customer. Another is reroute a package. We had some issues systemically that needed to be addressed, and we fixed that. So now we can reroute a package.  And then finally, resolving a claim. Here, we had a broken link. So when you had a claim, it was not a good experience for our customers. And we've seen our Net Promoter Score in this area alone improve dramatically. And the speed to pay, if a claim needs to pay, has improved by 10 days. So we continue to lean into the experience. And Brian, I know you want to add something here. Thanks, Carol. Yes, I would just follow up and say, we're putting some OpEx investments, $400 million, into the business this year. We invested in a similar capacity in fastest ground ever and SMBs, et cetera, a couple of years ago. And as I think about the SMB journey by investing in those customer experience points Carol was talking about, those investments are paying off. That's what gives us confidence.  We are seeing 40% higher SMBs today than in 2019 when we started that journey in that investment. And we're actually -- we've increased penetration, Carol, for the last 10 consecutive quarters. So it's a bit of a proof point on the SMB front in terms of the investment and the payoff. Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. I guess maybe I had a question on volume. I wanted to understand a little bit better sort of the growth outlook for some of the SMBs, the non sort of Amazon business because it sounds like that's going to be up. So kind of curious about sort of what gives you confidence there, how much market share you've been able to win sort of us around that? And then Brian, a quick point of clarification as well. I think you talked about sort of the first half, second half dynamic of profit being leading to the back half. And then again, in 1Q and 2Q, should we be using sort of similar numbers like 44, 56 somewhere in that ballpark is a reasonable way to think about that first half as well? Maybe on the SMB question, let's look at our Digital Access Program. It's been a huge home run for us. Year-over-year, we saw $1 billion of growth in this program. Here's the important part. It's 3.5 million customers. It's -- these are very small customers who are shipping with us through the platform, and we see continued growth opportunities ahead for us. In fact, we think our DAP program will be over $3 billion in 2023. On the seasonality, yes, so you should consider a similar step-up in mix from a Q1 to Q2 perspective. From a Q1 perspective, Chris, we've got some Q4 trends coming out from a consumer and a macro perspective that are challenged. We're seeing that product mix headwinds, and we're making some of these investments in the early part of the year. So you should apply that same bathtub effect for Q1, Q2. And then Stephen, we have time for one more. Our last question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Just want to come back to pensions real quick. Brian, can you talk about maybe any changes to the sensitivity? It's a little bit different than what we thought, maybe not as big of an impact. Did you change expected returns assumption or anything along those lines? And then maybe if you can just wrap up with a bit of commentary on pricing and yield and productivity and how all those really relate and it can trend throughout the year in an environment where you're seeing volume decelerate? You talked about all the different sort of headwinds or uncertainties, some of which showed up in peak. So really just looking to see if you're seeing some demand destruction out there and if you're able to drive these productivity gains, if the volumes don't necessarily show up where you think they could and surprise a bit to the downside? Happy to, Brian. So on the pension front, look, we've been on a path to derisk the pension. And we actually feel good about the glide path there. We're up in the high 90s, about 98% funded level, which is great for our employees. From a liability perspective, we've taken that down from about $16 billion a couple of years ago to $4 billion, $4.8 billion now. So overall, the glide path has been good.  The challenge we have is that we've seen historic rise in interest rates. And so that $900-plus million number that I gave you below the line, that is a noncash number, but it moves up and down with the market. So we try to give you the transparency. We do tend to look through that as it's a noncash number when we think about our capital allocation vis-à-vis the dividend, et cetera. So net-net, I think we're doing the right thing for the company. Given the volatility in the interest rates, it is a challenging environment and will move up and down on a relative basis. The way I think about productivity, it's a virtuous cycle here at UPS, and I couldn't be more proud of what our team has done quarter after quarter after quarter to drive productivity. And Nando, maybe you could share a few of the action items in 2023 to continue that flywheel. Sure. Just if you look at the shape of the volume, especially in the fourth quarter and quarters before that, we've shown tremendous agility making sure we're matching the hours and the activity in our operations to the actual volume and the revenue. That will continue. And quite frankly, our people are masters of efficiency.  So as we roll out the second iteration of our total service plan, which kicks off on March 3, we're learning a lot about our network. And there's cost to be had in not just on-road activity or inside our facilities, but across the entire network. And we're laser-focused on those initiatives. And whatever volume and how it comes into us in different shapes and sizes, we'll make sure that we're prepared to handle it effectively. And hopefully, we're building up a little bit of a track record to show that, that's exactly what we have been doing. So I appreciate it. Excellent. I want to thank everybody for joining the call this morning. We look forward to talking to you next quarter, and that concludes our call."

Hi, everyone, and thank you all for joining us.   2022 was a challenging year for our business as we continue to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes and increased competition. We've taken action to refocus our investments to support our 3 strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in the future of augmented reality. We are focused on the most important inputs that we can control, delivering engaging experiences to Snapchatters and improving business outcomes for our advertising partners.   We continue to drive strong growth in our community, ending the year at 375 million daily active users in Q4, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Our team continues to innovate rapidly in ways that support the growth of our community. For example, in Q4, we released Communities to expand our content offering, onboarded several new media partners, doubled down on our progress with Spotlight, and launched new Snapchat+ features, each of which helps drive engagement across our service.   For the full year, we generated $4.6 billion of revenue, up 12% year-over-year, and generated $1.3 billion in the quarter or flat year-over-year, reflecting the rapid deceleration in digital advertising growth. Direct response advertising is a critical way that many companies grow their businesses, as it is one of the most performant and measurable forms of advertising. We have made progress updating and improving our ad platform over the past year across 3 key areas: investing in observability and measurement, improving engagement and conversion quality, and increasing the volume of high-quality engagements and conversions.   In the very near term, it will take time for these improvements to translate into improved top line growth. Over the long term, we believe that delivering higher return on advertising spend and utilizing our inventory more efficiently are critical inputs to gaining share of wallet, accelerating revenue growth and realizing the full ARPU potential of our business.  We believe that the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. Over the last decade, we have made significant advances to our AR software and hardware that have enabled the growth of the sophisticated AR platform that we have today. Over 250 million Snapchatters engaged with augmented reality every day on average, and we are investing rapidly and thoughtfully in the future of AR to further expand our leadership position.  We continued our path to sustainable profitability by generating $378 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2022, achieving our third consecutive year of positive adjusted EBITDA. We also generated $55 million of free cash flow in 2022, achieving our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow.  2022 brought significant challenges for our business, and we have emerged with a highly engaged and growing community, a more focused team and cost structure, a clear path to delivering sustained adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow, and a strong balance sheet with $3.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. We begin 2023 focused on executing against our 3 strategic priorities of growing our community and deepening their engagement with our products, accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth and investing in the future of augmented reality. We look forward to sharing more about our progress and plans at our upcoming Investor Day on February 16 at our offices in Santa Monica.   Thank you. And with that, we will begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Clearly, it's a tough environment for the digital economy overall. Can you talk about some of the bigger first quarter revenue headwinds from Snap from a macro perspective? And then can you go into the monetization changes that you are making in the quarter that could have a positive longer impact on the model? Thanks, Justin. It's Evan. From our recent conversations with our partners, it seems like advertising demand hasn't really improved, but it hasn't gotten significantly worse either. I mean, obviously, the brand spend is significantly reduced like we saw in the quarter, but our direct response business continued to grow in Q4. And in general, it seems like our partners are just managing their spend very cautiously so that they can react quickly to any changes in the environment.   I think as we look at Q1, the most significant impact thus far had really been the changes we're making to our ad platform. Maybe just like taking a step back here, we've really been on a journey rearchitecting our ad platform. We shared a lot over the last year about our improvements to observability and measurability of conversion, things like our Conversions API or data clean rooms and multiparty computation. Of course, our pixel implementation for e-commerce advertisers.  I think we have made good progress there. Conversion API adoption continues to grow nicely. And the majority of our revenue is now measured using signals from Conversions API, pixel integration, scan or MMPs. And so a lot of what we've been doing is taking this improved measurability and using it to improve the value of those conversions. And so some of the things we've shipped recently in Q1 at the beginning of the quarter are big changes to our in-app UI, which we believe will help improve consideration because it aligns the ad UI with the more organic content experience.   We've done a lot of work to improve our in-app web view performance, which we believe can help contribute to improved conversions on the platform. We've updated our user ID graph, which helps improve attribution as well. And some of the early results are promising. So for example, pixel advertisers utilizing 1-0 attribution for them. Clicks are 40% more likely to result in a conversion. We're also seeing stuff like higher dwell times, higher nonbounce rates and higher third-party match rates. So overall, obviously, the results are early, but we're excited about these changes we're making.  And then what we're doing is we're taking our machine learning models, and we're training them on these higher-value conversions, which will hopefully help us scale the overall number of those conversions over time. But the net-net, the impact in the short term is really that advertisers are experiencing these higher-value conversions, but there are fewer of them as our models retrain and hopefully, as we progress through the quarter, we can improve and increase that volume overall.   And obviously, in addition to larger advertisers, these changes really benefit smaller advertisers who are much more reliant on last click conversions for measurement, maybe because they haven't implemented our Conversions API or don't have a data clean room, for example. So this, I think, of course, is a near-term headwind to the business, but we're very excited about the long-term potential of these changes, and we're working really hard on it. The next question comes from Mark Shmulik with AllianceBernstein. So it looks like time spent on content globally was off, I think, led by... My apologies, Mark has dropped. The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Evan, I've got a high-level technology question. You guys have been stating forever that you're a camera company, and we've seen an explosion in these new generative AI tools. How do you see those impacting your business? We have examples of Midjourney inside of Discord driving up engagement for them. Do you see the same kind of opportunity inside of Snap? Or do you see -- do you view this as possibly a risk if people are going to the camera less? How do you see this impacting Snap over the next, like, 5 years? Thanks. Yes, we're so excited about the opportunity around generative AI. It's a huge opportunity for us, and we're already investing a ton. A lot of our most sophisticated AR lenses use generative AI technology. And we also see a lot of opportunities just to make our camera more powerful with generative AI. I mean some simple examples are like improving the resolution and clarity of a snap after you capture it or even much more extreme transformations or editing images or snaps based on a text input. But if we think longer term, 5 years, as you mentioned, this is going to be critical to the growth of augmented reality.  So today, if you look at AR, there's just a real limitation on what you can build in AR because there's a limited number of 3D models that have been created by artists. And we can use generative AI to help build more of these 3D models very quickly, which can really unlock the full potential of AR and help people make their imagination real in the world. You can imagine, playing around, your kids wearing AR glasses and pointing, \"Oh my gosh, there's a pirate ship and a big monster\", and we can bring those to life using generative, which I think is really exciting.  And then of course, we're also thinking about how to integrate those tools into Lens Studio. We saw a lot of success integrating Snap ML tools into Lens Studio, and it's really enabled creators to build some incredible things. We now have 300,000 creators who built more than 3 million lenses in Lens Studio. So the democratization of these tools, I think, will also be very powerful. The next question is from Richard Greenfield with LightShed Partners. One, I guess, I want to just follow back on the initial topic of this. DR was up 4% in Q4, which is actually a pretty encouraging number. But your -- it sounds like you're talking about in Q1 based on your guidance, the changes you're making are going to drive that DR to go from -- you know, up 4% to down something. Could you just help us better understand as a DR flywheel and your investments start to kick in, why is it not driving sort of accelerated spend? Why is it actually hurting? I know you heard a little bit about it in the letter, but I think there's a lot of confusion of sort of why that inflection to the negative in DR as you're sort of investing to improve it?  And then just on engagement, you made a comment that global time spent was up on content. Was that true in the U.S.? Or was that more of a global comment? And then on friends' Stories, you said it was down in Q4. Is that TikTok, Reels, Shorts? Just any color on what's driving sort of the pressure on friends' Stories in Q4 would be great. Thanks, Rich. There's a lot in there, so let me see if I can get to all of it. I think at a high level on the DR business, as I mentioned, the key here is that we're really improving the overall value of those conversions. But as a result, the volume of those conversions has decreased as our models relearn on the conversions that we're driving and hopefully, obviously, can expand that volume over time. But it's also requiring advertisers to adapt, for example.  So they need to see that increased volume show up -- that increased value show up in their third-party measurement tools, for example, and then go in and increase their bids to reflect that increased value. And so overall, that sort of disruption. And then again, when you layer in, of course, the changes to the app UI, even things like our sales reorg channel redesign this quarter. It's a lot all at once, but frankly, we'd rather rip the Band-Aid. And so we waited to release a lot of these changes in Q1.  I know Jerry has been eager to make a lot of these changes. But we know that Q4 is critically important for our advertising partners. It's just vital to their businesses. And so we held a lot of those changes to Q1, and we're making them all at once. So they're disruptive, but I think the really exciting thing is that it is having the intended impact in terms of value to advertisers and frankly, the expected impact in terms of the disruption to our business.  So we're going to continue to work through it. But again, the improvements we're seeing in terms of third-party match rates, dwell time, nonbounce rates, that's all really exciting. I think in overall, an input to improving return on advertising spend for our advertising partners.  And then you, I think, asked about content time spend. So I'd say overall, content viewers continue to grow content products, including Spotlight, friends' Stories, creator Stories, partner content. That's true in the U.S. as well, where content viewership is growing. And globally, overall time spent watching content on the platform continues to grow. But time spent watching friends' Stories does continue to be a headwind to total time spent. So if you think about our investments here and what we're doing to reaccelerate time spent with times -- with content, the most important thing is really increasing Spotlight viewership and engagement. We think we've got a lot of headroom here.  We're excited about the 100% year-over-year growth on time spend and 30% year-over-year growth in Spotlight MAU. We're also continuing to invest in new creator tools and growing our creator ecosystem to increase -- create our content supply and diversity. That was definitely a bright spot in the U.S. where time spent watching creator Stories grew 10% year-over-year in Q4. And then we're making a lot of product improvements and innovations around friends' Stories, including things like community stories, which we think are really valuable to our community. And then lastly, obviously, onboarding new media partners who are driving significant viewership and time spend as we shared in the letter.  I do think short video competition is going to continue to be very intense. Our community loves watching entertaining short videos. So what we're really trying to do here is just play to our strengths around our camera and messaging. We benefit from the enormous amount of video creation happening on our platform, over 5 billion snaps created every day, and this network of close friends who really enjoy sharing videos across our platform. So I think we'll continue to play our strengths there. It's part of what's contributing to the great growth we're seeing in Spotlight. The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Just to kind of go back to the ad disruption in the near term kind of laid out on Page 9. I guess one of the questions I have, maybe I'm just not really understanding it. Is the way to think about this, the value of the advertiser is going up because in the near term, you're sort of increasing the effective ad load? So we should think about platform-wide pricing going down in the near term. Is that right? Or am I sort of off there is the first one.  Then the second thing, one of the important aspects of driving direct response business is sort of data capture and being able to build cohorts of users. Can you just talk to us about some of the data capture that you already have and how you think about the potential to sort of cohort these users to drive a large DR business? Brian, it's Derek speaking. I'll take the first one. Just in terms of what we're seeing in terms of inventory and the experience there, what you're effectively seeing is that we've had some growth in impressions just as we've invested in the creator Stories product, in particular, that's been very popular both from a hosting and from an engagement perspective. And so you've seen that contribute. So not necessarily an ad load, it's driven by positive engagement with that product. And then in terms of what we're seeing in sort of the overall ecosystem of the auction, what we're doing here is using our inventory significantly more efficiently. And so that has the effect of actually returning impressions back into the auction, which have to be absorbed across other GDBs and sort of puts downward pressure, all else being equal, on the contestation in the auction.  And so obviously, that increases the opportunity for ROAs and return for advertisers. And all else being equal, what you're seeing that do is translate into lower eCPMs in the short term. But the improvements that we're making to the DR platform translating into longer dwell times, lower bounce rates and some of the metrics that Evan shared with you earlier, really are improving the value of the auctions we're driving and so that is more performative for the advertisers.  So in the very near term, this disruption comes through with the pressure on the supply and the disruption to the volumes that are being driven, but the value is clearly higher, and we can see that already coming through. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context on what's happening in the sort of supply-demand environment there. I'll turn it over to Jerry for the second part of your question. Yes. Thanks, Derek. Brian, thanks for the question. Let me just give you a little about how we think about this data. So we have a bunch of ways that we're collecting data. So conversion API, Pixel, data clean rooms, it's like Evan talked about earlier, multiparty computation, scan and MMP. And all of these signals feed into our system and give us a better view of what's happening with customers and conversions. Add to that, the changes that we made to the web view and to the ad format, so we get better signal about how our customers are interacting with our product. These all come together to train our ML.  And then that gives us better targeting over time. So the way we think about this is sort of a circle where there's constantly information that's coming in, we make changes in each of these products as well as making changes to -- customers make changes to their campaigns, and then we make changes to the ad format. We feed it into the ML, and this sort of circle gives us better and better targeting over time, which we think still leads to better CPMs across the board and better ROAs for our customers. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Okay. I think I'll just ask one question on the monetization of Spotlight. It's something that we've gone back and forth on for a while now. What's the -- I don't want to say what's the holdup in monetizing Spotlight, but I do kind of want to ask that. Like what are the factors that you're looking for that allow you to be a little bit more aggressive in monetizing what's clearly a really strong growth asset for you? I know you don't want to undermine the user experience, but when do you make that on-off decision or that full on decision? Mark, it's Derek speaking. I can take that question for you. I think for context, just to start, and I hinted out this a little earlier in the prior question, we definitely believe that we are demand constrained and not supply constrained at the moment. And to sort of put a finer point on that, we saw 8% impression growth in the most recent quarter, and that translated into a 9% decline in eCPM. So clearly, demand is the sort of lacking portion of things there. And obviously, that's why so much focus is on improvement in the DR business so that we can utilize our inventory and monetize take share. I think we're pleased with what we're seeing also in the growth in supply already. The investments that we made in creator stories in the most recent quarter translated into really solid volumes on posting and that translated into really good engagement. And so that's driven some impression growth in the most recent quarter that we're really pleased about.  In terms of Spotlight though, to answer your question specifically, we did share last quarter that we would be expanding the testing of Spotlight monetization, and we did do that in Q4 and we're pleased with what we saw. It remains really early in that testing. But in the testing we've seen thus far, the yield we're getting on ads served in Spotlight is equal to, and in some cases, higher than the yield we're realizing currently for similar ads elsewhere in the app. So again, this is really early, but that's very encouraging data in terms of what it means for our optimism about the potential for Spotlight to become a really meaningful portion of our overall content business in the future.  So we're going to continue to advance our testing on spotlight in the months ahead and continue to optimize the ad experience for both our community and advertising partners. But as I said earlier, given where demand constrained, the urgency to ramp up monetization there is limited and focusing on the advertiser and the customer experience is the most important thing in the very near term. The next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Maybe if I can pivot to the cost side of the equation and just try to tie a few loose ends together. So it sounds like Evan earlier said, there's obviously some key areas to invest in that will act as a headwind to margins even as you exit '22 and go into '23. You've obviously done a cost-cutting initiative coming out of '22. And then there's elements of the business would improve on the back of the DR initiatives as we move through 2023. Can we get a little more granular on some of the headwinds versus the tailwinds and the cost structure and tying it back to how we should be thinking about leverage in the business when you think about your investment cadence versus sort of implementation of the cost-cutting initiative and then an improved revenue profile as we move through '23? Eric, it's Derek speaking. I can take that one. I think to start off, when we approached the reprioritization that we announced near the end of Q3 where we shared that we were going to be removing $500 million from the cash cost structure, I think it's important to just understand that we were very thoughtful in our approach about that because we really wanted to achieve 2 goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we were clearly building a path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow even at lower growth rates. But we also wanted to make sure that each of our 3 strategic priorities were fully funded so that we were fully funding the efforts to continue to grow our community and deepen engagement, the work that we're doing to improve our DR platform in order to accelerate revenue growth as well as the efforts around diversifying our revenue growth, which you see with Snapchat+, and then also, of course, being able to continue to invest in the long-term AR business.  And so what you can see is we've been able to make sure that we have a cost structure that fully funds those 3 priorities, and we're -- but we're still on track to deliver all of the $500 million in cost reduction. So the first $50 million there is coming out of fixed content reductions, and you should see that fully reflected in the fixed component of the content costs in Q1. And similarly, on the cash operating cost structure, the objective there was to remove $450 million. And we were continuing to wind down various operations through the course of Q4. So you'll see the full benefit of that cost reduction again in Q1 just as we anticipated. For example, our actual headcount numbers are, at the end of the current quarter, are down 20% from the peak in Q2.  So it gives you a sense of the progress we've made in managing down the cost structure and getting ourselves to the prioritized cost structure. So then going forward, first, I'd say like we remain long-term oriented when we're thinking about the investments in the business. So there are going to be things that are incredibly compelling for us to invest in, in the business. And for example, we just made the investment in creator Stories, obviously, a very compelling investment immediately resulting in an 8% increase in inventory.  So there are going to be investments like that along the way that are incredibly compelling. What we have to do is to remain, one, very disciplined on the aggregate cost structure and very focused on prioritizing our investments to make sure that we maintain that path to adjusted EBITDA profitability and consistent free cash flow generation. It's now our third consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA profitability, second consecutive year of positive free cash flow.  And that's important to controlling our financial destiny going forward, making sure that we can fund the investments in the future of our business and also making sure that we have the cash and cash flow to manage any dilution that we experience in the business, which you see we've been active in doing. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of like where we are on the reprioritization of the cost structure and funding our priorities, but also how we're thinking about balancing that discipline going forward. Our next question is from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Two, if I can. First, you've talked a lot about the headwinds to time spent in friends' Stories, but can you just talk about what you're seeing in the core chat experiences? Are you seeing growth in, whether it's time for user or visits per day per user in that core kind of anchor engagement that feeds the whole business?  And then the second one was just in the letter, you mentioned Discover content moving into more places. Curious if you expect this to be more of a driver of engagement or monetization or both. Have you started doing anything that you can kind of share early learnings of this year? Thanks, Lloyd, for the question. Yes. We're incredibly excited about the momentum we're seeing around our messaging service. Visual messaging is really core to the Snapchat experience and what helps people connect with their friends and family and, of course, enhances their relationships. So we're really excited about that momentum there. And of course, the work that we're doing in our camera around augmented reality and helping our community express themselves with AR Lenses and try and get new utility out of augmented reality with things like [ Trion ] as well.  So those core experiences around the camera and messaging are obviously really exciting, driving a lot of growth for us. And also things like the map, for example, as we mentioned, I believe, in the letter, Q4 Snapchatters opened places on the map more than twice as often as they did in Q4 of 2021. So definitely a lot of strong growth and engagement around the core product value of messaging, and we're really optimistic about some of the new products we have coming around that as well. Our last question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. I have two. First, just to circle back on friends' Stories and the strategy there. It sounds like part of the goal here is to get people to shift in to use Spotlight more? Is the idea to shift them into that tab in particular or to put Spotlight videos within friends' Stories? And then can you also just talk about how revenue sharing with creators will work on Spotlight? Yes, sure. So at a high level, what we're seeing with friends' Stories is that people still really want to watch stories from their close friends and their family. It's more the longer tail of their friends where they prefer to watch a really entertaining video than maybe a story about somebody's day-to-day life. And so that's really where we're trying to understand where that sort of breakpoint is for different members of our community and help them discover Spotlight content sort of at that moment as they start to become less engaged with friends' Stories. So some of that, for example, is creating entry points even in Discover, right, so that people can tap directly into Spotlight content from that four-tab content experience.  And in addition, we're also helping drive folks to the Spotlight tab itself, especially. For example, if one of the creators they are following has posted a new Spotlight video, we can let folks know and bring them into spotlight that way. So that's, I think, kind of how we're thinking about driving more top of funnel to spotlight at least in the near term. As it pertains to revenue share with creators, we do, do a small amount of sort of content seating, for example, with sort of contests and things like that around Spotlight, but we have not yet rolled out sort of a large-scale revenue share.  In fact, what we're seeing a lot of creators do is use Spotlight to get distribution for their stories, so to become discovered in spotlight, drive people to subscribe to their creator stories where we then do revenue share with them. And that is actually, I think, quite beneficial both to our business and creators because that subscription model, it provides much more stable revenue for the creators. And I think that's something that they really value compared to Spotlight, which is a bit more hit-driven. So if they've got a great hit video, they can use that to drive people to their story and then monetize that more durably over time and build that relationship with their audience. This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as Snap Inc.'s Fourth quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  Thank you for attending today's session. You may now disconnect."

         "Hello, and welcome to the AMD Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ruth Cotter. Please go ahead, Ruth. Thank you, and welcome to AMD's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-End 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and accompanying slideware. If you've not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of amd.com.   We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press release and slides posted on our website.   Participants in today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Jean Hu, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Devinder Kumar, our Executive Vice President. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.   Before we begin, I would like to note that Mark Papermaster, Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President, Technology and Engineering, will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on Monday, March 6. And our first quarter 2023 quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, March 17.   Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could actually cause the results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.   Now with that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa? Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments about our CFO transition. I'd like to start by thanking Devinder for all of his contributions to AMD over the last 39 years. During his tenure as CFO, we built a strong financial foundation that has enabled AMD's significant growth and success. On a personal note, his partnership and expertise have been invaluable to me. I know I speak for all of AMD when I say we appreciate all he has done for the company and wish him the best in his upcoming retirement.   I also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years of public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to working closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business.   Now turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class growth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments. We also transformed the company. We accelerated our Data Center business and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and Pensando, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model as our Data Center, Embedded product sales grew from $3.9 billion in 2021 to $10.6 billion in 2022.   Looking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded and Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue 44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment revenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.   Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led by increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now power more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others in the quarter.   In Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expanding our pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and aerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest top 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.   To build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in cloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. We are seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and capabilities.   Initial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.   For Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of 40% compared to the prior generation.   Now looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by strong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased with the customer reception of the Pensando technology with good long-term growth opportunities as DPUs become a standard component in the next generation of cloud and enterprise data centers.   Data center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had shipments supporting the build-out of multiple Instinct MI250 accelerator supercomputer wins. In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications in cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering 8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest super computer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023.   Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth quarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased sequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our Ryzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated on-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of AMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.   We also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance than the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks planned to go on sale in February.   Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming graphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon RX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new RDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.  In January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and others that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.  Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number of our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In communications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with Tier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple customers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicle equipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can improve the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.   We also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter, driven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.   Taking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely well, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our business. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and 6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.   In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming businesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with the second half stronger than the first half. In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect to continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.   In our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of our competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and more differentiated set of products to drive future growth.   Over the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry service and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our broad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can address the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.   Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean? Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we generated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying our business portfolio.   Fourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.   Operating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income was $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client operating income.   Now turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors. Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.   Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million a year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.   Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customer product sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue.   Embedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.   Turning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was $443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.  Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.   Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data Center and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022 pro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue.  Operating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion. Net income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior year, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.  Full year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term supply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.   Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and Gaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected to decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers.  In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the macro environment. However, let me provide some color.  Directionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected share gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.   In closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our business. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. We believe our leadership of products, growing customer momentum and strong financial foundation position us well for long-term profitable growth.   With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for a Q&A. session. Thank you, Jean. Operator, if you could poll the audience for questions now, please. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Yes. First of all, congratulations, Jean. And congrats as well to Devinder. I mean the last 5 years of the company have been remarkable, but I remember all the work you and your finance team did 6 or 7 years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement.   My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023. You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the Data Center space and obviously, what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year. Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the Data Center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa 4th Gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well.  When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map. And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning.   As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with Data Center. Also on the Embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so we think that's also a grower for AMD.   On the other side, our Client and Gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory, and I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM.   And then on the Gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so console demand has been actually quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the Data Center and the Embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the Client and Gaming and see how that plays out. I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about gross margin. The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, 3 or 4 points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from Embedded and Data Center. So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue. How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering? Yes. Maybe -- so on the overall margin, the way to think about our business, Matt, is -- and our margin is primarily driven by product mix. So as the Embedded and Data Center businesses are -- grow, so the margin expansion grows with it. In terms of the sequential question that you had from Q4 to Q1, that's just a product of the mix. So with Data Center being lower sequentially, that's that. We are also working through our client inventory clearing. What we're seeing in the PC business is, as we're going through this sort of normalization of inventory, especially on some of the older products, we do have more marketing programs and pricing incentives in place. We do expect that to normalize as we go through the first half of the year. And so as Jean said in the prepared remarks, we would expect margin expansion as we go into the second half with the growth in Data Center, Embedded and some normalization of the client business as well. Your next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Best wishes to Devinder and Jean from my side as well. On the first one, Lisa, I think you mentioned some elevated inventory among your cloud customers. I was hoping you could give us some quantification of how elevated. Is it a 1-quarter issue? Is it a 2-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your January ramp? Because I think coming into this year, the expectations where you could grow server sales by over 20%, do you think that is still a possibility because I imagine you get some benefit from better general pricing. So just puts and takes of how we should think about your Data Center business through this year. Yes, sure, Vivek. So look, we remain very bullish about our Data Center business. I mean I think the feedback that we've gotten on Genoa from our customer set is very strong. And as I said, the important thing is we are expanding workloads.   In terms of where we believe the -- as the inventory normalizes, each customer is different, so they have what they're trying to achieve in terms of inventory levels. Our expectation is that sort of the first half softness for cloud and then second half strength as that's worked through. But like I said, it's different for each customer.   And then in terms of overall growth, as I said, we're very bullish on the overall growth of our Data Center business and the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year. And as we go through the ramp in Genoa, we do have more content with the higher core count that should also help ASPs. Got it. And then on the PC side and also kind of as it relates to the pricing environment, you mentioned the PC TAM is -- could be down about 10%. But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year-on-year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one?  Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering. And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers? Yes. So maybe just to make sure that we're just correlating the numbers. So my comment about PC TAM being down 10% was assuming if you take a look at sort of what IDC just published for 2022 at about 290 million units, and that's more of a sell-through TAM versus a sell-in TAM. So we have been under-shipping sort of the sell-through or consumption for the last 2 quarters in an attempt to renormalize that as soon as possible.   In terms of do I think it's -- I think it's in the ZIP code. I think it's in the ZIP code. So if you imagine 2023 sell-through TAM of about 260 million units, plus or minus, seems to be about the right number. We have made good progress in inventory normalization. We want to be cautious, obviously, heading into the year just given the macro environment. First quarter we said would be roughly seasonal for PCs. I think second quarter -- first quarter should be the bottom for us in PCs. We -- and then grow from there into the second quarter and then into the second half.   And I should note also, Vivek, I mean, we just launched our Ryzen 7000 series with sort of our AI capabilities, both from a notebook and desktop standpoint. So we feel good about the product road map in PCs. Obviously, we have to get through this normalization. Most of the focus is on continuing to differentiate our products and working with our customers to offer sort of very strong platforms. Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. I noted that you said that gross margins would expand in the second half, but you didn't give us any color on how much they might expand. Can you give us any idea like first half to second half? Or I mean just for the full year, do you think gross margins grow year-over-year from the 52% that you printed in 2022? Stacy, this is Jean. Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our Embedded and Data Center segment have strong gross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half.  We continue to have the growth of both Embedded and Data Center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really Client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impact the gross margin in the Client segment.  So going into second half, the normalization of the Client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the Client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good. Once we normalize the Client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand. So I guess I'd ask the question again, for 2023, do you think gross margins can expand over 2022? Maybe what I would say, Stacy, is I think we've given you the puts and takes for where the margin goes. I think it depends a bit on what happens in the macro environment. But we do feel good about second half expansion, and we'll see sort of the relative recovery in macro as it relates to all of our segments. Got it. I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how Data Center and Embedded should be growing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, Client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are under-shipping, it sounds like by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the 4 businesses of the second half versus the first half?  Do you think your Data Center plus Embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first half? Or I mean could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients? Yes. I think the way to think about it is, I think our Data Center grow -- growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly stronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves. I think for the Embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022. What we see right now is a fairly strong backlog and good visibility into the first half of the year. I'm not ready to say that Embedded will grow in the second half versus the first half, though, because we're coming off very strong growth already. And so I think those are the puts and takes. Next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Lisa, the pushback that we often get is AMD is doing really well, gaining share, but you're gaining share in relatively mature markets. And when it comes to AI, you do have a strategy, but you really haven't shown the product set, if you will. You talked about how you have CPU, GPU, FPGA and Pensando, and you're shipping samples of MI300, I guess, later this quarter and potentially launching in the second half. At what point do we, as analysts and investors, start to see your AI strategy materialize in the P&L and your profitability, if you will? Yes. Thanks for the question. We believe that AI is a huge driver of compute growth. And given our portfolio, it should be a driver of our growth as well. I think if you think about the product sets that we are putting sort of AI content in, you should expect MI300, of course, on the GPU training side. We just launched Ryzen AI in our PC portfolio. You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio as well. So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps.  In terms of when -- we've talked before about sort of our Data Center GPU ambitions and the opportunity there, we see it as a large opportunity. As we go into the second half of the year and launch MI300, sort of the first user of MI300 will be the supercomputers or El Capitan, but we're working closely with some large cloud vendors as well to qualify MI300 in AI workloads. And we should expect that to be more of a meaningful contributor in 2024. So lots of focus on just a huge opportunity, lots of investments in software as well to bring the ecosystem with us. That's very helpful. And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the Client business return to first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps  you were over-earning in that business given the environment? Yes. Sure. So I think on the Client segment, it's fair to say that we believe, given where we are with the client inventory levels, the first half will certainly be lower. We expect some improvement in the second half. But in terms of overall margin, we expect that the client business will be below the corporate average, and that's how we're modeling the client business. Next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Yes. I guess the first question is going back to the Data Center piece of the business and specifically around the ramp of Genoa. I'm curious, is there any help that you can provide us with thinking about the ASP uplift you expect to see with the Genoa product cycle? And I guess at some point through 2023, how do we start to think about the Bergamo product cycle as well impacting the server CPU business? Sure. So Aaron, we started shipping Genoa in the third quarter that ramped into the fourth quarter and will continue to ramp through 2024. The way I think about -- or the way you should think about the Genoa ramp is that it is a new platform for our customers. So they'll be introducing it -- introducing first-in-cloud sort of internal workloads and then going to external workloads and then enterprise. So I think it will be throughout 2024. We have -- I'm sorry, throughout 2023.  We do have higher core counts on Genoa. So you would expect that, that will give us some ASP uplift as we go through to some of those higher core count products. Bergamo will launch in the first half of the year. We are on track for the Bergamo launch, and you'll see that become a larger contributor in the second half. So as we think about the Zen 4 ramp and the crossover to our Zen 3 ramp, it should be towards the end of the year, sort of in the fourth quarter, that you would see a crossover of sort of Zen 4 versus Zen 3, if that helps you. Yes, that's very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, the business doesn't really ask that much about, but it's been doing phenomenally well here these last couple of quarters. It's actually the Xilinx business. I know it's within the Embedded largely. But your self reporting, I think if I read the filings correctly, growing 40% plus on a like-for-like basis for Xilinx. I think your competitor also growing a solid pace. How do you think about the sustainability or durability of that demand in that Embedded or Xilinx business as we move through '23? Sure. So Aaron, that business has done very well. So the Xilinx business, I think our overall Embedded business continues to do well. When we look across the subsegments, there are puts and takes in the subsegments. But what we see is content is going up. So we had records in communications, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, automotive. We have the Embedded processor content that's also going into automotive. So we feel very good about that business.  I think as we look into 2023, I mentioned this in the question with Stacy, we have a very good visibility to the first half just given the lead times and the backlog. And the first half looks strong, so we expect to grow sequentially in the first quarter. As we go into the second half of the year, we're monitoring the overall demand environment. And just given how strong it's been, we are looking at whether there'll be some puts and takes in some of the end market segments there. But overall, I think the key point is the content, and our design win momentum is good, and we continue to ramp new design wins in the Xilinx business. Your next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. I wonder if you could talk to us about the puts and takes of PC market share in a down 10% environment. I would assume it helps you with consumers better than commercial, but what is your progress in terms of penetrating the notebook market and penetrating the commercial market where you could continue to gain share? Yes. Joe, we view that the opportunity -- so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now, just given all of the sell-in, sell-through and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we gained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong. As we look at Ryzen 7000 and where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy on PCs. Quite -- a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think is helpful. And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there.  I will say the enterprise work that we're doing on the server side, I think, links very well to the commercial PC work, and we're continuing to invest in sort of the sales and marketing resources to ramp that side of the business. Great. And then going back to the Genoa question that was asked a second ago, as you are in this kind of budget-conscious environment, you're introducing a chip in a system that has pretty high platform cost. Does that slow the adoption at all? It seems like people -- and your competitors are dealing with some of the same issues. Just how does the current environment affect the rate at which Genoa will ramp? Yes. I would say, Joe, the total cost of ownership benefit of Genoa, particularly in some of the larger cloud workloads, is very, very significant. So I wouldn't say that, that's necessarily slowing the pace of adoption. It is a new platform though. So if you think about when we went from Rome to Milan, it was basically similar platforms. So I would say that, that ramp was a bit faster.  But as it relates to Genoa, we had always expected that Milan and Genoa would coexist through 2023. And that we would have -- we still have Milan instances that are just ramping now, and we expect that will continue through 2023. And so I really view this as the natural thing when we introduce Genoa at sort of the higher core count, that both will coexist. And as some of the platform costs come down, you'll see the Genoa cutover, and that's what I mentioned towards the fourth quarter of 2023. Your next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Let me ask a question. And Jean, congrats on the new job. Lisa, I was hoping you could give a little bit of sequential color to just size the magnitude of the 3 segments that are going down in the first quarter and then Embedded going up. And really what I'm getting at there is, in an answer to a prior question, you talked about the mix being a headwind to gross margin. And I think, Jean, you cited Data Center dropping as a percent of the mix. So just trying to get the magnitude of just how much Data Center has to drop to make that outcome on the mix side be true. Sure, Ross. So let's see. We said the Client and Gaming segments would be seasonal. So you would expect that the Data Center would be more than seasonal. So maybe to help you size that, think about the Data Center sequential drop as double digit, whereas the Client and the Gaming segments are more like single digit, if that helps. Yes, it does. And anything similarly on Embedded? Is that kind of up single digits? Yes. Yes. Embedded will grow sequentially single digit. Yes. Got it. Sorry for the nitpicky question. A bigger picture one for you then, Lisa, on competitive intensity. On one hand, I could see that the total cost of ownership benefits of these products, multicore, better performance, et cetera, could lead to higher ASPs, whether you're talking about the Data Center side or your Client business. On the other side, competitive intensity and overall demand is weaker. And at some point, you might even get deflationary costs on the foundry side of things. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment given those somewhat contradictory pressures? Sure. So maybe let me separate Data Center and Client because they're a little bit different. I think on the Data Center side, we would -- we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most important piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of 4th Gen EPYC and sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers.  I think on the Client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing, our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so there are more incentives and more -- a more aggressive pricing environment.  I view that, that's primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products, where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes.  And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see -- expect that to normalize, too, as everyone is sort of optimizing their CapEx spending. Your next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Congrats to Jean on the new seat. Two questions, if I may. First, on the PC side. Can you give us a sense about roughly how far under consumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1?  And Lisa, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client just to grow into second quarter. So does that suggest that 1Q, you think, is the bottom on the PC? And then I had a follow-up. Sure, Mark. So we -- so the first -- the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market -- for our PC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half.  In terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're -- we under-shipped in Q3, we under-shipped in Q4. We will under-ship, to a lesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance of single-digit down. And then we'll be back to a more normal environment.  Now just as a reminder, though, the first half is not usually a -- the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So we would expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter. Got you. Okay. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up, if I may, on the -- China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I guess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out. And could you remind us, to the extent that you can help us understand the risk to the supply side for you in the event that the COVID spreads rapidly as they lift the restrictions and impacts what you have on the supply side there. Sure, Mark. So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have -- we don't believe that we have a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit from a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean we've seen, certainly in our Data Center business, we saw in the second half of the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China Data Center business has been weak for us. If there was a recovery, I think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call. So we put that in the bucket of macro uncertainty, and we'll see how it plays out. Operator, we'll take 2 more questions from 2 callers, please. Certainly. Our next question is coming from Chris Danely from Citi. Great. Congrats on being the first all-female CEO, CFO team. It's a long time coming. So your gross margins held up pretty well for the Q1 guide despite high-margin Data Center business going down. So if the Data Center business remains weak and has a rough quarter in Q2, can we expect a similar gross margin resiliency? Yes, definitely. I think as I said earlier, the major impact on gross margin actually is the PC Client side. The stabilization and the bottoming of Client on the business really help us with the gross margin at the current level. Second half, we should see the expansion of gross margin. Sure. And as my follow-up on your PC Client business, so it had its correction a little bit later than some of the other folks in the semi industry and was obviously a little bit steeper. Can you talk about why that happened and why we should or should not expect that? Or could that happen in the Data Center business as well? I guess Chris, what I would say is I think the PC market has been volatile, and we did significantly -- coming off the pandemic, there was very high demand during the pandemic, and I think we were all adjusting as we're looking at sort of the demand environment post-pandemic and with macro uncertainty. I think the Data Center business, we have again, our -- we're heavily weighted towards cloud, and we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor in the Data Center is our workloads are expanding. And so we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both Milan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so I think that gives us good confidence.  And frankly, the Data Center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment in the first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up production in the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important long-term driver is definitely there. So we feel good about sort of where we're positioned. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Lisa, I had a question on your Client business. I know that your competitor at times uses rebates and subsidies. But the numbers that are in their filings have gotten pretty vague. So I take it from your answer to a prior question that you think that's more on legacy parts. I guess I'm just kind of wondering what changes or impact that's had on your business. And I continue to hear these worries that it's going to have some lasting effect on your share and particularly on your margins. Sure, Tim. So let me make a couple of points. I think all of us, as we participate in the PC industry, there are various parts of the ecosystem that we work with. We work with our OEMs, we work with our retail partners, we work with our distribution and channel partners. And we're all working together to work through sort of the elevated inventory levels. As I said, I think we've made good progress on that. And I think we have much better visibility into the various pieces.  As it relates to the pricing environment, I do believe that the pricing environment is -- particularly when you're clearing older inventory or older-generation products, is a bit more competitive. And we see that. As we look forward, the way we're modeling the Client business is that we are modeling gross margins to be less than corporate average. That's different than our previous modeling.  So previously, Client was more like at corporate average. And I think given the -- I think the nice thing is our business is quite a bit more diversified now. And so with our Data Center, Embedded businesses really being strong growth drivers, I think Client continues to be a good market overall. And as we work through this, we will see some of the normalization that Jean mentioned. And then I guess just as the last thing, you went through some puts and takes on the different pieces for the year, but I just wondered if I could just get you to kind of give a bias for what you think that the revenue for the year is the bias. It sounds to me like the bias is more up than down, but I just wanted to give you a chance to maybe confirm that or not. I think Tim, the answer is yes. But again, let's work through the next couple of quarters. And we feel good about how our products are positioned, and we just need to work through the macro and see how that plays out. Great. Thank you. That concludes today's earnings call. Again, welcome to Jean, and we're delighted to have her on board, and much gratitude to Devinder for his 39 years of service and all his leadership. And we look forward to touching base with all participants throughout the quarter. Thank you. Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."

         "Good morning. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full Year 2020 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team.   During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.   Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website.   With that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. As you can see, we're here in New York City with the whole senior team, and I am very much looking forward to talking about 2022 and a look ahead to what, I think, is going to be an even more exciting future.   2022 was a record year for our company. It was our best year ever. We welcomed more customers to the Un-carrier than ever before in our history, and we translated this customer growth to industry-leading financial growth, finishing with a strong Q4. Our T-Mobile team delivered at or above the high end of our guidance across the board.  2022 was also the biggest investment year in our history. By accelerating these investments, we rewrote the competitive dynamic on network competition for good and laid the foundation for a highly capital-efficient run rate business beginning this year.   When I took responsibility as CEO almost 3 years ago, I spoke to you about an opportunity we saw that if we could execute well, we can position T-Mobile to be the first company in our space to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value, breaking a decades old forced choice on consumers and businesses.  While the results are in, with the latest network awards, and we've done it. T-Mobile is not only the 5G leader, but now the overall network leader, and this opens big growth pathways for our future. Along the way, we successfully completed the Sprint customer migration and network shutdown faster than planned, while also delivering industry-leading growth in both customers and cash flows through our differentiated and profitable growth strategy. And we launched our most ambitious ESG initiatives ever.   Our financial outcomes allowed us to accelerate our network deployments and begin share repurchases earlier than planned. And looking ahead to 2023, we're very confident in our differentiated strategy. In fact, we're on track to meet or exceed all of the aspirations for this year that we shared with you way back at our Analyst Day in early 2021. I'm excited to talk more about all of this today, and let's start with our merger integration.   Back when we closed the merger, few people would have thought that we could shut down the Sprint network faster than planned and deliver the lowest churn in our history at the same time, but that's exactly what our team did. We moved all Sprint customers off the network and completed the decom of Sprint sites, all within 2.5 years.  And not only that, we had our best postpaid phone churn year in the company's history at just 0.88, and we were the only one in the industry to deliver year-over-year improvement for full year 2022.   Diving into network. While T-Mobile has been the clear 5G leader for years, we can now say that T-Mobile has the best overall network in the United States. That is a big statement. For the first time ever, T-Mobile won a clean sweep across every single overall network category in Ookla's recent report.  And recent data from OpenSignal and umlaut also show T-Mobile as the clear leader. With over 12 billion data points across these network coverage and performance tests, the facts show T-Mobile is the new network leader.  And this brings with it an exciting new opportunity. Convincing people that this 30-year forced choice between network and value is gone when you choose T-Mobile. This is no small task, but our results show that more and more people are beginning to notice, and they're choosing T-Mobile.   In fact, our results in '22 demonstrated how differentiated and effective our growth strategy really is. Kind of feels like deja vu. When I think back to this time last year, and everyone was worried about what would happen when industry growth began to normalize. And I sense that's top of mind for everyone again as we enter 2023.  Well, it didn't show up immediately last year. The industry did see lower year-over-year growth in the second half. And guess what? Our unique ability to offer customers both the best network and the best value across multiple new and underpenetrated segments of the market led to T-Mobile's best growth year ever, with 2 of our best quarter since the merger coming in the second half, even as market growth began to normalize.   We posted a record 1.4 million postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry once again. We're winning the highest share of switching decisions in the industry through our core growth strategies. And we delivered our highest-ever postpaid net adds of over 6.4 million, above the high end of our recently raised guidance. This included our highest postpaid phone net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 3.1 million.   We've explained it before. Our strategy is differentiated and durable because it's driven by taking share in places where we're massively underpenetrated relative to the competition and where we now have the winning hand, including T-Mobile for Business, where we just delivered one of our highest ever phone net add quarters in Q4.  And we're clearly having an impact on the incumbents, as you can see in Verizon's highest-ever business churn in 2022. In the top 100 markets for consumer, we're winning with prime network seekers who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs and at a lower cost.  We're only beginning to tap into this new opportunity. And in smaller markets in rural areas, where we're bringing a better value proposition and a better network to new geographies we really didn't play in before, we're capturing a win share of switchers in the high 30s, which says a lot because in many of these places, we're only just getting started.  In addition, we added 2 million high-speed Internet customers in our first full year since our commercial launch. In fact, T-Mobile had more broadband net adds in '22 than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. This is a powerful new phenomenon for our brand, in addition to being a good business.  And not only did we deliver industry-leading customer growth, but our focus on profitable growth translated into industry best financial performance, with core adjusted EBITDA up 12% year-over-year and free cash flow up 36%.   The investments we've made in 2022, including in our cybersecurity capabilities, showed up in a critical way a few weeks ago. I want to take a moment to address the recent cyber incident. After address -- identifying a criminal attempt to access our data through an API, we shut it down within 24 hours. And more importantly, our systems and policies protected the most sensitive kinds of customer data from being accessed.  We take this issue very seriously. While I am disappointed that the criminal actor was able to obtain any customer information, we are confident that our aggressive cybersecurity plan, working with the support of some of the world's experts, will allow us to achieve our goal of becoming second-to-none in this area.   Before I wrap up, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a more connected and sustainable future. Nearly 3 years ago, we launched our digital divide initiative called Project 10Million to bring connectivity to underserved students nationwide with free or highly subsidized service, and I am proud to say we're now more than halfway to achieving our goal. To date, we've provided $4.8 billion in services and connected more than 5.3 million students, and we're not slowing down.  We're also working hard to create a more sustainable future, recently committing to our most ambitious sustainability goal yet to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040. This makes T-Mobile one of the only 4 Fortune 100 companies to do so.  Our work in this space is being recognized, including being named in the top 20 of JUST Capital's 2023 rankings, which measures companies against metrics that matter to our communities, including environmental impact, where we ranked #1 in our industry.   Okay. Let me wrap up with some comments on 2023 and what's ahead. With these record results, we've clearly shown that our differentiated strategy has lots of room to run. And I strongly believe that this will prove to be the case, even as industry as a whole is seeing moderating growth and potentially a challenging macroeconomic environment.  In fact, it may be especially true in that case as our unique high-quality positioning is proving remarkably well suited to the times. We believe 2023 will also be a year in which we begin to see the payoff in terms of EBITDA and massive cash flow expansion, of years of work, on merger integration, synergy attainment and the most ambitious network build in U.S. history, all of which are mostly behind us now, and an ongoing differentiated profitable growth, which is durable results in front of us. I could not be more proud of this team and our employees, and I am so excited for all that's ahead in 2023 and beyond.   Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and our guidance for 2023. Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our 2022 results highlighted our strong execution in accelerating the merger integration, while leveraging our network leadership to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers.  This translated into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 8% in 2022. We delivered core adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 billion, up 12%, and reaching a record high and at the high end of our recently raised guidance. We realized approximately $6 billion of synergies in 2022 or roughly the total run rate synergies expected in our original merger plan in 2018.   Our strong margin expansion also unlocked rapid free cash flow growth, which grew at an industry-best 36% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, and that's even after funding our peak CapEx year in 2022.  This strong financial performance allowed us to commence our share buybacks ahead of our original 2023 time line. We repurchased 16.5 million shares for $2.3 billion in Q4, bringing the cumulative total repurchased to 21.4 million shares for $3 billion in 2022. This is such an exciting start to this opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value.   So let's talk about how our great execution and investments in '22 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2023. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated growth strategy, even while expecting total industry net additions to be down versus 2022.  This guidance assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones. That profitable growth leads to core adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be between $28.7 billion and $29.2 billion, or up 10% at the midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies and above our Analyst Day guidance for 2023. This excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end.   Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to between $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching a full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule.  And thanks to great execution by the teams, we not only delivered accelerated synergies, but now also expect higher run rate synergies of approximately $8 billion in 2024, of which approximately $2 billion is avoided cost, which is consistent with the amount expected at our Analyst Day.  With the major integration work now behind us, we expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes and is expected to be front-end loaded with roughly 40% expected in Q1. This is expected to be the last year of material merger-related costs from a P&L perspective.  And just as we have highlighted at Analyst Day, cash payments related to merger costs have underrun the P&L recognition to date and are expected to invert and be between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023, with almost half of that total heading in Q1.   Net cash provided by operating activities, including these payments for merger-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $17.8 billion to $18.3 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership.  I would expect this to be a bit more weighted towards the first half of the year. Our capital efficience and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network.  Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And this also represents a free cash flow service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers.   Turning now to taxes. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023, as we continuously win and then deepen our account relationships.  Altogether, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities.   And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Moffett with SVB MoffettNathanson. So 2 questions, if I could. One is you've now had a number of announcements about dabbling in the wireline market. I wonder if you could just talk about your wireline ambitions and maybe bridge from that into the role that you think FWA plays in making bundled offers. Is that something that you need to have nationally? And if so, how do you think you get there on the wireline side?  And then second, just a financial question for Peter. I wonder if you could just talk about the pacing of share repurchases. I understand that there's some debt paydown that was always expected to come first. Now that we're sort of well into the repurchase segment, what does the pace of that looks like over the next year or couple of years? Well, I'll start, Craig. Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we view the convergence space. And obviously, to the premise of your question, we are competing very ambitiously in this space with more new broadband net additions in 2022 than the rest of the industry combined. So we're very happy with our position, and it has lots of room to run for years to come.   But on the other hand, the larger question is whether or not we're doing this for offensive reasons or defensive reasons. And our view is that the market has shown that customers will accept bundles, but it's far from certain whether bundles are something that they will require.  And so we're not interested in convergence because we feel like some flank is exposed that we have to protect. We're interested in convergence because we have a lot to offer. And we have a great brand, a great capability, a great team, great distribution and the ability to add value to the space as you're seeing in our present success in home broadband through 5G.  So we're very interested in the space. But I'll tell you, we haven't decided whether or not that would translate into augmenting that strategy with a wireline approach. But if we did, it would be because it's a good business, not because we feel like there's some flank that we have exposed that we need to protect.  And so while we haven't made a decision about it, I can tell you a few things that we've decided not to do, and I think that's important for people to understand. I personally have no interest in having some kind of major change to our strategy as a company or the financial outcomes that will flow from that strategy or the shareholder remuneration that flows from our financial outcomes.  We're on a mission to become the best in the world at wireless, and we're pursuing that mission ambitiously and so far very successfully. That is the place where the future lies and where we want to be. And I'm interested in delivering all of the financial outcomes that we promised you, that flow from that business plan, and the shareholder remuneration and share buybacks that flow from that, and we're not interested in something that would cause a material change in any of that.   Secondly, because of that, I think we've looked at it and said, if we got involved, we would do it most likely with partners. It would make -- it would just be smart to do it with partners versus by ourselves, and that means whether it's purely through a partnership or if we have an ownership stake of some type -- of some kind, it would be off balance sheet and, again, would not be at a level that would have a material change in terms of who we are.  And then finally, as I said, we'd be interested in it if it's something that we could add value and make the market better for customers and make some money doing it directly for the merits of the business, not necessarily for the merits of how it would attribute to wireless.  And that's because consumers are sort of voting with their feet. And so far, we haven't seen a benefit to convergence that really translates into consumer value beyond just a discount. And there are plenty of ways to deliver customers' discounts when you have the superior assets in wireless, superior balance sheet in wireless, the best overall network and a tradition of a brand that delivers outstanding value. So hopefully, that helps clear that one up. Yes. And then on share buybacks, Craig, I think the important thing is that the strategy hasn't changed other than, of course, the ability with the financial performance of the company to initiate those earlier. And so we couldn't have been more excited to get that first $14 billion through Q3 approved, and you saw we delivered $3 billion of that in 2022.  We continue to have line of sight to the up to $60 billion. And so nothing's changed with regards to the strategy. We're very excited about the cash flow generation of the business and the flexibility that, that provides.   If you think about shaping, of course, I'm not going to talk the about day-to-day or week-to-week shaping for natural reasons. But of course, you've got the growth of core EBITDA coming throughout the years, which gives you financial flexibility. As you know, we're very prudent in just the leverage target that we've set overall. But again, nothing has changed with respect to the strategy. Very excited about the free cash flow generation and the shareholder remuneration that affords. Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. I wonder if you can dig into the business growth a little bit. What type of contracts are you signing? Are we -- what's sort of enterprise versus SMB mix? And where do these customers tend to come in on ARPU?  We've heard about some free heavy discounting that you've done to win some big contracts. And as it goes to that, as we think about our POP up 1% this year, should we think of ARPU more like flat? Or does that start to drift a little bit lower year-over-year? We'll start with Callie on what we're seeing and then switch over to Peter on ARPA. Okay. Thanks, Mike. So in T-Mobile for Business, as Mike mentioned earlier, we continue to build very strong momentum, which is driven by our 5G network leadership, combined with award winning customer service model.  In Q4, we continued to grow our service revenue. We delivered one of our highest-ever postpaid phone net add performances. We recorded our lowest postpaid phone churn since the merger with Sprint, and we grew our voice ARPU. In fact, we grew phone net adds every quarter in '22, and it's having an impact, as you can see in Verizon's business trend, which was its highest ever levels in '22. And their business phone net adds declined sequentially for the last 3 quarters. We've also achieved 5 consecutive quarters of business Internet growth.  Some of our key wins in strategic verticals we found in the airline industry, where we've won 9 out of 10 major airlines, growing our base with these customers by over 15% in Q4 alone. In the health care industry, we welcomed to Ensign, who is a nursing company, who's deploying our mobility as a service solution to their 25,000 employees.  In banking, large financial institutions are fast adopting our multiline solutions. We won 2 new logos in Q4 for a total of 24 accounts. In the public sector, we welcomed Chicago PD, Harris County, Dallas ISD.  And even in our Advanced Network Solutions category, we signed on Formula 1, where we'll, for the Las Vegas Grand Prix, be providing powering their operations and ensuring top performance speeds. And we also welcomed Vail Resorts, the largest mountain resort operator, where we're working together to provide innovative guest experiences, helping meet their sustainability goals and enhance resort operations.   And if you want to know why we're winning, it's not a race to the bottom. It's not a bid for the lowest rate or pricing down. We always treat our customers first. And in a modern workplace where CIOs are focused on productivity, digital transformation, these are more considered sales. And therefore, it matters that we have a 2-year head start in 5G network leadership. It matters that we deploy customer-driven coverage, and we're differentiated as a superior network and unparalleled service model.   I'll hand it over to you, Peter. Yes, yes. Let me just add to that. I think what you heard Callie say is we're competing on quality, by and large, and ARPUs are rising. They rose in 2022 in the business space. And to the premise of your question, they're lower than consumer, but they rose in 2022 because CIOs are picking us because we have the best network and the best solutions. And they're interested in what we can bring in 5G that our competitors are behind on. And so that's, I think, very much to the premise of your question.   As we go forward, one of the things to keep in mind is that even though business ARPUs are lower than consumer and always have been, and there's no structural change happening there, these are very good. The cost to sell in that area is lower, longevity, so there's plenty of reasons to like that business that are different from ARPU. That's why you've got to be careful about ARPU as a guiding metric for the profitability of the business because it's not. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And with your question, we're definitely not anticipating ARPU to be down on a year-over-year basis. In fact, I'd say, probably, our guide right now would be generally stable, and that's primarily the mix-driven metric, as we just said, the continued success in T-Mobile for Business, for example, being a mix-driven metric, first responders or segmentation approach.  But there's been just a tremendous amount of tailwind. We continue to see strength in Magenta MAX take rates in Q4. So as you get further into the year, there's potentially opportunity that we could even see some increases over that. But I'd say, right now, generally stable with potential upside later in the year, and we'll see how that develops. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Great. Two quick ones, if I could. First, I guess, following up on the business market question. Could you give some details on the rural market strategy? In the past, you've talked about where you are from a sort of spectrum deployment and distribution standpoint and sort of how well you're doing in terms of penetrating that market.  And then on the CapEx guide, about $9.5 billion, is this a sustainable level? And for Neville maybe, could you give us a sense for sort of what you have in store for the network in '23? Maybe update us on sort of the spectrum deployment at 2.5, what you're thinking for C-band and the other spectrum deployments as we look out to '23 and beyond would be great. Thanks, John. Those are 2 great ones. First, on smaller markets in the rural areas, and I'll hand it to Jon, I am so pleased with what's happening here. We set out to do something we hadn't really done at scale before a couple of years ago, and 2022 was a pivotal year to do all of that at scale.  We moved from 30% to 60% of the marketplaces where we're really competing, what we -- I think we've explained to you before what we call internally license to play or better. And in those places, the numbers have been great.  So maybe, Jon, you can give a little bit of color on how all that's going and maybe even some numbers to back it up, and then we'll switch and talk about what's going on with the network. Yes. Like Mike said, from 30% one year ago to 60% where we'll keep hitting it. Just to remind everybody the size of this market. This is 140 million people across the entire country. It's 50 million households. It's 40% of the U.S. in terms of how we define smaller markets in rural areas, which is everything outside of the top 100 markets.  But this overall business, it's been so fun. My heritage is I started out 25 years ago selling into rural market, bringing cell phone service into rural markets, and it's been so fun to actually bring usable Internet service, whether it be in your home or the mobile service in these rural markets. So it's a very, very fun adventure so far.  And I've got to tell you, our switching is up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And when we look at where we're competing, again, 60% of the markets across all small markets, rural areas, we're on right on the heels of Verizon of taking over the leadership position in share of port ends across the entire market. So it's been a lot of fun.  When we look at what's happening, too, with high-speed Internet, that's a new front-door opportunity for us in smaller markets and rural areas. About 1/3 of our total HSI, high-speed Internet, net adds were coming out of smaller markets and rural areas, and that's been a big catalyst for us in these particular geographies to be that front door in that consideration.  But when you look at -- Mike has been talking about this for a while in terms of not having to make the choice between a great value and a great network, that's never been more important, particularly in these areas that have been underserved for the last 25 years and certainly in the last 10 years from a mobile Internet perspective. So we're having a lot of fun doing it. And to see shares switching well into the 30s, given that a lot of these places, we really just started. I mean, we have less than a year of experience, and that shows that those customers have a resonance with our brands and with our story, and they want in. So we're very pleased with these markets and consumers, and the markets are responding.  Sure thing. Let's go back -- sorry, Jud, the second part of his question was CapEx, the one that [indiscernible] this year. I almost forgot that network. Yes. So let me just stop. [indiscernible] where the answer is yes, $9 billion to $10 billion is our run rate. That was also what are we getting done without lying, '23 and beyond. Thanks for the question, John. We're coming off what has been a historic year for network investment in this company. I mean, we had an accelerated spend in 2022. And you can see in Mike's opening comments the results that are coming from that. Our 5G leadership is just not disputed in the marketplace.  So that's now translating to overall network leadership, which is just tremendous progress for the business and affords us a series of great growth opportunities as John just outlined [ enrollment ] across many other parts of the country, too. So as we look at sustainable level in '23, we're in a great place because we've got the integration effectively complete last year. That was a massive effort, but we're ahead of schedule there. And as we look at the build program on 5G and overall network, we just took great strides.  Today, we announced 265 million people now covered with our ultra capacity footprint in the U.S., and that number will be at 300 million people covered with our ultra capacity footprint by the end of this year. So we continue to expand that great powerful 5G service across the country. 300 million is a number that neither of our major competitors have even considered announcing a target to reach or to achieve.  And in addition to that part of your question, John, we continue to pile in spectrum assets on 5G. I mean, we're a 5G business. We're trying to commit a spectrum, our entire portfolio to 5G as fast as we can. Why? Because it's delivering just a tremendous experience to our customers.  So that spectrum position today, we have 150 megahertz thereabouts dedicated to 5G across our markets. That's, I think, currently more than AT&T and Verizon combined having the 5G space. And that number, we've said, we're targeting 200 megahertz just on mid-band spectrum by the end of this year.  And so we've recently talked about how we're not just deploying 2.5 gigahertz. We're also adding powerful PCS spectrum in the space, that's a big part of the program, as we move through in 2023. You asked about DoD and C-band spectrum. We have some great assets there, probably a 2024 deployment plan for us as the opportunity to leverage and deploy that spectrum cleans up with the FAA, et cetera. But 200 megahertz on mid-band is going to be an industry-leading proposition long before we get to those spectrum assets.  So delighted with the progress. I mean, the 5G network is just unbeatable today across all markets in the U.S. The recent benchmarking clearly demonstrates that. But I think more exciting for the business, and especially for the network team, is this overall network leadership, something that we've been working way on for, as Mike referenced, decades and now is in our hands. So a lot to do. '23 will be a continued busy year for us, but the plan is to extend on network leadership. One of the things you can take away, John, from what Neville just said is that this network leadership story that has emerged has lots of room to run. We said 3 years ago that we had jumped out in front on 5G, and we were at least 2 years ahead of our competitors. And I quoted, in 2 years from now, we'll still be 2 years ahead of our competitors.  And that's exactly what has unfolded. If you listen to Neville's statistics, he told you that we're already, as you know, at 265 million people covered by ultra capacity. Neither of our competitors has stated the goal to be there anytime in the next 2 years. In fact, they've stated to go for the end of next year, 2 years from now, that's less than that.  And yet, we're not stopping there. We're on our way to 300 million people this year. But to me it's -- actually, the more exciting part about the future testing you heard from Neville is going from 130 megahertz deployed of mid-band, 150 overall, 130 in mid-band to 200. That's a massive capacity expansion that's happening because that's not just factors on the experience you get every day.  So far, our medium speeds are 5x faster than just 3 years ago. Our Magenta MAX customers, and you know how popular Magenta MAX is, they're using 30 gigs a month. These are big advantages versus our competition. Home broadband, where we're generating more net adds than the rest of the industry combined, has lots of room to run.  And so -- and that's all on the heels of this massive capacity that's not just in the network, that's still coming, and within the run rate of the $9 billion to $10 billion in capital per year. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Mike, you teed up my question. You said you've got lots of room to run on fixed wireless. Some of the competitors critique the product around limitations on capacity, on speed. So perhaps, now you've got a base of customers, you've seen the behavior over a couple of years now.  What were the learnings? How much market share do you think this product can take? And what's your ability to continue to expand the footprint to continue to expand the capacity of the network? And then maybe just a quick word on macro. You talked about some concerns. Are you seeing anything on payment patterns or any other cautious behavior yet? Great. Well, first on broadband, it's kind of stating the obvious. When somebody who is a fiber provider, so as you know that product is not as good as our product. It's kind of like the people at Ferrari pointing a finger at the world's best-selling car, Toyota saying, \"We're faster. We have the faster car.\" Yes, but Toyota is the world's best-selling car, and that's because -- and if you look in the case of T-Mobile 5G home broadband, because it's perfectly suited to what people want.  And although it has less overall potential for capacity than a strand of fiber, which is patently obvious, it's radically simple. It's low cost. It's transparent. It's portable within tens of millions of households. And it has the speed and capacity that allows people to do what they want.  And therefore, their net promoter scores are some of the highest in the industry, 10 points higher than fiber, 30 points higher than cable. And most of our customers are coming directly from cable, not just from rural areas or unconnected places or DSL.  And so it kind of demonstrates that we've got a product here with the right mix of services to meet people's needs. Lots of room to run. When we launched this product, we talked about 7 million to 8 million homes. And as you can see from our numbers, we're tracking beautifully to that.  And the question now is where do we go from here. And I gave comments before about whether or not we're looking at ways that could augment that strategy. Of course, we are. But that's because we have a winning product and massively expanding capacity to support it.  One of the things to keep in mind is that economically, this unlike fiber and cable, this product so far is not burdened by amortization of capital and the cost structure, right? So we're able to take the capital that we deployed from mobile and find places with excess capacity and market broadband there. And those places are rapidly expanding, even though we have millions of customers on board now soaking some of it up.  We're moving our eligible homes from 40 million to 50 million, and that means that there's 50 million homes out of 140 million nationwide, where if tomorrow morning you applied for service, we'd say yes. And so that is a big footprint. And we think the product is beautifully suited to the times. I can speak to the question on the macro environment. From a consumer perspective, no, we're not seeing it. Of course, this is an area where we're very cautious. But when we think about just Q3 to Q4, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in voluntary churn.  And bad debt was exactly what we laid out in Q2, stable on a percentage of revenue and, in fact, actually lower than AT&T or Verizon on those metrics. So it's something we're looking at and making sure we would closely monitor.  As we said, this could also be a moment of opportunity for us because as a consumer set, to the extent that you're pressured from a recessionary perspective, from an inflationary perspective, it might make you consider a lot of categories of spend and wireless being one of those.  And any time you create the consideration moment, you go look around. And again, this is the time where not only the 5G leadership, but has translated into overall network leadership, coupled with that value proposition just being a fabulous time, and it could be a tailwind for us. So again, looking there and making sure we're cautious, but nothing we're seeing right now gives us cause for concern. We're making sure our company is ready for all scenarios. I mean -- but the fact that we saw bad debt moderate from Q2 when inflation first spiked and surprised consumers last spring, both Q3 and Q4 were lower than Q2. Involuntary churn was actually lower in Q4 than Q3. Our bad debt rates are lower than AT&T or Verizon, showing the quality of our customer base, which has always been a question people had, especially after the Sprint merger.  And so we're side-eyeing the future like everybody else, but we take it as far from a foregone conclusion that very stressful economic times are coming.  We're prepared if they are. We're financially prepared. And as importantly, we're prepared to serve American consumers that, in that situation, may be questioning whether they ought to be having a great network at a better value.  And we're ready to stand up and serve them if they start questioning whether or not they should be saving money in this category because we are uniquely positioned with our high-quality value positioning for economic times like what might be coming. And so we're ready in other case, but the emphatic answer to the question is, no, we are not seeing it.  Yes. So Jud, should we go -- in between here, should we go up to -- you guys can't see this, but we always have screens pointing at us with Twitter questions, and we'd like to open it up. And I was going to have you call out a couple, but there's one that's from [indiscernible]. So there, you win, they win [indiscernible]. But it's actually a really good question. It kind of goes to something we've been talking about, which is what's T-Mobile doing to maintain its industry-leading growth given cable starting to build momentum in the telco space.  And we talked about convergence earlier on. And it's interesting to me that we keep getting this question. We saw cables results coming. I talked about them in Q4. And I would just tell you that it looks to us like cable, who's been in the run rate now for a long time, has had a recent uptick.  It looks to us like you're seeing lots of transference in terms of net adds that add to the category, additional adds being printed, et cetera, for customers, new phone numbers being created, people coming over from prepaid as a dynamic. But what's interesting is you see that recent surge in growth from cable, and this is interesting.  At a time when every 1 of the 3 wireless incumbents experienced better-than-expected churn, so churn was better than expected. For us, it was falling. AT&T was falling in Q4 as well versus a year ago. And at the moment when cable has -- for some -- well, it didn't surprise us, but for some, a surprise uptick in net adds.  And that should kind of tell you a little bit about what's going on. For me, we look at it as sort of as you would expect. Since this is a contact sport, it's sort of us against everybody else, right? And so if I look at the second half of the year, what's interesting is T-Mobile was able to deliver 17% more postpaid phone net additions in the second half of this year versus last year, while the rest of the industry, Verizon, AT&T, Charter and Comcast combined in wireless, delivered 19% less postpaid phone net additions in the second half of this year versus '21.  So in terms of our separation from the market at a time when people ask us about cable, we're doing better and better. Jud, any -- one more on Twitter before we go back. Not yet. Let's go back to the line, and we'll keep watching. Great. Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. You gave really great context on sort of what the market size is for rural and small markets, and the fact that you've moved from 30% of that market to 60%. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more context around the business market in terms of, like, how your market shares have progressed over the course of this year and what you see the size of the overall market being. I mean, one of the things you heard from Callie before is that Q4 was one of the best net add quarters ever in our history. So we're really comfortable with where this is -- how this is shaping up. And one of the reasons for that is there are long sales cycles in this market. And we've been at this 5G story longer than anybody else.  CIOs are very interested in more strategic engagements than they were interested in a couple of years ago. And now we're in those conversations, but we're way down the pike in them. So we're very comfortable with where we are. We're competing extraordinarily well. And to your market share question, we're very much on track for the Analyst Day aspirations that we shared with you. Mike, can you give us the mix of business in fixed wireless broadband? . You mean should I disclose that right now as a new fact? Actually, I don't think we did. I'm kidding, but I don't think we did. We haven't. I think what we've said is it continues to be the majority from consumer, but you're seeing continued uptick in the business side, as just Callie mentioned in growth there. So we see a lot of room to run on the business side as well and, obviously, continued room in the consumer space. I did see some notes on that. They kind of got it wrong. It said maybe business is what's surging in that area. The business is doing well, but it's the overwhelming majority for us is consumer in that space, yes. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. So you've been able to sustain very strong postpaid phone net adds throughout the merger integration, despite those results being burdened by elevated churn related to those integration activities at certain points in time. And I know it sounds like -- it seems like a lot of that is behind you, but I'm curious how you think about the levers to drive churn lower from here.  I'm wondering if there's actually any residual benefits from the integration we haven't seen yet. I don't know how important the remaining billing migration maybe to churn. And maybe just at a higher level, what type of churn outlook is embedded in your postpaid phone -- your postpaid net add estimates for this year? Yes. First of all, yes, on integration, there's more room to run. But principally, I think most of the room to run comes from value, network, service, brand. And look, we've been through this journey. We drove the Magenta brand to the best churning brand in this industry. And I certainly won't be satisfied until T-Mobile blended postpaid is the best churning brand in this industry.  And that shows you we've got some room to run because while we're the most improved, we have a great price, we're not the best yet. And so that's where we're going. That's the goal. And it is, of course, there's some room to run on integration. But we're not separating it for you anymore because it's very hard to chop up at this point.  All the customers are on the destination network. Some of them are on the destination biller. It's not that determinative anymore as to which biller you have because we try to make that biller sort of very opaque to you and not transparent. You're called T-Mobile in many cases. So it's  just hard to chop it up now.  But yes, there's still room to run to get people settled into fantastic rate plans, both on their device as well as on their service, and to feel very cared for with clear transparent services. But I'd say the bigger opportunity is our worst to first game plan that we know how to execute, which is give people a great deal, give them Un-carrier moves that allow them to voice that deal and express it and advocate for T-Mobile.  Give them the best network, bar none. Give them a fantastic path to great devices. Give them a brand that's famous for caring for them and the best customer service in the industry. That's why our net promoter scores are the highest in the industry, and I expect that to translate to the lowest churn by the time we're done. If you don't mind, if I could ask a churn follow-up question. Where are you in understanding the churn profile of your fixed wireless base, either just as a standalone broadband customer or perhaps the impact it has on your mobile churn to the extent it's bundled? We're really happy with it. What we do with any business is we age it into cohorts and look at it sort of based on people that have been with us 1.5 years, people that have just been with us a few weeks. And what you see is what you -- exactly what you would expect, which is the more aged cohorts are settling into a beautiful pattern.  We have the youngest broadband base in the industry because we went from nothing to 2.5 million subscribers all in the last few months. And so we have to really break it down to understand it. And when we do, we're very pleased.  And one of the things that happens as a dynamic on this business is that the barriers to trial, therefore, the cost to us of encouraging that trial are totally different than wireline.  We're not sending some truck to your house to dig ditches or drill holes in the side of your house and all kinds of cost. We're letting you take home a modem and router and give it a shot. And if you love it, you wind up sticking with it. And if not, there's sort of a no harm, no foul relationship. Let's try it again in a year. That wasn't perfect for you right now because we're pouring capacity into this network.  And as long as we treat customers really well, and they gave this a shot, and we were transparent with them that -- as to whether or not it would work, the vast majority keep it. But a small portion of people that don't doesn't really wind up costing us anything. So the dynamics of early churn in a business like this are totally different than traditional broadband is one of the things that makes it a better business model. Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. So I guess, the first question would be for Peter. If you could kind of step us through the guidance and the changes from the Analyst Day outlook from $28 billion to $29 billion, what's changed to move your midpoint expectations up? And then from the free cash flow original guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion, what's moved your midpoint down? And what are the moving parts in between those 2 things?  And the second question would be, Mike, what would be your appetite to proactively reach out to SoftBank within the confines of the stock buyback program and clean up this 48.8 million share issue that seems to be keeping for whatever reasons, and I understand the lockup and everything. But it seems to be keeping T-Mobile stock from going north of $150. Is there an appetite to just get rid of that and just make sure that, that's not a headwind for the stock on a go-forward basis? Those are both great questions, Dave. Let's start with EBITDA and cash flow, as you could just eliminate all the headwinds and tailwinds since the early 2021 kind of give us a high level. Yes. But we're the only one still talking about our 2021 guidance. And we're talking about pulling into the stations feeding it. And that should say a lot about our business plan and the integrity of it. But it is actually quite different than what we were expecting in terms of some of the shaping of it inside.  Peter, maybe you can give some color. Absolutely. When I just think, Dave, back to Analyst Day and what's happened since then, you've certainly seen a tremendous amount of incremental profitable growth than what we see. And then you saw the ARPA trajectory grow, you've seen high-speed Internet and the tremendous growth that we've had there and the ability to accelerate synergies.  On the flip side, of course, the world has changed a lot since then, and inflation is one of the elements that's impacted a lot of companies. For us, we've been a lot more insulated than others, and we've talked before around why that is with our ability, early on after the merger, to walk down major categories of costs during a time when the negotiation looks a lot different in low interest rate environments and low inflation rate environment.  So there's a lot of the kind of puts and takes and why you see us now being able and confident to express a guide that's actually above Analyst Day.  When I think about just the shaping of the core EBITDA, throughout the course of the year, what you're going to have, of course, is continued profitable growth and continued synergy unlock. And one of the things that's assumed in the core EBITDA guide is the wireline sale close somewhere around midyear, and that's a little bit of a drag on core EBITDA. So as I think about like Q1 probably in the approximately [ 6.9 ] range and then continue to unlock throughout the course of the year on core EBITDA.  And then how I think about from there to free cash flow, really, free cash flow in 2023 has a few onetime items that you need to consider. And first and foremost is we're actually now in '23 achieving what we've been talking about for a long time now, which is the highest conversion of service revenue to free cash flow in the industry, despite these kind of few onetime things that I'll highlight.  One is merger-related expenses, and I spoke in the prepared remarks around $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And that's a little bit higher than we assumed at Analyst Day in terms of total merger-related expenses by about $400 million, and that gives you now an incremental unlock up to $8 billion in total run rate synergies. So that's one.  The other is the '21 cyber event. And remember, you saw us take a lot of the expense-related charges in 2022, but we anticipate the cash flow associated with the class action settlement to outflow in '23.  And then the last again is related to wireline, where, as you recall, we have an IP-related take-or-pay agreement. The first year after close is $350 million and then tapers down significantly from there. And so we're assuming about half of that flowing into '23. So that's how you kind of take core EBITDA down to free cash flow guide. And hopefully, that answered almost all the puts and takes. Yes. I just love the question, by the way, Dave, because our guide on cash flow for next year is to have 75% year-on-year growth. And you're like, right. We have just a little more respect. And the answer is I hope so. Let's see what happens.  So -- and you had a second question about SoftBank. We -- obviously, we know the SoftBank guys very well. We talk a lot. We're in constant communication. But I wouldn't say there's a deal imminent, and there's a reason for that, which is people on both sides of a potential transaction believe that we're moving past [ 1 50 ] anyway. And so they don't have a lot of incentive to give us a deal or a discount because they think they're getting this event.  We've always planned for it. We've always believed -- the average analyst's target is [ 1 70 ] on this business. If you look at our rapidly expanding cash flow profile and the durability of our growth strategy, we think this event is probably coming.  So it doesn't feel like -- it feels like, for us, we would want to discount it. We were going to take that out, and they look at it and say, \"Yes, but why would I give you a discount?\" And so there's -- that's a little bit of color on it. So I wouldn't say a transaction is imminent, but I wouldn't say it's impossible either.  I think the operator cut you off. But yes, we know and thank you for that. It's awesome. Great.  And so looking over -- if we look at the Twitter, Bill Hull always has some great questions. T-Mobile, Jon Freier, Mike Katz, state of prepaid for T-Mobile, competitors, including MVNOs. And T-Mobile was the only net positive on prepaid. Others had losses. What's going on with prepaid? And also what's going on with the MVNO market?  Since it includes the MVNO market, I'll actually switch to Mike Katz. You can tell us a little bit about what's happening on prepaid. Yes. Like Mike said, we're really excited about what happened in prepaid. We were the only one with positive gains. And I think, most importantly, we have and continue to have the #1 brand in prepaid with Metro. And we see the Metro growth being a big tailwind for us.  We also have a really healthy and robust MVNO set of partnerships, including big exclusive partners that also had significant growth over the course of '22 and in Q4. And we've got a diverse set of partners that both focus in unique distribution that we don't always fully reach with the T-Mobile brand and unique segments that also sometimes are underrepresented with the T-Mobile brand. So we feel really good about the portfolio of products and brands that are reaching the prepaid market. I find it particularly gratifying that in an environment where there's lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid going on, and which has lasted longer than most people predicted it would last.  Our prepaid brand continues to be the strongest in the market and the only one that grew this quarter. That's fantastic because you have seen lots of momentum across the industry from prepaid to postpaid. Because of the economic times, people are qualifying for postpaid and continue to do so for -- to the premise of the earlier question about what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. And yet our prepaid brand remains this strong.  The lowest churn ever in our history on prepaid and the lowest in the industry was in 2022. And so this is a business where -- that has a great bond with its customers. They stick with it for a long time. They love Metro by T-Mobile, and it's a real source of strength.  Cool. Jud, is that -- does that take us to the end of the program? It does. We can probably take one more question and then we got to hop it up. So operator, one more and then we got a call it a day. So our next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. A question on postpaid phone ARPU. For many years, your ARPU model was flat to down annually, and 2022 is a fantastic year for ARPU, thanks in part to MAX. MAX sell-in still sounds really steady for '23. And so thinking about your outlook for flattish, I'm just wondering why we might not expect to see more growth in ARPU and maybe even a similar year to 2022 in '23. A part of it is because it's early in the year, and it's not that clear where the dynamics of competition will be. If you look back to our multiyear Analyst Day targets, we actually thought back then, back to all the puts and takes, and Peter just kind of talked about this, that there would be much more going on, on sort of the service revenue ARPU side. And we didn't anticipate as much as what wound up happening on the device side.  And so we guided accordingly on service revenues and ARPU where we achieved the '23 service revenues last year, and ARPU growth was a big reason for that. But we had unexpected costs on the device side because the factors of competition sort of shifted.  So it's a little early to comment on ARPU. We do know that if there's an opportunity for growth versus just generally stable, it would be more in the second half than the first half, and there's lots of reasons for that. But we really like where this is.  The underlying dynamics on Magenta MAX are stronger. They're not moderating. They are stronger than they've ever been. But on the other hand, we're finding success with military, with seniors, with business and other things that could be dilutive to ARPU, but are fantastic on a CLV basis. And that's why we have to be careful about not getting people too hooked into ARPU.  ARPA, we're guiding for growth because we see lots of opportunity for customers to continue to double down on their relationships with us across the board, including new device types and including home and business broadband. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes on kind of why it unfolded the way it unfolded. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Again, I look forward to catching up with you again soon. If you have any other questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations and Media Relations team, and have a great day. Thanks, everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day."

         "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific 2022 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. My name is Breika, and I will be your event specialist running today's call. [Operator Instructions]  I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Rafael Tejada, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Tejada, you may begin your call. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading News & Events until February 17, 2023. A copy of the press release of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.  So before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are on file with the SEC and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials, SEC Filings.  While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.  Also during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financials.  So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc. Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call and a wrap-up of a truly exceptional year for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results in Q4. And as I reflect on the year, three things stand out to me.  Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our customers. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals.  Our ability to deliver these results in a year that included global supply chain disruptions, a war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and inflationary headwinds wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our team around the world. I'm very grateful for our team's great execution in effectively navigating dynamic times and enabling the success of our company and our customers. Thanks to our colleagues, our company delivered a spectacular 2022. And I couldn't be more excited for 2023.  I'll get into more of the details in my remarks later. But first, let me recap the financials. Starting with the quarter, our revenue grew 7% to $11.45 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.56 billion. And we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving $5.40 per share.  Turning to our results for the full year. We grew revenue by 15% to $44.92 billion in 2022. Adjusted operating income was $10.99 billion and adjusted EPS, $23.24 per share. Let me turn to our end markets. We continued to deliver excellent and differentiated performance in Q4. This was driven by a continuation of good market conditions and outstanding execution from our global team, resulting in meaningful share gain.  Let me now give you some color for the quarter and the year. Starting with our largest end market, pharma and biotech. We continued to deliver impressive performance with growth in the low-teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status with our pharma and biotech customers. Throughout the year, we had broad-based strength across our businesses serving this end market, highlighted by our bioproduction, pharma services, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses as well as the research and safety market channel.  In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. We delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including biosciences, electron microscopy, chromatography and mass spectrometry as well as in the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low-teens for the quarter and mid-teens for the full year. During the year, we delivered strong growth in our electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses.  And finally, in diagnostics and health care. In Q4, revenue was approximately 40% lower than the prior year quarter and 25% lower than full year 2021. The team delivered good core business growth during the year, led by our microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses as well as our health care market channel.  I'll now turn to our growth strategy, which is delivering differentiated performance and setting us up for an even brighter future. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.  Starting with the first pillar. It was another terrific year of high-impact innovation as we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthen our industry leadership by enabling our customers to break new ground in their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, our innovations are accelerating our customers' research and unlocking deeper analytical insights.  In 2022, we extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics, metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600 Series Gas Chromatograph to advance analytical testing for food, environmental, industrial and pharmaceutical applications.  In electron microscopy, the new Thermo Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM was launched during the fourth quarter. It will help our customers accelerate structure-based drug discovery for debilitating disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as research for cancer and gene mutations.  We also continue to build on our genetic sciences capabilities to help our customers understand, diagnose and treat disease. During the fourth quarter, our SeCore CDx HLA Sequencing System was granted marketing authorization by the U.S. FDA for use as a companion diagnostic with a T cell receptor therapy for adults with ocular melanoma.  This is a really nice example of how our Specialty Diagnostics business is benefiting from our capabilities in Life Sciences Solutions. In addition, we expanded our PCR test menu to leverage our incredibly large installed base of instruments and launched the TrueMark Infectious Disease Research Panels for rapid detection and research of infectious disease pathogens.  To wrap up the innovation highlights, we added to our cell and gene therapy offering, most recently launching the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation System. Our solutions are helping customers advance their cell and gene therapy programs. So another spectacular year of innovation. And we have an exciting pipeline of launches in 2023 and beyond.  The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to create a differentiated experience for our customers. We continued to strengthen our capabilities serving these markets during the year. And I'll highlight a recent example. In the quarter, we opened a new cGMP biologics and sterile manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides integrated clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product capabilities to help customers in China and in the Asia-Pacific region deliver patient therapies more quickly.  Turning to the third pillar of our growth strategy. We continue to enhance our customer value proposition by strengthening our capabilities. We've been executing on the significant investments we've made over the past couple of years. And throughout 2022, we brought new capacity and capabilities online for pharma services, bioproduction and clinical research services. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab in Richmond, Virginia to support our clinical research business and the increasing demand for our laboratory services to accelerate drug development.  As always, our PPI Business System enabled our success during the year. It's helping us to drive meaningful share gain, maximize the return on investments, meet our customers' needs and successfully navigate a dynamic environment, including effectively addressing inflation and global supply chain challenges. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day and enables outstanding execution.  We continue to successfully execute our capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and return of capital to our shareholders. In 2022, we successfully integrated PPD, our clinical research business. For the full year, PPD delivered core organic growth in the high-teens, generating over $7 billion in revenue and contributing over $2 to our adjusted earnings per share.  The combination of a great per share performance and excellent progress on our synergy realization is delivering very strong returns for our shareholders that is well ahead of the deal model. From a customer lens, the acquisition has further elevated our trusted partner status as customers are realizing significant value in partnering with our team to advance a scientific idea to an approved medicine.  In 2022, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. And on the first business day of 2023, we completed the acquisition of The Binding Site, a leading specialty diagnostics company. The Binding Site is an exciting addition and highly complementary to our Specialty Diagnostic business. Together, we'll be able to advance the diagnosis and management of patients afflicted with multiple myeloma and immune disorders.  Reflecting on our progress of our ESG priorities in 2022, we further advanced our environmental and philanthropic efforts while also continuing to strengthen our company culture. During the year, we continued to advance our environmental sustainability road map, reducing our carbon emissions and finalizing significant power purchasing agreements to accelerate our transition towards 100% renewable energy. Looking forward, we've also increased our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target to achieve a 50% reduction in this decade.  Through our Foundation for Science, we continued to advance our philanthropic efforts and supported students across the globe during the year with our STEM education programs. This included an announcement in the quarter for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge, the premier middle school STEM competition in the U.S.  And throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was recognized for its industry leadership and inclusive culture. This includes earning 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign 2022 Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year as well as inclusion on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. In the quarter, we were recognized by Forbes Magazine as one of the World's Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America's Best Employers For Veterans. As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. 2022 is a special year for Thermo Fisher. And I'm excited about 2023 and beyond.  Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance. But let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating 2023 revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70 per share. This very strong financial outlook reflects a continuation of our track record of delivering excellent financial performance and sustainable value creation for all of our stakeholders.  So to summarize our key takeaways for 2022. Our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain. Our differentiated customer value proposition is further elevating our trusted partner status. And this, in combination with the power of our PPI Business System, drove outstanding financial performance for the quarter and full year, exceeding our ambitious goals while navigating a very dynamic macro environment. And we enter 2023 with strong momentum, and we're incredibly well positioned beyond 2023.  With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen? Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release, in Q4, we delivered an outstanding quarter, capping off another excellent year.  For the quarter and the full year, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth. This differentiated level of performance demonstrates the power of our growth strategy and the trusted partner status that we've earned with our customers. In addition, in Q4, we generated $370 million of COVID-19 testing revenue, $3.1 billion for the full year.  Taking a step back and thinking about the top line performance for the year, I'm really proud of what the team delivered. We offset $4.2 billion less testing revenue, which was a headwind of over 10%, and still delivered slightly positive organic growth for the year. That's a great accomplishment.  Then using the power of the PPI Business System, we were able to translate the top line strength to excellent adjusted EPS and cash flow results. In Q4, we delivered $0.23 more adjusted EPS than our prior guide, ending the year at $23.24 and delivered $6.94 billion of free cash flow, all while continuing to invest in the business to enable an even brighter future. So 2022 was another excellent year.  Let me now provide you with some details on our performance. Beginning with the earnings results. As I mentioned, we delivered $5.40 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $23.24 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.01 and $17.63 for the full year.  On the top line, as I mentioned, in Q4, we delivered 14% core organic revenue growth of $370 million of testing revenue. Reported revenue grew 7% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 reported revenue increase included 3% lower organic revenue, a 14% contribution from acquisitions and a headwind of 4% from foreign exchange. The full year core organic revenue growth was 14%. And we delivered $3.1 billion in testing revenue. For the full year 2022, reported revenue increased 15%. This includes slightly positive organic growth, an 18% contribution from acquisitions and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange.  Turn to our organic revenue performance by geography. The organic growth rates by region are skewed by the COVID-19 testing revenue in 2022 and the prior year. In Q4, North America grew in the low single digits; Europe declined in the low-teens; Asia Pacific in the mid-single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits; and the rest of the world declined high single digits.  For the full year, North America grew in the low single digits; Europe declined high single digits; Asia Pacific grew high single digits, including China, which also grew high single digits for the year; and the rest of the world declined high single digits. On a core organic growth basis, all regions had strong growth in 2022.  With respect to our operational performance, adjusted operating income in the quarter decreased 19% and adjusted operating margin was 22.4%, 710 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 24.5%, which is 650 basis points lower than 2021.  For both the fourth quarter and full year, we achieved strong price realization to effectively address inflation while also delivering strong productivity. This was more than offset by lower testing volumes, continued strategic investments and the expected impact of incorporating PPD into our financials. For 2022, full year adjusted operating margin was 40 basis points lower than assumed in the prior guidance. 2/3 of this was due to business and currency mix and 1/3 due to one-time costs related to the runoff of testing revenue.  Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.4%, 910 basis points lower than Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.5%, down 810 basis points versus the prior year. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, the change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin.  Moving on to the details of the P&L. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.6% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points versus Q4 2021. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.8% of revenue, an improvement of 130 basis points compared to 2021. Total R&D expense was $390 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.5 billion, representing 5% growth over the prior year, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 7% in Q4, 6.4% for the full year.  Looking at results below the line for the quarter. Our net interest expense was $119 million, which is $31 million favorable to Q4 last year. Net interest expense for the full year was $454 million, a decrease of $39 million from 2021. Adjusted other income expenses was a net expense in the quarter of $10 million compared to net income of $7 million in Q4 2021. The year-over-year variance is primarily due to changes in nonoperating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net income of $14 million, which is $24 million lower than the prior year.  Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, which is 100 basis points lower than Q4 last year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 13% or 160 basis points lower than 2021. We repurchased $1 billion of shares in Q4, bringing our total repurchases for 2022 to $3 billion. Average diluted shares were 393 million in Q4, approximately 4 million lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases net of option dilution.  Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $9.15 billion. Free cash flow for the year was $6.94 billion after investing $2.2 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $118 million to shareholders through dividends in the quarter and $455 million for the full year. We ended the quarter with $8.5 billion in cash and $34.5 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.2x on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 13.5%, reflecting the strong returns on investment that we're generating across the company.  Now I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our COVID-19 testing revenue varied by segment. And the testing revenue was significantly higher in the prior year. So that does skew some of the reported segment margins. We're executing strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation. And we're referring to the acquired PPD business as our clinical research business. And that resides in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. The anniversary date of the acquisition was December 8.  Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions. Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 27% and organic revenue was 24% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we delivered very strong growth in our bioproduction business. This was more than offset by the moderation in testing revenue in the segment versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment declined 13% and organic revenue declined 12%.  Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions decreased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 34.1%, down 14 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. In Q4, we had unfavorable volume mix due to the significantly higher testing revenue in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 29% and adjusted operating margin was 41.2%, a decrease of 880 basis points versus 2021.  In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 9% in Q4 and organic growth was 14%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by electron microscopy and the chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 9% and organic revenue increased 14%.  Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 25% and adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong volume pull-through and productivity. This was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 26% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 310 basis points versus 2021.  Turning to our Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue declined 23% and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by our health care market channels and our transplant diagnostics and microbiology businesses. This was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year-ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment decreased 16% and organic revenue was 13% lower than 2021.  Q4 adjusted operating income decreased 30% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, down 190 basis points versus Q4 2021. During the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which was more than offset by the impact of lower testing volume. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, down 110 basis points versus 2021.  And finally, in Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment. Q4 reported revenue increased 42%, organic growth was 11% and the impact of acquisitions was 35%. During Q4, organic revenue growth in this segment was led by the Pharma Services business. PPD, our clinical research business, continued to perform very well. And during the quarter, it delivered over 20% core organic revenue growth and contributed $1.9 billion of revenue to the segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 51% and organic revenue increased 10%.  Q4 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 73% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, which is 260 basis points higher than Q4 2021. In the quarter, we drove favorable business mix and delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through that was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 56% and adjusted operating margin was 12.8%, up 40 basis points versus 2021.  Let me now turn to our 2023 guidance. As Marc outlined, we're starting the year with a very strong financial outlook, consisting of revenue guidance of $45.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $23.70. Let me provide some details of the underlying assumptions, starting with revenue. Our initial guidance for 2023 assumes 7% core organic revenue growth, $400 million in testing revenue, $250 million of revenue from acquisitions and a tailwind of $100 million from FX. This all assumes a return to more normal market growth conditions in 2023 in the range of 4% to 6%.  Within our core revenue, we expect $500 million of vaccines and therapies revenue in 2023. This is $1.2 billion less than 2022, a 3% impact on core organic growth. Even with this headwind, we are expecting to deliver 7% core organic revenue growth in 2023, demonstrating the strength of our initial outlook, the agility with which we're managing the business and the ongoing benefits of our growth strategy.  Turning to profitability. In 2023, we're assuming an adjusted operating margin of 23.9%. This is 60 basis points lower than 2022, driven by 2 elements: a 40 basis points of core margin expansion; and 100 basis point headwind from the runoff of testing revenue. The year-over-year margin change is consistent with the comments I made on the last earnings call, when I described how to model the margin impact to the different elements of the year-over-year change in revenue. In 2023, with the pandemic-related testing revenue behind us, I thought this would be a good opportunity to take a step back and take a multiyear view on our meaningful margin expansion progression. During -- starting in 2019 pre pandemic, excluding the impact of PPD, we're on track to expand operating margins 60 basis points a year on average through 2023, a 250 basis point improvement over the 4-year period. So great progress on margin expansion. Turning to adjusted EPS. We expect to deliver $23.70 in 2023. This is a 2% year-over-year increase, consisting of a 10% headwind from testing, more than offset by a 12% increase driven by the core business. We're actively managing the whole P&L to effectively deal with the material runoff in testing and vaccines and therapies revenue and still grow our adjusted earnings per share for the year. This shows the strength of our growth strategy and the power of our PPI Business System. Moving on to some more detailed assumptions behind the guide. With regards to FX, in 2023, we're assuming there's a year-over-year tailwind of approximately $100 million of revenue, or 0.2%, and $0.04 of adjusted EPS, also 0.2%. We're assuming that The Binding Site acquisition will contribute approximately $250 million to our reported revenue growth and $0.07 to adjusted EPS in 2023. Below the line, we expect net interest expense in 2023 to be approximately $480 million. This is approximately $25 million higher than 2022 and includes the funding for The Binding Site acquisition. We assume that the adjusted income tax rate will be 11% in 2023. The improvement from 2022 is driven by a tax planning initiative. We're expecting net capital expenditures will be approximately $2 billion in 2023 and free cash flow is assumed to be $6.9 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which were already completed in January. We estimate the full year average diluted share count of approximately 388 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $540 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And as is our normal convention, our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures. And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. Revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS are all expected to ramp up as we go through the year. This is due to several factors. Core organic revenue growth is expected to increase as we go through the year, largely due to the comps related to vaccines and therapies as well as the expected phasing of economic activity in China. The impact of the runoff in testing revenue is most pronounced in Q1. And the benefits of the offsetting cost actions are spread over the year. From a foreign exchange standpoint, while a slight tailwind for the year as a whole, in Q1, FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of approximately $200 million of revenue and $80 million of adjusted operating income. Below the line, net interest expense is expected to decrease during the year as we generate free cash flow and earn interest on that cash build. Putting all this together, for Q1, we expect core organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, adjusted operating margin to be slightly lower than Q4 2022 and adjusted EPS to be just over 20% of the full year total. So to wrap up, we had an excellent 2022, and we're really well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for all our stakeholders in 2023. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf. Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have from the phone lines comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. I wanted to start with the clinical research, PPD, performance. So high-teens for the year, that's well above what we're seeing from the peer group. So a three-parter for you, Marc. What was your book-to-bill in 2022? Two, how are the revenue synergies tracking? And then three, can you talk about what sort of growth you're assuming for this business in 2023? Sure. So Jack, thanks for the question. Our clinical research group has performed incredibly well, a great first year as part of the company, exceeding our own high level of ambition for the business. Integration has gone smoothly. Customers really see the obvious fit with the company. And that really has driven very strong momentum. And our colleagues are very excited about the combination. So as I think about the different elements of performance, the book-to-bill was very positive. Authorizations were very strong in the quarter and the year. So we entered the year with very strong momentum in terms of the backlog that we have in the business and the authorizations.  The revenue synergies, the way I would think about it is in two phases. Because of the long-cycle nature from a win to revenue, we've won extremely substantial revenue synergies that will show up in the financials in 2023 and beyond. We had a small amount of revenue that came into the numbers last year. But we're talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars of wins that we've achieved from an authorization standpoint, so extremely positive.  And in terms of our thoughts about 2023, it will grow above the company's average of the 7% growth that we outlined in the core, so a nice contributor to the success. And really, it's been a seamless integration for the team. And I'm very grateful for that. Excellent. And then I wanted to ask about the COVID vaccines and therapeutics. So you're assuming $500 million for the year. My question is simple. Just how core are your core sales? Would you ever consider changing this definition, just confidence in the handoff as it pertains to bioprocessing in 2023? Yes. So Jack, thanks for the question. But when I think about the $500 million, right, and when I look at that, that number is primarily related to our Pharma Services activity. It's around actually producing the active pharmaceutical ingredients for the therapies. It's for the sterile fill-finish primarily for the vaccines and some of the therapies. So we have pretty good visibility to that number. So I feel good about that. We decided back, I guess, 1.5 years ago, or whenever the exact time frame we did the definition of core, was we invested in capacity. And if you think about a sterile fill-finish line, as an example, can be used for a COVID vaccine. It can also be used for pretty much any other biologic and even some of the small molecules, right? And therefore, our view was we would transition that capacity over time. And we have been and we will. The other aspect of core is that if you think about how strong our growth was last year, well above our own ambitions. Even the 12% we had laid out at the end of the third quarter, we've already transitioned a meaningful amount of that revenue in terms of other activities. So we didn't contemplate at all about changing the definition of what success is. We think 7% is the right number for us. That core is the right definition for us. We'll provide transparency during the year about the different components as we always do so that investors can understand how we're getting there. But I feel great about the outlook, and I'm very proud of what the team delivered last year. We have the next question from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Marc, maybe one on the Analytical Instruments business. 14% growth for the year is obviously pretty impressive. You guys have seen elevated growth for a good stretch here. It did step down a little bit against an easier comp. So just wanted to get more color, I guess, on what you're seeing on the demand side, how you're seeing order trends and bookings there, visibility into 2023. I know you've had this elevated backlog we've talked a lot about. It seems like some peers are expecting kind of a normalization or moderation in the second half as we work our way through the year. So I want to get your perspective of what you're seeing there. Yes, Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the Analytical Instruments business, a really strong year, excellent execution. There's nothing different in Q4 than in Q3, so I wouldn't read anything into that. When I look at what's driving it, last year, you saw good market conditions. Funding was clearly strong. I don't know if there was a little bit of pent-up demand from 2020, I don't know. But the funding was clearly available. We did very well with our innovation, right? We stayed committed to innovation throughout the early phase of the pandemic, making sure we have robust pipelines. You saw that in the stream of launches in our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy businesses, those products have been well adopted. We're clearly growing very well. And as you know, we've also built on a very strong presence in enabling the next generation of semiconductors, battery applications. The most advanced aspects of material science is a different market position than really anybody else has in the industry. And that's driving great growth, right? And you can see it in our electron microscopy numbers. I'm very proud of how the team has executed. So that's kind of the context of why the elevated growth. So as I think about bookings demand, very strong throughout the year. So we have good visibility to the first half. It's when those -- most of those orders will ship. We would expect that the Analytical Instruments business will be a really nice contributor to our growth for the year. And I think it's reasonable to assume that the growth normalizes more in the second half as an assumption. It's not that I see something different or something happening in the market conditions. But our visibility is typically 6 months. So at the end of the first quarter, we'll have good visibility into the third quarter, and we'll keep you posted. But I think for modeling purpose, I think, normalization in the second half was a good assumption. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Stephen on the margins. Gross margins seem to have rebased. I would love just your perspective of what those look like in '23, first off. And then maybe just the additional areas of leverage kind of down the P&L coming out of COVID, you mentioned maybe some elevated strategic investments in '22. Obviously, we saw some things like one-time bonuses that are pretty clear. But would be helpful if you could just talk through the moving pieces, what areas of additional leverage you do have coming out of '22. Because again, the mix, obviously as LPS becomes bigger, the margins should kind of be lower. But you guys are putting up pretty good numbers. So just trying to figure out again a little bit of moving pieces and areas of leverage you have when you think about that 23.9% for '23. Yes. So Patrick, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin profile going forward, that 7% to 9% core organic growth driving 40 to 50 basis points is the right way to think about that company. And the margin opportunity there, you've got a little bit of -- that assumes a little bit of price benefit, good volume leverage that comes with that and still investing in the business to maintain that top line growth. And then a continuation of using PPI that kind of decomplex the company.  But I think that margin profile still holds in terms of going from the 23.9% going forward post 2023, I think about the levers that we have. As you saw in this past year, we had a slightly different mix, a lot higher growth in certain parts of our business. And certainly, margins were slightly different in Q4 than we had in the prior guide. But the revenue is significantly higher. And what really matters is operating income dollars that we're driving. And that's incredibly strong. And our margin profile, the mix then holds into 2023. And then therefore, that kind of 7% to 9% driving that 40 to 50 is a good way to model the company. And then just gross margins for '23, if you have them? I don't really want to give guidance for every single element of the P&L. We're trying to manage a complex company. But a similar margin profile to where we are right now is probably a good starting point. But it really depends on the mix and also changes in currency. And our job is to manage the whole thing and deliver great results. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan. So first up, just on China. China declined mid-single digits during 4Q. And you say that some of that was testing roll-offs. You also talked about how China is part of the reason that, that core growth is going to ramp throughout the year. So can you just walk us through what are you embedding for China growth for 1Q and then for total 2023? And then can you also just spend a minute talking about the underlying demand trends for China and how you plan for the reopening trade? Rachel, thanks for the question. So if I step at the highest level with China, right, historically been our fastest-growing end market. We have a very strong position. Our enabling technologies are important to life sciences and food safety and the biologics industry in China, et cetera, so good demand drivers long term, long historical perspective. When I think about last year, the team delivered high single-digit growth for the year. When I think about the fourth quarter, you had very, very significant disruptions from the end of the COVID -- zero-COVID policies, right?  So you went from this period where I think at least we had no problem navigating through the challenges of the lockdown policies. But when you have 50%, 60%, 70% of colleagues with COVID, that's obviously highly disruptive. And so you saw the first half of the quarter was strong, the second half of the quarter was weak. Our assumption for this year is that the zero-COVID -- opening up the economy leads to a weaker first quarter, a strong rebound in the balance of the year.  China will grow on our expectations in our guidance a little bit faster for the full year than our core growth. So that's how I would think about it. So a really strong end market, including the disruption from Q1. I think the team has done actually -- I'm very impressed with how they've dealt with all of the complexities and keeping our colleagues safe. It's been a challenging period of time. Great. And then maybe just kind of digging deeper on Patrick's question around margins, so you did 22.4% adjusted op margin for 4Q. You guided to a step-down on that operating margin line during 1Q but then hitting that 23.9%-ish for the year for 2023. So can you just kind of bridge us through the math there on margins and how that gives you confidence in the back half of the year to be able to round out at just shy of 24%? Yes. So Rachel, thanks for the question. So when I think about the margin progression through the year, Q1, we got a very significant roll-off in highly profitable testing revenue. And the cost actions against that to enable a 40% pull-through for the year, it's a combination of cost actions and a non-repeat of certain one-time things that we were doing on compensation in the prior year. Those things spread over the whole year.  So you get a little bit of benefit in Q1 to offset part of that profitability, but more of that offset really coming in the following 3 quarters. So that's really the largest piece to it. Now FX is a headwind to margins in Q1. So that's a slight aspect to it. And then the phasing of the China activity is another aspect of that, kind of lower level of activity in Q1 and then ramping up to a higher level of revenue in Q4. Helpful. And then maybe just squeezing one more in here, on industrial and applied, you grew low-teens in 4Q. So can you just give us a little bit more granularity on that performance during the quarter, if there's any pockets of outpaced strength or softness relative to your expectations? And then how are you thinking about that industrial and applied market for 2023, given the macro backdrop? And is there any conservatism there in the assumed guidance? Yes. So industrial and applied was very strong in the quarter, low-teens growth in the quarter, really strong demand and shipments for our chromatography, mass spectrometry and electron microscopy business. So we didn't see any concerns. Our assumption for the year is that it's going to grow at about the average rate growth for the full year. So that's what we're assuming in the guidance. We now have Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. So Stephen, not to pick on the margin point, but I do want to sort of clarify something. I mean, I -- looking at the 40 to 50 basis points of expansion, so let's say you do 100 next couple of years, I mean, at your Analyst Day in May, you talked about a 26%-ish adjusted operating margin, excluding the impact of capital deployment. Are -- I mean, can you sort of just walk us through sort of like how you're thinking about the 2025 outlook that you provided and sort of like general thoughts around that in there? Go ahead, Stephen. Yes, when I think about margin profile, it's in combination with revenue dollars. So our revenue dollars are materially higher than we had incorporated into my long-term model. In combination with that plus the margin gets you to a very strong operating income dollars. And that's what's driving EPS. So I'm -- so we're well positioned with the long-term model. Great. That's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify that as well. And then just one quick follow-up, I assume there's some residual COVID business in your PPD. You talked about core growth being 20%. What is the headwind in the PPD business from leftover COVID going from '23 to -- '22 to '23? Yes. There's some activity of studies that will roll off over multiple years in terms of required follow-on studies and activity there that the team, as those studies come off, they just have moved to other areas of the therapeutic range. So that really has been done quite seamlessly. And as you know, with the business scaling the way it is, having a large capable team is a great way to be able to be ready to serve the next set of customer work, so pretty straightforward. And just if I can also, can I squeeze one more in? CapEx sort of outlook as we go from '23, you've been adding a lot of facilities. Can you sort of talk about what you're thinking about '23/'24? So '23, as Stephen said, it's a couple of billion dollars. And we'll continue to -- it will kind of go down to a glidepath back to that 3.5% -- 3% to 3.5% over time. So nothing has changed in that assumption. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Maybe, Marc, to kick it off, just I'm all in on Aaron Rodgers if the Jets can get them. That would be a struggling company getting -- that would be like a struggling company getting you as their CEO would be a great deal, I think. So one of my questions here.  Maybe the first one, just obviously, there's a lot of concerns in the industry broadly on the near-term drag on revenue growth for biologic drug products, given the inventory depletion that's ongoing in the industry. You've been pretty confident that, for various reasons, Thermo is really not seeing this. Just would be interested to get an update on kind of just on your thinking there and kind of what you're assuming in your outlook for 7% growth for your businesses both on the consumable side and then on the Patheon services side? Yes. So in terms of football, hope springs eternal until the first snap. In terms of the bioproduction business, what I would say is a few points. Obviously, not every single player has reported, but a couple of them have. So we have a sense of how the industry did and what others have said. When I think about last year, our bioproduction business just crushed it again, right? It's just phenomenal performance well above the rate of growth of our pharma and biotech customer set. And that's 3 years in a row of really very strong growth. I'm very proud of how the team has executed. When I think about 2023, against tougher comparisons, obviously, the growth will normalize a bit. And I would expect that based on some of the COVID comparisons of the first half of 2022 that you'll see more normalization in the first half. Stronger in the second half is the pattern. But it's a good business with incredibly bright prospects. So from that perspective, I feel good about how the team is managing it with what '23 will contribute and what the long term is going to be fantastic. Pharma Services business has had a very good year, very strong growth, has brought its capacity online very effectively and winning a lot of new business. We still have activity this year that's meaningful in the vaccine and therapies for COVID. And then as those wind down at some point in time, it's hard to know what the longer-term visibility is for that. That capacity just gets repurposed all the time. So we do that in an orderly fashion. So that's how we think about it. But a really strong year and some really nice meaningful wins throughout 2022 that sets up the Pharma Services business for a good year and [indiscernible]. Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up, obviously, your business mix is a lot less cyclical today than it was back in the prior downturn. Just wondering, implicit in the 7%, Rachel asked a question on industrial business. But just to what extent does your guide bake in some cushion for a potential slowdown that could unfold, given weaker macro? Yes. So what we assumed is normal market conditions, right? And the way I would characterize last year was above-normal market conditions. So normal in my definition is market goes 4% to 6%, right? And we said that for a very, very long time. So that's what we're assuming for this year. If it's materially different than that, meaning that if the market conditions look anything like they looked last year, we're going to grow well above the core guidance. If the market conditions are meaningfully worse than what's assumed in normal market conditions, then we're going to grow lower than the fourth quarter organic that we outlined.  So nothing is dramatic about that, and we'll be super transparent. And all our investors will understand, if the world is totally different than what it looks like on February 1, what we know is that we're going to manage incredibly well. So whatever the world throws at us, we'll come out with great short-term performance and a much stronger industry leader for the long term. And that's what's super cool about Thermo Fisher. Because it's our job to manage the dynamics and do it great and do a great job for our investors. So I'm excited for what the world holds in 2023 and beyond. We now have Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Congrats on a really strong finish to the year. I had two parts, maybe I'll ask them both upfront. Marc, the first part for you on -- when I look at this guidance on base organic, excluding vaccine, I think the business did -- the business is assuming perhaps low double-digit organic here in fiscal '23. And that's coming off of perhaps a mid-teens comp. One, is that math correct, that base business, excluding vaccine, double digits? And what does it assume? I'm thinking biopharma has to grow at least mid-teens to get to that 9% to 10%. And it seems pretty strong. Do those numbers make sense? And Stephen, the second part for you on margins here, what are you assuming for decremental margins on COVID and margins on FX? And did I hear you correctly on Q1 is starting at 22%? Just want to make sure I heard the numbers right. Sure. So in terms of the guidance in the 7% core, we did not do a lot of machinations about excluding this or that. I think from the math, the way you're doing it is that if you excluded the vaccines and therapies, it would imply that the growth was 9% or 10%, somewhere in that range is about what the growth would be on that measure, for which we're not using that particular measure. Therefore, you can't sort of speculate on sort of all the dynamics. It's much better to just say relative to our 7% growth, pharma and biotech, we expect to grow above that, right, in terms of its contribution to the 7%. And we would assume that the industrial and applied would grow around the 7% core and the other 2 markets a little bit below. So that's how you should think about the different dynamics. Yes. Vijay, in terms of the pull-through on the lower testing revenue, as I outlined on the last call, the assumption is approximately 40% in aggregate for the whole year. But that doesn't all -- that's not the same in every single quarter. The offsetting cost actions against a very significant profitability pull-through, which is higher than that on a contribution margin basis, that's spread across each of the quarters.  But the revenue drop is largely just in Q1. So that's why you have the margin profile that I outlined for Q1. And the indication I gave for Q1 margin profile at this point is slightly below what has the margin in Q4. So the largest driver there is that large drop in very profitable testing. And then the offset on the cost to get it to the 40% pull-through spreads throughout the year. Our final question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Stifel. Marc, maybe just one on bioprocess, bioproduction. I just wanted to ask whether you're seeing any differences in purchasing patterns and the way that inventories just appear as though they're being managed when you look at CDMOs versus the biopharmas themselves. There has been some conversation around just timelines that look like they might materialize on destocking. So curious if you can just sort of help us with what may be taking place, given where you sit here. Yes. Dan, just sort of along the line with Dan Brennan's question, really not much to add, right, which is phenomenal 2022. We created a really challenging and exciting comparison. We get paid to create those comparisons. And I would expect that would show up in a more normalized growth in the first half and a little bit stronger than that in the second half. I think there's much color between the different customer types that would provide much more insight on it.  Well, so let me wrap it up here. Thanks, everyone, for participating in the call. With another strong year behind us, we're in a great position to achieve another excellent year in 2023. And as always, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And we look forward to updating you during the course of the year as it progresses. Thanks, everyone. Thank you all for joining. That does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely day, and you may now disconnect your lines."

         "Good afternoon. My name is Dave, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.  Ms. Deborah Crawford, Meta's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin. Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Meta Platforms Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. Javier Olivan, COO, is also on the call and will join Mark and Susan for the Q&A portion.  Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. All right. Hey, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. 2022 is a challenging year, but I think we ended it having made good progress on our main priorities and setting ourselves up to deliver better results this year as long as we keep pushing on efficiency. And I said last quarter that I thought our product trends look better than most of the commentary out there suggests. And I think that's even more the case now. We reached more than 3.7 billion people monthly across our Family of Apps. On Facebook, we now reached 2 billion daily actives and almost 3 billion monthly. The number of people daily using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is the highest it's ever been.  Now before getting into our product priorities, I want to discuss my management theme for 2023, which is the Year of Efficiency. We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams. And when we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end. And since then, we've taken some additional steps, like working with our infrastructure team on how to deliver our road map while spending less on CapEx. Next, we're working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster as well as deploying AI tools to help our engineers be more productive.  As part of this, we're going to be more proactive about cutting projects that aren't performing or may no longer be as crucial. But my main focus is on increasing the efficiency of how we execute our top priorities. So I think that there's going to be some more that we can do to improve our productivity, speed and cost structure. And by working on this over a sustained period, I think we'll both build a stronger technology company and become more profitable.  I'm very focused on doing this in a way that helps us build better product. And because of that, even if our business outperforms our goals, this will stay our management theme for the year since I think it's going to make us a better company. Now at the same time, I'm also focused on delivering better financial results than what we've reported recently and on meeting the expectation that I outlined last year of delivering compounding earnings growth even while investing aggressively in future technology.  And next, I want to give some updates on our priority areas. Our priorities haven't changed since last year. The 2 major technological waves driving our road map are AI today and, over the longer term, the metaverse. So first, let's talk about our AI discovery engine. Facebook and Instagram are shifting from being organized solely around people and accounts you follow to increasingly showing more relevant content recommended by our AI systems. And this covers every content format, which is something that makes our services unique. But we're especially focused on short-form video since Reels is growing so quickly. And I'm really proud of our progress here. The Reels plays across Facebook and Instagram have more than doubled over the last year, while the social component of people resharing Reels has grown even faster and has more than doubled on both apps in just the last 6 months.  The next bottleneck that we're focused on to continue growing Reels is improving monetization efficiency or the revenue that's generated per minute of Reels watched. Currently, the monetization efficiency of Reels is much less than Feed. So the more that Reels grows, even though it adds engagement to the system overall, it takes some time away from Feed, and we actually lose money. But people want to see more Reels, though. So the key to unlocking that is improving our monetization efficiencies that way we can show more Reels without losing increasing amounts of money. We're making progress here, and our monetization efficiency on Facebook has doubled in the past 6 months.    In terms of the revenue headwind, we're still on track to be roughly neutral by the end of this year or maybe early next year. And then after that, we should be able to profitably grow Reels while keeping up with the demand that we see.  In our broader ads business, we're continuing to invest in AI, and we're seeing our efforts pay off here. In the last quarter, advertisers saw over 20% more conversions than in the year before. And combined with the decline in cost per acquisition, this has resulted in higher returns on ad spend.  We continue to be excited about the monetization opportunity with business messaging, too. Facebook and Instagram are the first 2 pillars of our business. And in the next few years, we hope to bring messaging online as the next pillar. One way of doing this is click-to-message ads, which is now the $10 billion run rate. And paid messaging is the other piece of this. We're earlier here, but we continue to onboard more businesses to the WhatsApp Business Platform where they can answer customer questions and updates and sell directly in chat. So for example, Air France has started using WhatsApp to share boarding passes and other information, other flight information, in 22 countries and 4 languages. And businesses often tell us that more people open their messages and they get better results on WhatsApp than other channels.  AI, it's the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business. And we also think that it's going to enable many new products and additional transformations in our apps. Generative AI is an extremely exciting new area, with so many different applications. And one of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative AI, in addition to our leading work in recommendation AI.  So the last area that I want to talk about is the metaverse. We shipped Quest Pro at the end of last year. I'm really proud of it. It's the first mainstream mixed reality device. I mean we are setting the standard for the industry with our Meta Reality system. As always, the reason why we're focused on building these platforms is to deliver better social experiences than what's possible today on phones. And the value of MR is that you can experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world around you. We're already seeing developers build out some impressive new experiences like Nanome for 3D modeling, molecules and drug development; Arkio for architects and designers to create interiors; and of course, a lot of great games. The MR ecosystem is relatively new, but I think it's going to grow a lot over the next few years. Later this year, we're going to launch our next-generation consumer headset, which will feature Meta Reality as well. And I expect that this is going to establish this technology as the baseline for all headsets going forward and eventually, of course, for AR glasses as well.  Beyond MR, the broader VR ecosystem continues growing. There are now over 200 apps on our VR devices that have made more than $1 million in revenue. We're also continuing to make progress with avatars. We just launched avatars on WhatsApp last quarter, and more than 100 million people have already created avatars in the app. And of those, about 1 in 5 are using their avatar as their WhatsApp profile photo. And I thought that, that was an interesting example of how the Family of Apps and metaverse visions come together because -- and even though most of our Reality Labs investment is going towards future computing platforms -- glasses, headsets and the software to run them -- as the technology develops, most people are going to experience the metaverse for the first time on phones and then start building up their digital identities across our apps. All right. So those are the areas we're focused on, AI, including our discovery engine, ads, business messaging and increasingly generative AI and the future platforms for the metaverse. And from an operating perspective, we are focused on efficiency and continuing to streamline the company so we can execute these priorities as well as possible and build a better company while improving our business performance. And as always, I'm grateful to our teams for your work on all of these important areas and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now over to Susan. Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.  Q4 total revenue was $32.2 billion, down 4% or up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $2 billion higher. Q4 total expenses were $25.8 billion, up 22% compared to last year.  In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 31%, driven mostly by a write-down of certain data center assets as well as growth in infrastructure-related costs. R&D increased 39%, marketing and sales increased 4%, and G&A decreased 7%. Operating lease impairments and employee-related costs were the largest contributors to growth for all 3 expense lines. However, growth in marketing and sales was partially offset by lower marketing spend, and growth in G&A was more than fully offset by a decrease in legal-related expenses.  We ended the fourth quarter with over 86,400 employees, which includes a substantial majority of the approximately 11,000 employees impacted by our previously announced layoff who remained on payroll as of December 31 due to applicable legal requirements. We expect the vast majority of the impacted employees will no longer be captured in our reported headcount figures by the end of the first quarter of 2023.  Fourth quarter operating income was $6.4 billion, representing a 20% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Net income was $4.7 billion or $1.76 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.2 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.  Free cash flow was $5.3 billion, and we ended the year with $40.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.9 billion of our Class A common stock, bringing our total share repurchases for the full year to $27.9 billion. We had $10.9 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of December 31. And today, we announced a $40 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization.  Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 2.96 billion people use at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in December, and that approximately 3.74 billion people used at least one on a monthly basis.  Facebook continues to grow globally, and engagement remains strong. We reached 2 billion Facebook daily active users for the first time in December, up 4% or 71 million compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.96 billion monthly active users in December. MAUs grew by 51 million or 2% compared to last year.  Q4 total Family of Apps revenue was $31.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $31.3 billion, down 4%, but up 2% on a constant currency basis. Consistent with our expectations, Q4 revenue remained under pressure from weak advertising demand, which we believe continues to be impacted by the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape. The financial services and technology verticals were the largest negative contributors to the year-over-year decline in Q4, but both have relatively smaller shares of our revenue.  Growth remained negative in our largest verticals, online commerce and CPG, though the pace of year-over-year decline in online commerce has slowed compared to last quarter. The largest positive contributors to year-over-year growth in Q4 were the travel and health care verticals, though both are relatively smaller verticals in absolute share.  Foreign currency remained a significant headwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World at 5%. North America was flat, while Asia Pacific and Europe declined 3% and 16%, respectively. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 23%, and the average price per ad decreased 22%. Impression growth was primarily driven by the Asia Pacific and Rest of World regions.  The year-over-year decline in pricing was primarily driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions, lower advertiser demand and foreign currency depreciation. While overall pricing remains under pressure from these factors, we have continued to make improvements to our ads targeting and measurement that, we believe, are driving more conversions and better returns for advertisers.  Family of Apps' other revenue was $184 million in Q4, up 19%, with strong business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform, partially offset by a decline in other line items. We continue to direct the majority of our investments towards the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps' expenses were $20.8 billion, representing 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps' expenses were up 23% due primarily to restructuring-related expenses and growth in infrastructure-related costs.  Family of Apps' operating income was $10.7 billion, representing a 34% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $727 million, down 17% due to lower Quest 2 sales. Reality Labs expenses were $5 billion, up 20% due primarily to employee-related costs and restructuring-related expenses. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.3 billion.  Before turning to the outlook, I'd like to discuss our work to grow profitability by scaling monetization and improving our operational efficiency. There are 2 primary levers to increasing monetization: growing supply and growing demand. Growing ad supply gives businesses more opportunities to get in front of people, and we are focused on enabling that in a couple of ways.  First and foremost, we remain focused on building engaging experiences for the people who use our apps. We are coming into 2023 with a strong foundation as Reels continues to scale, and we're seeing in-feed recommendations contribute to engagement as we help people discover new content in their feeds. We will continue to invest in making these experiences best in class.  The other side of growing supply comes from more effectively monetizing the surfaces within our apps, including those that have a lower level of ads today. In the nearer term, ramping Reels monetization remains a primary focus. Over the longer term, we see opportunities to continue improving Facebook and Instagram monetization while also scaling revenue contributions from our messaging platforms.  Growing advertiser demand is the other focus, and a big effort here is around continuing to drive advertiser performance. While we're still contending with the broader macro uncertainty and signals landscape weighing on advertiser demand in the near term, we're making good progress on our road map and are already seeing improvements to add performance and measurement from the investments we've made.  We see opportunities for continued gains in the near and medium term, with our AI investments powering a lot of this work as we continue to improve ads ranking and enable increased automation for advertisers to make it easier for them to run campaigns and use our systems to optimize their performance. Another opportunity we have is to further scale on-site conversions through products like click-to-message, lead ads and shop ads.  Click-to-message ads continue to grow quickly, and we believe they're bringing incremental demand onto our platform, with over half of click-to-message advertisers exclusively using click-to-messaging ads on our platform. We see further opportunity as we continue to scale click-to-WhatsApp ads and are investing in growing newer formats like shop ads. Over the long term, we're investing heavily in AI to develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies and continue building new tools that will make it easier for advertisers to create and deliver more relevant and engaging ads.  Moving now to our efficiency work. We took significant actions in 2022 to operate more efficiently. In Q4, we made the difficult decision to lay off employees while deprioritizing certain projects and curtailing non-headcount-related expenses. We have applied the same scrutiny to our physical assets. We identified opportunities to consolidate our office facilities, and we have streamlined our future data centers to a new architecture, which we believe will be more cost efficient and more flexible that provides us optionality to support both AI and non-AI workloads.  In Q4, we recorded $4.2 billion of total restructuring costs in connection with all of these efforts, and expect there to be some additional costs in 2023 in areas like office facilities impairments as we continue this work. As Mark has said, these actions are just the beginning of our efficiency efforts, and we remain keenly focused on this in 2023. We are working across the company to deprioritize lower ROI work, move faster, increase productivity and reduce costs across the business. As part of this, we are carefully scrutinizing our hiring needs, actively reevaluating projects and reducing management layers. I'm confident that our company-wide focus on efficiency will position us to be an even more productive organization going forward.  Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect first quarter 2023 total revenue to be in the range of $26 billion to $28.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency will be an approximately 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the first quarter based on current exchange rates.  Turning now to the expense outlook. We anticipate our full year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $89 billion to $95 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $100 billion due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue. We now expect to record an estimated $1 billion in restructuring charges in 2023 related to consolidating our office facilities footprint. This is down from our prior estimate of $2 billion as we recorded a portion of the charges in the fourth quarter of 2022. We may incur additional restructuring charges as we progress further in our efficiency efforts.  Turning now to the CapEx outlook for 2023. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $30 billion to $33 billion, lowered from our prior estimate of $34 billion to $37 billion. The reduced outlook reflects our updated plans for lower data center construction spend in 2023 as we shift to a new data center architecture that is more cost efficient and can support both AI and non-AI workloads. Substantially, all of our capital expenditures continue to support the Family of Apps.  On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2023 tax rate percentage to be in the low 20s. In addition, as noted on previous calls, we continue to monitor developments regarding the viability of transatlantic data transfers and their potential impact on our European operations.  In closing, 2022 was a challenging but pivotal year for our business. We made important progress on our priorities and have taken significant steps to improve our efficiency and productivity. We are set up well to build on this work in 2023 as we continue investing for future growth while remaining focused on delivering strong financial performance.  With that, Dave, let's open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. I have 2, one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, the first one is on generative AI. I sort of wanted to dig a little more into how you think about your Bluesky potential user and advertiser use cases of generative AI. And how do you think about the time line for when we can foresee some glimpses of those on the platform?  And then the second one for Susan. Just any more color on the new data center architecture and how we should think about the long-term capital intensity of the business, whether it's CapEx per minute, CapEx per DAU. How big of a long-term benefit could this change be to the overall cash flow? Yes, I can start with generative AI. I think this is a really exciting area. And I mean I'd say the 2 biggest themes that focused on for this year, one is efficiency and then the kind of the new product area is going to be the generative AI work. We have a bunch of different work streams across almost every single one of our products to use the new technologies, especially the large language models and diffusion models for generating images and videos and avatars and 3D assets and all kinds of different stuff across all of the different work streams that we're working on, as well as over the long term, working on things that could really empower creators to be way more productive and creative across the apps and run a lot of different accounts.  So I know there's some really exciting stuff here. I want to be careful not to kind of get too far ahead of the development of it. So I think you'll see us launch a number of different things this year, and we'll talk about them, and we'll share updates on how they're doing. I do expect that the space will move quickly. I think we'll learn a lot about what works and what doesn't. A lot of the stuff is expensive, right, to kind of generate an image or a video or a chat interaction. These things we're talking about, like cents or fraction of a cent. So one of the big interesting challenges here also is going to be how do we scale this and make this work more efficient so that way we can bring it to a much larger user base. But I think once we do that, there are going to be a number of very exciting use cases. I realize this is a pretty high-level answer for now, but I think that we'll be able to share more details over the coming months. Thanks, Brian. On your questions about CapEx. So your first question was about the new data center architecture that we talked about, which is underpinning the lowered CapEx outlook. So we're shifting our data centers to a new architecture that can more efficiently support both AI and non-AI workloads. And that's going to give us more optionality as we better understand our demand for AI over time. Additionally, we're expecting that the new design will be cheaper and faster to build than previous data center architecture.  Along with the new data center architecture, we're going to optimize our approach to building data centers. So we have a new phased approach that allows us to build base plans with less initial capacity and less initial capital outlay, but then flex up future capacity quickly if needed. We're still planning to grow AI capacity significantly, and that connects, I think, to a lot of the things that Mark was describing earlier in his question.  In terms of longer-run capital intensity, we certainly expect that the lower CapEx outlook will have some incremental benefit to CapEx as a percent of revenue, and that's still really something that we are focused on over the longer term. The current surge in CapEx is really due to the building out of AI infrastructure, which we really began last year and are continuing into this year. We'll be measuring the ROI of these AI investments, and their returns will continue to inform our future spend. Our intention is still to bring CapEx as a percent of revenue down, but capital intensity in the nearest term is really going to depend, in part, on the revenue outlook and our needs to further build AI capacity for future demand. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Maybe I can ask a multiparter on going back to some of your comments on Reels. Mark, you always had this philosophy of letting the user sort of continue to grow engagement, and monetization has always lagged sort of consumer adoption of new products. How do you think about going a little bit deeper on the mixture of letting the engagement of short-form video continue to build versus eventually sort of continuing to drive higher levels of monetization against that product.  Second, can you give us a little bit of color of how advertiser conversations continue to evolve around short-form video and the adoption of the Canvas and the utilization of that as a means to deliver a mixture of brand and DR messages? And then lastly would just be, can you quantify at all the gap that still exists between the engagement around short-term video and the monetization and how that might close as we look out over the next couple of years? Yes. I mean the way that I've always looked at -- the second take the first part of this, is that for these consumer products, often building up and scaling the product use case is a somewhat different discipline than working on the monetization. So it's such a kind of hard problem to build these new types of products that you want to give the teams as much clarity and as simple of goals as possible. So in the beginning, just saying, okay, just let's make something that works for people. And then once we get to many hundreds of millions of people or billions of people using it, then we'll focus on ramping up the monetization, which has been a formula that's worked for us. That's the general approach.  Now with Reels, we do have a lot of people using it now. So I think at this point, the question is, is there any strategic advantage to letting it scale further than will be -- than would be profitable to do? And I think at the scale that it's at right now, it's not clear that there's much strategic advantage. I mean there are certain flywheels, and you get certain more feedback or data points from a little bit more distribution. But at this point, we're a pretty good scale. So I think for now, the right thing to do is to work on monetization efficiency. And we know that there is demand to see some more Reels. And as we naturally improve the monetization efficiency, which I have confidence in because the teams are doing good work, and that's been working, I shared the stat about it, the efficiency doubling over the last 6 months on Facebook, I think as we can continue some of those trends, then we'll naturally just unlock the ability to show more and more Reels, and we'll continue to grow from there.  But that's the overall approach. I do think that our philosophy of building these consumer products, focusing on getting them to hundreds of millions or billions of people and then focusing on monetization beyond that and bringing that in as the balance is the right approach. It served us well. You can expect us to continue doing that on future things that we do, including some -- hopefully, some of the new generative AI products or some of the new metaverse stuff that we're doing. We're going to take the same approach there as well. So on the advertisers reaction to Reels. We continue working on enabling more advertisers to participate in Reels app, more formats, more objectives, more tools to create them. And we've been making good progress with now over 40% of our advertisers use Reels app across our apps. And between direct response versus brand, we're actually seeing progress with both. But direct response continues to be where advertisers are focused. And just as an example, Outletcity, which is a German fashion retailer, developed creatives specifically for Reels to test the impact of the conversions. And they found that Reels resulted in a 19x higher ROAS, 89% lower cost per purchase and 9x higher lift in sales. So overall, very good results. On your third question, Eric, we are not quantifying the gap in monetization efficiency between Reels and other services. We know it took us several years to bring the gap close between Stories and Feed ads. And we expect that this will take longer for Reels. Having said that, we are still roughly on track to bring the overall Reels revenue headwind to a neutral place by the end of this year or early next year. And we're planning to do that through both improving Reels monetization efficiency and growing incremental engagement from Reels. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. I've got a couple as well. First one, I know for Susan or Javier. As we think about -- I appreciate the color on improving conversion rate. Would it be fair to say that you're kind of through the other side of some of those IDFA headwinds we've been talking about for the last year or so? And any more color just kind of that journey of the AI-driven adage would be appreciated.  And secondly, Mark, kind of diving in that annual theme of efficiency and following on Buzz's post. What's the right way to think about long-term investment intensity in Reality Labs and kind of balancing that with the ambition to build the next computing platform? Is this the right intensity of kind of where you're at right now to think about? Or are there any milestones we should be looking for? Thanks, Mark. So on your first question, we are continuing to make progress in mitigating the impact from the ATT change. But this is more generally just the reality of the online advertising environment that we operate in now. So we're continuing to work on building tools that mitigate the impact of those changes, and we see strong adoption of those tools, including tools we've talked about before like CAPI Gateway, et cetera.  We're also investing in ways to bring conversions on site, and we have a lot of ad formats that have been instrumental in doing so across both click-to-messaging ads, leads ads -- lead ads and shop ads being formats that bring conversions on site. And then over the longer run, we're continuing to invest in our privacy-enhancing technologies to more fundamentally enable us to deliver more performance and privacy-safe ads to advertisers.  Javi, is there anything you want to add on that? Yes. And I think, Susan, you touched on most of it. I think if you look at the strategy on ads, we really have 2 parts, which is continue investing in AI, and that's where we're seeing a lot of the improvement in ads relevance. And as Mark was saying, we saw over 20% more conversions than in the prior year, which, combined with the decline in cost per acquisition, results on higher ROAS. We also use it for automated experiences for the advertisers, improvements on measurement, which allow advertisers to do better budget decisions.  But the second part is bringing more conversions on site, which are also obviously helping, offsetting this signal loss. Indeed, we're reframing the [ column ] of signal growth opportunity. And one example we believe that were -- just to give another example, [ IDF ], which is an online marketing and sales automation agency in Italy for hotels and resorts. They use this app to collect a higher volume of qualified leads at a lower cost, so basically compared to off-site leads and in the leads off-site. They managed to achieve a 2x more final bookings with on-site leads, 4x more qualified leads with on-site leads and a 2.7x lower cost per lead with on-site versus the alternative option in the lead acquisition off-site. All right. And I can give some color on -- and I think there was a question about how we're thinking about this efficiency theme as it applies to Reality Labs over time. I guess there are 2 ways that I think this applies.  The first thing is, I think it's important to not just think about Reality Labs as one thing, right? There are like 3 major areas, right? There's the augmented reality work long term, which is actually the biggest area, but hasn't -- but it's still a large research problem. There is a lot of work there that we haven't actually shipped the product yet. VR, which is starting to ramp, right? Quest 2, I think, did quite well. We have multiple product lines there with the Quest Pro. And then the smallest by kind of budget size today is the metaverse software program. And that's -- it doesn't reflect the importance of it. I think the software and social platform might be the most critical part of what we're doing, but software is just a lot less capital-intensive to build than the hardware. So it's the smallest part of the program. And within each of those areas, there are a lot of different things that we're doing.  So just like any project that we would run, we're constantly learning from how the products that we've shipped are doing, how the market is evolving overall, how competitors are doing, and what reaction they're seeing to different things, and what experiments are being played out. And we're kind of constantly tuning the road map. And obviously, some of these are longer-term things, right? So you start planning out the hardware that you're going to ship 2, 3 years in advance. But we're kind of constantly looking at the signals and learning and making decisions about what it makes sense to do forward. So that's definitely going to continue.  And we will -- even though I'm -- none of the signals that I've seen so far suggests that we should shift the Reality Lab strategy long term. We are constantly adjusting the specifics of how we adjust -- of how we execute this. So I think that -- we'll certainly look at that as part of the ongoing efficiency work.  The other piece is just different tactics, things like trying to flatten the org, things like that. Those are going to apply across the whole company. So we expect that within the road map that we're trying to execute, both on Reality Labs and Family of Apps, we just want to focus on making all of our work more efficient. A lot of the time, when people talk about efficiency, there's a lot of focus on prioritization and which big things can you cut. But I actually think what makes you a better company over time is being able to execute and do more things because you're operating more efficiently, and you can get things done with fewer resources. So I'd like to kind of get us to that mode more, which I guess gets me to a higher level point in this, which is I just think we're in -- we've entered somewhat of a phase change for the company, where we just grew so quickly for like the first 18 years of the company's growth. And it's very hard to really crank on efficiency while you're growing that quickly. And I just think we're in a different environment now where we have a bunch of areas that, I mean, you're still extremely exciting and growing quickly for the future, where I think the right strategy will be to focus on kind of top line growth. But I think a lot of what we do, it really just makes sense to really focus on the efficiency a lot more than we had previously and making sure that we can do that work more effectively.  For what it's worth, I think if we do that well, it will be -- I think we'll be able to do better product work. And I think it will be a more fun place for people to work because I think they're going to get more stuff done. So I'm pretty committed to this, and it's going to go across all of the different things that we're doing. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Great. Susan, I know the expense outlook came down by $5 billion. I was just hoping you could talk about some of the areas where you may be able to get increased efficiency still. And then what does the new expense outlook suggest for hiring levels in '23? And then separately, I was hoping you could comment on the issues in Europe around Meta's use of first-party data to target ads. How could this get resolved? And how should we think about the risk to Meta? I'll start with the 2023, the expense outlook. So the primary components of the reduction in the 2023 expense outlook are across 3 areas. The first is slower payroll growth. So we're continuing to scrutinize how we allocate resources across the company on this. We have a broad hiring freeze in place right now. And we continue to expect a slower pace of hiring in the year as we evaluate what roles we're going to open. I'll roll in the answer to your second question here, which is this is an ongoing process for us. We don't presently have a hiring target to share for the end of the year.  The second component of the lower expense outlook is on cost of revenue. We're expecting slower growth. Depreciation here is impacted by us extending the useful lives of non-AI servers in Q4. And then the third component is our outlook now reflects an estimated $1 billion in facilities' consolidation charges. That's down from the prior $2 billion estimate that we gave in the last guidance range since a portion of the previously estimated charges were already recognized in Q4 2022. So those are really the big -- those are really the primary issues as it pertains to the lower expense outlook.  Your second question was on the issues in Europe around Meta using data to target ads. So I think if you're referring to the EU DPC ruling that we have to change our approach regarding our reliance on contractual necessity as a legal basis for ads in Europe, that's a decision. We don't agree with it. We believe that our current approach is GDPR-compliant, and we're appealing the substance of the rulings and the fines. We don't expect that those decisions are going to affect our ability to provide personalized advertising in the EU, and that advertisers should be able to continue to use our platforms to reach customers and grow their businesses. Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Maybe a follow-up on the privacy and data use. Are you still facing headwinds in the first quarter? Or are you kind of past that from IDFA or ATT? And then as you look out over the next year, anything on Android or in the EU with Digital Markets Act? Or anything we should be thinking about or aware of? Thanks, Justin. On ATT, I think what I would say is there is still certainly an absolute headwind to our revenue number. That is the impact of the ATT changes being in place. Having said that, we are lapping its rollout and adoption. And we're making progress in mitigating the impact due to a lot of the work that both Javi and I just talked about, including the different advertiser tools, including ad formats that bring ad conversions on site and including the longer-term AI investments in privacy-enhancing technologies.  The second part of your question was on, oh, anything from Android and other headwinds. On Android, it's too early to know where this will land. I think Google is taking an approach that is collaborating with the industry, which we think is critical, and we'll have updates as more time elapses there. And then your third -- the third part of your question, I think, was on regulatory issues in the EU. I think this was on DSA. We are expecting -- we have been preparing for some time to comply with DSA and meet the compliance deadlines that we expect to come into effect this year. Those are meaningful but manageable segment of costs. We've been preparing for a long time, and those costs have been factored already into our cost -- into our total expense guidance. Your next question comes from the line of use of Youssef Squali with Truist. Two questions for me, please. First, maybe one for Susan. Just staying on the theme of the efficiency and with all the adjustments to your cost basis lately, can you maybe just speak to the relationship you're trying to build between revenue growth and OpEx, CapEx growth over time? I think the last time we saw them move in tandem or close to each other was back in 2017. So are you at a point where you'd want them to grow much closer to each other? Or are we still in an investment mode and therefore, potentially margin compression mode beyond just 2023?  And then maybe, Mark, can you just provide an update on kind of the health of the broad digital ad space, especially for the SMB side and DR? Just curious if coming out of Q4, you're incrementally bullish or you're still as cautious as, say, you were 3 or 6 months ago. First question. So certainly, the lower expense outlook and CapEx outlook puts us in a better position in terms of financial performance for this year. We are, I think, still -- we're focused on the goal that Mark outlined, I think, last quarter of delivering compounding earnings growth, while enabling aggressively in future technology. And that continues to be the principle by which we are -- by which we're guiding our financial plans.  The second question is on update -- on the health of the broader digital ad space. I can take -- I can start with this, and Javi, you should feel free to jump in if you want to add more color. Q4, for us, we saw -- the holiday season, for us, fell mostly within our range of expectations. Trends in online commerce modestly improved for us, which is encouraging, but again, the growth was still negative year-over-year. So overall, I think this is still a pretty volatile macro environment. It's early in the year to know how this will shape up for 2023. And if there's anything, Javi, you'd like to add, you can jump in. No, I think you covered it well, Susan. Your next question will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit more around the progress on the AI discovery engine in Reels. And we're seeing it in our own usage in terms of content and categories and just getting more insights and content that we'd like to see. But can you just talk about the added signal that Meta is seeing and gaining you to produce this more relevant content across Reels to Stories to Feed and maybe even Messenger? I'm not exactly sure what would be useful to share here. But in general, a lot of the gains that we're seeing on the discovery engine overall, which we basically used to refer to our AI recommendation system across Facebook and Instagram across all different content types of which Reels is sort of a special case, and that's growing the fastest with short-form video. But a lot of this is -- I mean there's not like one specific data type that's useful. A lot of the trends that we're seeing here is, we're using larger models, which require more computation. We've shifted the models from being more CPU-based to being GPU-based. We've seen big improvements in the amount of time and engagements that we've gotten. And we -- it's a little bit hard for us to predict exactly how much we'll be able to continue tuning those and improving. But from the experience that we've had so far, I would bet that there's still pretty significant upside there. I know that you kind of asked about specific data points, but I think that, that's really the theme that we're seeing. And that applies across Reels and the rest of the discovery engine.  The one thing that I'd add, it's a little bit separate from your question, but we do spend most of the time talking about Reels, so maybe it's worth giving some color on the rest of the discovery engine work, which is -- has also been doing quite well and is much more incremental to the rest of the business because if people end up being able to discover additional photos or links or groups or things like that in Facebook or just interesting content across Instagram, then they're just more engaged in the product. And we already know how to monetize that content. So that ends up being really helpful both for the overall engagement, not very cannibalistic at all and already profitable. So that's -- we've spent less time talking about that because I get that Reels is sort of the faster-growing area.  But we do still expect that as a percent of the overall feeds in Facebook and Instagram, recommended content will continue growing. I don't know if it will be a majority by the end of this year, but maybe it will be 30-ish percent, 40%, something in that zone, and continuing to grow because we can just find content that people are going to be interested in that may not be from accounts that they've followed directly. So hopefully, that's some useful color on what we're seeing across those efforts. Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Two questions. Just a follow-up on Reality Labs. Should we continue to expect accelerating losses at Reality Labs in '23? And if so, should we expect Reality Labs to be a peak up losses this year? And then second, Susan mentioned shop ads in the bucket of early monetization. Just any color there on how we might see that scale this year. Yes. Sorry, I'll go ahead and take the first question about Reality Labs, and Javi, you can take the second question on shop ads. On Reality Labs, we still expect our full year Reality Labs losses to increase in 2023, and we're going to continue to invest meaningfully in this area given the significant long-term opportunities that we see. It is a long-duration investment, and our investments here are underpinned by the accompanying need to drive overall operating profit growth while we're making these investments.  I'll turn it to Javi on the shop ads. Yes. So in Q4, we continue to test shop ads in the U.S. We're seeing increased performance by helping direct the consumer to the place where they're most likely to purchase. So it's early to know, but we really finally saw product market fit in a test. It's off a small base. But to just give you a sense, we saw triple-digit growth in both revenue and adoption across Q4. We expect this growth to normalize to a lower level in 2023. And the shop ads beta has a revenue run rate in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So that gives you a small base. It's a small revenue run rate yet, but it's growing rapidly. And we expect it to continue, but normalize to more lower levels in 2023. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Two questions, please. The click-to-messaging at now that $10 billion revenue run rate. How do you think about the growth path for that going forwards? And do you find that that's bringing in brand-new advertisers to Meta that you hadn't seen before? Like who's coming in on that? And does that give you a new growth path?  And then, Mark, if I could just ask you. This year of efficiency, it's almost like there's been a journey going on since early last year when you talked about -- talking about driving the business for growing operating profit. And I guess I just want to ask the why question. I mean it's -- the markets obviously like what they're hearing from you today and the changes. But why the much greater focus on efficiency not just tonight, but kind of over the last 9 or 12 months with maybe a few hiccups. Like what -- is it just the maturity of the business? Is it just trying to take on advantage of a crisis, but there is a crisis out there in terms of the economy, and maybe that forced minds to think this way? Just a little bit more color on the why. This is Susan. On the click-to-messaging ads. So we are -- this is one of our fastest-growing ads products, and we believe that they're bringing incremental demand onto our platform. I mentioned in my script that over half of click-to-message advertisers exclusively use click-to-message ads on our platform.  In terms -- you asked how we're going to scale, and I think there are a couple of dimensions. In terms of demand, I think the biggest piece here is getting more businesses to adopt click-to-messaging ads via creating more entry points, simplifying creation flows. We're trying to integrate with partners who can help smaller businesses scale. So there's a lot of work going on there.  On the performance side, we're continuing to focus on just driving up the ROI that advertisers get from click-to-messaging ads. We're trying to give advertisers the ability to do more down-funnel optimization, create better in-thread experiences and simplify flows that help them drive conversion. And then ultimately, we're always focused on growing supply, and in this case, growing the business messaging ecosystem by creating more ways for people and businesses to connect across our messaging app. So I think an example of that would be something like business directory search on WhatsApp. So it's an opportunity we're very excited about and we've invested a lot in and we've seen very healthy growth.  I'll turn it to Mark on the efficiency question. Yes. So I mean, on the efficiency point, I think we come to it from a few places. I mean one is just like the journey of the company. For the first 18 years, I think we grew at 20%, 30% compound or a lot more every year, right? And then obviously, that changed very dramatically in 2022, where our revenue was negative for the growth -- for the first time in the company's history. So that was a pretty big step down. And we don't anticipate that, that's going to continue, but I also don't think it's going to necessarily go back to the way it was before.  So I do think this is a pretty rapid phase change there that I think just forced us to basically take a step back and say, okay, we can't just treat everything like it's hyper growth. There are going to be some areas that are going to be very rapidly growing or that are very kind of future investments that we want to make. But we also have a lot of things now that are -- just have a lot of people using them and support large amounts of business and that we think we should operate somewhat differently. So there's that piece of it.  But the other part of it that I'd say is that as we started doing the work, I actually think it makes us better, right? And that was somewhat unexpected, right? I kind of, historically, would have thought that this would just occupy some amount of our mind space and that, that would be more of a trade-off against how we are able to build products and get things done. But at this point, I'm actually fairly optimistic that there are a pretty good road map of things that we can do that will just make us more efficient and actually better able to build the things that we want.  Not all of them will help save money, right? So for example, focusing on AI tools to help improve engineer productivity, it's not necessarily going to reduce costs. Although over the long term, maybe it will make it so we can have fewer -- we just hire less, right, and stay a smaller company for longer. But I do think things like reducing layers of management just make it so information flows better through the company and so you can make faster decisions. And I think, ultimately, that will help us not only make better products, but I think it will help us attract and retain the best people who want to work in a faster-moving environment.  And so that honestly was a little bit surprising, right, that as we started digging into this that the company would actually start to feel better to me. And I don't know how long that will -- like how long the road map is, if things that we can continue to do where that will be the case. But I do think we have a good amount of things like that. So that's why I'm really focused on this now. And I do want to continue to emphasize the dual goals here of making the company a better technology company and increasing our profitability. They're both important, but I think it's also really important to focus on the first one of just making it a better company because that way, even if we outperform our business goals this year, I just want to communicate, especially the people inside the company that we're going to stick with this, because I think it's just going to make us a better company over the long term. So I think that's it for now. Operator, we have time for one last question. That will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Susan, for your Q1 guidance, can you just remind us all what your embedded expectations are for market conditions, how you think about seasonality? What's embedded in that guidance? Thanks, Brent. For -- I mean for Q1, we are -- our guidance range of $26 billion to $28.5 billion corresponds to negative 7% to plus 2% year-over-year growth. And it reflects a wide range of uncertainty given the continuation of the general macro environment that we've been operating in. Again, we are pleased with the core engagement trends that we've talked about and the performance improvements that we're delivering for advertisers with our monetization work and our investments in AI. And we expect FX to be less of a headwind to year-over-year growth in Q1 than it was in Q4. But again, we are keeping a close eye on advertising demand and on the ongoing macroeconomic volatility. Great. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines."

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs.  Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items.

Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. 2022 was an exceptional year for Merck. Our science-led strategy is working, and I couldn't be more proud of what our team has delivered scientifically, commercially and operationally. We're focusing on what matters and keeping the patient at the center of everything we do.  We made significant progress in 2022 advancing our broad pipeline with important internal success complemented by a portfolio of strategic acquisitions, collaborations and partnerships. We've moved with speed and urgency to drive strong progress, and we have provided increased transparency into several of our long-term opportunities, including for GARDASIL, for our cardiovascular pipeline and more recently, from newer assets that leverage our leadership position in oncology. We enter 2023 with even greater confidence that we're creating a sustainable engine that will bring forth innovation and generate value for both patients and shareholders over the long term.  Turning first to our results. The business is performing extremely well. The growth we've experienced in 2022 reflects a sustained track record of fundamental strength from our derisked key growth pillars. We begin the year with confidence that we'll maintain the strong underlying growth after taking into account the significant impact LAGEVRIO had during the height of the pandemic last year and are pleased to reflect this in our 2023 initial guidance.  Importantly, our pipeline is advancing with significant progress across several late-stage programs. In oncology, we have expansive research efforts, including our ambition to move treatment into earlier-stage settings where there is a higher potential for more favorable longer-term outcomes for patients.  In December, along with our partner, Moderna, we were pleased to announce highly encouraging Phase II results for our personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. We're excited by the potential that this combination may have for patients across a range of tumor types. And last week, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy, which Caroline and Dean will speak to.  In cardiovascular, we're exploring candidates across a broad range of diseases and have made substantial progress from just 1 year ago. At the American College of Cardiology conference, we will present data from the STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension and from the Phase II trial of MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, and we will also host an investor event to discuss these programs.  In vaccines, Instituto Butantan in Brazil, with whom we are collaborating for vaccine development, reported very encouraging top line results for their candidate for the prevention of dengue. These data will inform future development of our dengue vaccine, V181, and our efforts to address this critical public health challenge. Finally, through our business development efforts, we brought in 4 programs, which will have Phase III trial starts in 2023 and which have the opportunity to contribute meaningful growth during the latter half of this decade and into the next. We are following our disciplined approach to business development and will act when scientific opportunity and value aligned. We have more to do, but I feel very good about the progress we've made in 2022, and we believe that all of these efforts will lead to real benefits for patients and, in turn, for shareholders.  We enter 2023 with confidence in the innovation engine we are building and our ability to deliver sustainable value for patients well into the next decade. We will continue to execute on our derisked assets and act with urgency to advance and grow our pipeline. We are doing all of this with an approach to sustainability that is closely aligned to our overall business strategy. I'm very confident in the short and long-term outlook of our company, and I look forward to providing future updates.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, 2022 was an exceptional year for our company. We delivered excellent top line growth of 22%, driven by strength across our key pillars of oncology, vaccines and hospitals as well as the significant contribution from LAGEVRIO.   Our Animal Health business delivered strong operational growth, which was offset by foreign exchange. These results are a testament to the profound impact our medicines and vaccines are having on patients globally, which are enabled by our dedicated teams who are executing with excellence to deliver these important innovations. We are confident in the health of our business and in our outlook for continued strong underlying growth.  Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Excluding the effects from foreign exchange, the business delivered strong operational growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses continued their strong growth, increasing 9% and 6%, respectively.   Now turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.5 billion, driven by strong global demand for in-line indications as well as continued global expansion from new approvals. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continued to benefit from uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma.  KEYTRUDA continues to have a profound impact on patients, including in earlier-stage cancers where there is greater potential for better outcomes. We are excited by the recent approval of KEYNOTE-091, which represents KEYTRUDA's seventh indication in earlier-stage cancers. Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need. It is our ambition, along with others, to improve lung center screening rates to levels similar to other tumor types such as breast where screening programs with more routine.  While we are committed to addressing this unmet need, we anticipate a more gradual near-term uptake from this indication. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintains its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, which gives us confidence that we are well positioned to positively impact patients in the earlier setting.  Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in metastatic indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma as well as recent launches in earlier-stage cancers, including 30 types of high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma.  Lynparza maintained its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Alliance revenue grew 14%, primarily due to continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 9%, driven by increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer in the U.S. Lastly, WELIREG is performing in line with our expectations, and we are proud of the impact this is having on adult patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our vaccines portfolio delivered growth, with GARDASIL increasing 6% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. In the U.S., sales decreased primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccine sales also benefited from the pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which is off to an encouraging start, with revenues also benefiting from inventory stocking.  In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 7%, driven by an increase in market share amongst neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Hospital acute care sales also benefited from the resupply of the ZERBAXA, which started in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6%, reflecting strategic price actions and volume growth. Livestock sales grew 12%, driven by increased demand in ruminants and poultry products. Companion animal sales were negatively impacted by supply challenges for certain vaccines and a reduction in vet visits in October, which improved during the quarter.  I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Operating expenses increased 8% to $5.7 billion, reflecting increased investments to support our portfolio and growing pipeline. Other income was $86 million, reflecting the return on pension plan assets and capitalized interest, which was largely offset by net interest expense. Our tax rate was 15.6%. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.62.  Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The strength across our key pillars is expected to continue into this year. We project revenue to be between $57.2 billion and $58.7 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. Excluding the negative impact of LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates, we expect strong underlying revenue growth 7% to 10%. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 77%.  Operating expenses are assumed to be between $23.1 billion and $24.1 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of research and development expenses related to our acquisition of Imago and the expansion of our collaboration with Kelun-Biotech. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.  Other income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $6.80 to $6.95. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% using mid-January rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in continued strong growth across oncology, vaccines and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. On revenues, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. Global immunization levels remain low, which creates a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients. And we are improving supply, which positions us well to support the significant demand we are experiencing today and expect over the long term for this vaccine that prevents HPV-related cancers. Other revenue is projected to decline significantly, primarily reflecting a smaller planned benefit from revenue hedges following the U.S. dollar strength last year, which resulted in an approximate $800 million benefit in 2022. Other revenue is also expected to be lower due to the discontinuation of third-party manufacturing sales to Johnson and Johnson.  On the rest of the P&L, we project the shift from other expense to other income, which is primarily attributable to an assumption that there will be no pension settlement costs as well as an expectation of lower net interest expense and higher joint venture equity income. This benefit is more than offset by an increase in the estimated tax rate due to the unfavorable impact of the R&D capitalization provision as well as an approximate 1 percentage point impact related to Imago.  Now shifting to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are excited about the significant progress our teams have made to advance and augment our pipeline in 2022.  In 2023, we will continue to invest in opportunities that will address important unmet medical needs and drive the next wave of growth for our company, including the initiation of many late-stage clinical trials across a broad set of novel candidates. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of increasing it over time.  We will continue to pursue the most compelling external science through value-enhancing business development to augment our internal pipeline, and we'll invest appropriately maximize the potential of our program. Given the strength of our business and balance sheet, we plan to resume share repurchases, while ensuring we maintain ample capacity to pursue additional business development, which is the higher priority.  To conclude, we entered 2023 confident in our ability to execute on the important opportunities we have to deliver innovation to patients and sustain the strong underlying growth of our business well into the future.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Thank you, Caroline. Today, I will provide notable updates since our last earnings call. We continue to make significant advancements and achieve important regulatory milestones. The fourth quarter marks the end of a successful year with progress made across oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases and cardiology.  Let me start with oncology. We remain committed to transforming the landscape of cancer therapy with an ongoing focus on treating earlier stages of disease. We are pleased by the recent approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with stage Ib, II or IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of KEYNOTE-091. This approval provides, for the very first time, an adjuvant immunotherapy option for this patient population with stage 1b disease and regardless of PD-L1 status.  Beyond KEYNOTE-091, we have additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer, including: KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant therapy in resectable stage II, IIIa and IIIb disease; KEYNOTE-867 evaluating KEYTRUDA in patients undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy with unresected stage I or II disease; and KEYLYNK-012 studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage III disease.  These trials are all part of our broader effort to treat earlier stages of cancer and further improve patient outcomes across, tumor types, such as melanoma. Together with Moderna, we announced positive Phase II results for V940, mRNA-4157 in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of stage III and IV for melanoma in patients with high risk of recurrence following complete resection. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in recurrence free survival versus KEYTRUDA alone. This investigational personalized neoantigen therapy utilizes mRNA technology and is specifically tailored to target the unique mutational signature of each patient's tumor. We plan to discuss the results with regulators and initiate Phase III trials in multiple tumors this year. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.  We also announced positive results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-966 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy. This trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer.   In addition, we announced positive top line results from the Phase III KEYNOTE-859 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.  In November, we announced the acquisition of Imago BioSciences, which closed last month. Imago's lead candidate, bomedemstat, is a potentially first-in-class orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.  The combined team is now focused on continuing to advance the ongoing clinical development programs. At the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, data were presented from multiple pipeline candidates, including: favezelimab, our anti-LAG3 antibody; zilovertamab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, targeting ROR-1; and nemtabrutinib, our oral reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor; as well as KEYTRUDA. Updated Phase II data for bomedemstat in essential thrombocythemia and advanced myelofibrosis were also presented.  We continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. In the European Union, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we announced the approval for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROpel trial. In China, based on the results of KEYNOTE-522 and KEYNOTE 394 in we received approvals for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant/adjuvant high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively.  With our partners, Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA has accepted supplemental biologic license application for KEYTRUDA with PADCEV, an antibody drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, for the first-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The agency set a PDUFA date of April 21, 2023, for each application.  Building on the clinical benefits observed with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and antibody drug conjugates, we have focused on augmenting our tissue targeting candidates through business development. We announced the expansion of our agreement with Kelun-Biotech with the addition of up to 7 preclinical antibody drug conjugates.  The collaboration leverages technology with the potential to yield a new generation of candidates designed to precisely target and deliver potent anticancer agents to the tumor site. This follows previously disclosed agreement for 2 clinical stage candidates, including MK-2870, an investigational TROP2 targeting ADC we are planning to advance into Phase III trials this year. We also expanded our collaboration with PeptiDream to include the discovery and development of peptide drug conjugates. This technology potentially provides for improved permeability and drug selectivity in targeting tumor tissue. Next to our vaccine portfolio. We were encouraged by the progress scientists and clinicians at the Instituto Butantan in Brazil made in developing a single dose dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Brazil. We are collaborating with the team there to conduct a detailed analysis of these positive topline Phase III results to determine next steps for our own dengue vaccine candidate, V181, currently in Phase II development. Merck’s goal is to make V181 available outside of Brazil for populations at risk for dengue. As Caroline noted, we are receiving positive feedback from the field regarding the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting, and remain confident in our population specific strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. VAXNEUVANCE offers strong protection, including in the first year of life, with robust immunity across all shared and unique serotypes. This is important because the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is greatest in the first year of life for children. Also, we are on track and look forward to the Phase III results from our V116 program for the protection of adults this year.  We, along with others in the industry, are making a real impact in our goal to help reduce cancer incidence. It was noteworthy that the American Cancer Society’s recently published annual report on cancer facts and trends included the remarkable observation that there has been a 65 percent reduction in cervical cancer incidence in women 20 to 24 years old, from 2012 through 2019.  It is this type of finding that further reinforces Merck’s commitment to bringing forward treatment and prevention options to help patients with this devastating disease. As part of this commitment, we are encouraged by the role GARDASIL continues to play in helping to prevent certain HPV-related cervical cancers. Turning to the broader portfolio. With the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce the incidence of disease and burden on healthcare systems. We were pleased LAGEVRIO was granted conditional marketing authorization by China's National Medical Products Administration in December, for use in adult patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and a high risk of progressing to severe cases.  I wish to reinforce something Rob mentioned. Please mark your calendars for March 6, where we will present detailed findings of the Phase III STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Phase II results for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans.  We will also host a live investor event to answer your questions. We look forward to bringing sotatercept as an important treatment option to patients and are currently working towards submission of the data from the STELLAR trial. We are in discussions with the FDA about submission of the data on a rolling basis, which is likely to result in a potential approval in early 2024. As we close out 2022, it is important to highlight that over the course of the year we made strong progress across therapeutic areas, modalities, stages of development and multiple business development transactions.  In oncology, we obtained several important regulatory approvals globally for KEYTRUDA, and Lynparza as well as advanced a number of programs evaluating earlier stage cancer regimens. In vaccines, we received an important approval in pediatrics for VAXNEUVANCE. In addition, we were granted expanded authorizations in China, and active recommendations were reinstated in Japan for GARDASIL. In HIV, we resumed our clinical development program for islatravir. And finally in cardiovascular disease, we made significant progress across our pulmonary arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia programs.  Taken together, we continue to deliver on our strategy of advancing promising candidates across multiple therapeutic areas. We have strong momentum across our pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our progress in 2023.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Thanks, Dean. Kelly, we're ready to take questions now. We intend to end the call at 9:00 sharp this morning. [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Maybe just you made some comments around sort of uptake in the adjuvant setting after the most recent label update. Can you maybe just sort of set expectations there? And does that comment reflect any sort of assumptions around when we might see mature data from the PEARLE study potentially this year? Yes. So I believe you're speaking about KEYNOTE-091. So I just want to take a broad view and then the today view and the tomorrow view. So I would just count that the American Cancer Society in 2023, it's really remarkable. They suggest that for between 1991 and 2023, there's a massive reduction in lung cancer of 58%, 36%, and KEYTRUDA has been critical in that story.  And now we're moving to early lung. The label is broad. It is regardless of PD-L1, and it reflects the clinical trial, where we demonstrated a 27% reduction. We're pushing into these earlier lines with other trials. But I think for -- what we need to set for is 2 things. We need to make it much more easier, with scientific innovation, other means to get subcu -- to get KEYTRUDA. And that's why we're very eager to push our subcu pembrolizumab with [indiscernible] into Phase III this year. But we also need to do a lot to improve adherence to established guidelines, which currently only have 6% or so of individuals actually who should be screened, being screened in the United States.  So I think with that, we have work to do in relationship to really taking this important advance and making it broadly available through to individuals who should be getting screened, screened. So Carter, maybe I can just add on a little bit about the commercial opportunity. As Dean said, this will be a slower ramp because we have to drive more people to get diagnosed early so that we can get them the care they need.  But just to give you some sizing of this. If you look at 2023, there are about 230,000 people who were diagnosed with lung cancer in U.S. And the majority of that group was not diagnosed until they were in the metastatic setting. So if you think about it from a minority perspective, we would estimate about 120,000 people in the early-stage setting, of which only 1/4 will have a section -- or have surgery and be in the stage Ib through IIIa, which is what our label indicates.  So you're looking at about 30,000 patients who would be the addressable population. And then obviously, of that group, historically, only about half of those patients have gone on to receive treatment in the form of chemotherapy or IO. So that's obviously something we hope to change as we go forward because we think the outcome will show that if you are resected, you should pursue KEYTRUDA in that setting. And it's our goal over time not only to drive more patients in that segment, but obviously, the more people we can get diagnosed early pre-metastatic, then actually we will expand the population over time.  So we see this as a meaningful opportunity long term, but it's going to take us time to ramp as we work to change the paradigm that's existed in the past. Thank you, Carter. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question is going to come from Andrew Baum from Citi. A couple of questions. Could you please address the demand on Merck's business to plug the hole associated with the KEYTRUDA LOE post-2028? Alternatively, instead, just build the exit growth rate and focus less on finding revenues to plug the hole as you think about your BD strategy. And perhaps quickly for Dean, could you just give us some guidance on the timing for the PFS analysis and the PD-L1 high, greater-than-50 cohort from KEYVIBE-003. Should we expect it in the next 12 months? I know the total PFS read for the whole trial is somewhere in '24, but it strikes me you may have a separate analysis for that greater-than-50 subgroup. Great. Well, maybe, Andrew, I'll start off, and if Caroline or Dean want to jump in. But to give you a sense -- and obviously, we haven't given specific guidance to the LOE period. But just to ground everyone in the facts, KEYTRUDA and our expectation will lose exclusivity in the United States in 2028 and in China in 2028. It loses it in Europe in 2030 and in Japan in 2032.  So obviously, by shorthand, we refer to '28, but the reality of it is over most of the markets, and KEYTRUDA increasingly is becoming obvious, as you know, a global product. It's spread out. But as we look at where we sit today, I would say we feel good about the progress we've made. We're confident that we're on a path to sustainable growth into the next decade. Obviously, we have more work to do, but I would just point you to a few proof points that I think support that.  First of all, as we talked about in the last 18 months, we've made meaningful progress in our cardiovascular pipeline, we have 8 potential approvals between 2025 and 2030, obviously. The centerpiece of that is sotatercept and what we're seeing from the STELLAR data, which really was just quite phenomenal. If you look at that, we expect those products, that portfolio of opportunity on an unrisk-adjusted basis to be in excess of $10 billion as you approach the mid-2030s. We recently discussed the fact that through the business development deals we've done, we've brought in new assets apart from KEYTRUDA, apart from Lynparza, Lenvima and WELIREG, that themselves, these new mechanisms, I would point you to things like ORION and Imago. Those products, along with what we see in the ADC space, as a portfolio, we think themselves have the potential for $10 billion or more of revenue as you get into the early to mid-2030s.  So today, we sit there with the expectation that we are starting to make meaningful progress, and that excludes all the work we're doing to bring an incremental value to patients on KEYTRUDA. Obviously, as great as KEYTRUDA is, it still only has an overall response rate averaging around 30%.  We need to deepen and drive better response. We're looking to do that through combinations and through other means to find ways to improve on KEYTRUDA. We're looking to continue to expand into new tumor types as well and clearly move into earlier lines of therapy where we believe we can start to move to a point that we can actually give people an extension of life and hopefully, someday get to a point that we talk about cancer as chronic disease, not a fatal disease. Obviously, we have more to do there. But that is the aspiration. And we have a lot of efforts underway to do that, through what we're doing in IO combinations, IO ADC combinations with our subcutaneous offering.  And then obviously, we're very excited recently about the deal we did with Moderna for the personalized cancer vaccine, which is really a therapeutic that we think, in combination with KEYTRUDA, while we're studying it first in melanoma obviously, we believe, has the potential to move into broader tumor. So that in and of itself gives us a lot of confidence. And we're doing similar activities with Lynparza with Lenvima and obviously, WELIREG is in its early days.  So if you look at the total of that, and I have even gotten into our vaccines portfolio and what we see as excitement there, we feel like we've made a lot of progress. We have more to do, but that's why you hear me talk more about how do we build the sustainable engine to drive growth well into the next decade. And that really should be our focus point because I'm confident if we do that well, the LOE of KEYTRUDA will take care of itself. So Dean? Yes. So there was a question on our TIGIT program, KEYTRUDA plus TIGIT. Just to remind everyone, we have 9 ongoing trials. We have 5 Phase IIIs. In fact, just recently in December, we opened up KEYVIBE-10, which is Phase III and in early melanoma. In relationship to KEYVIBE-003, which I think is the question, we added the TPS greater than 50% as an endpoint, these are event driven. And as the events drive to statistically and clinically meaningful data, we'll announce it appropriately. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. I would love for you to talk to what might make MK-2870 a better TROP2 targeting ADC versus those that we've seen from Gilead and Astra and Daiichi? Also, do you still believe that it's too difficult to combine an ADC plus IO in a fixed dose combination? Yes. So let me just state, we'll be starting a whole series of Phase III trials this year. I really appreciate your question. For me, the critical thing is whether it be an ADC or whether it be a RAS inhibitor in solid tumors, especially as you want to advance them in solid tumors where IO has been important, the combination benefit of the 2 becomes really important.  So we're very excited to be pushing forward our TROP2 ADC. I can get into the details of the molecules, on the linkers and the payloads and the DARs. But really, the better sort of thing is I believe that this year, we will be presenting our Phase II studies. And at the end of the day, that will be the most convincing data to provide to you as to why we think we have an important play with our TROP2 ADC, but it's also the play of that TROP2 ADC in relationship to adding it to an IO agent. We think that is an important considerations when thinking about any cancer-killing mechanism in solid tumors. Great. Thank you, Evan. Next question please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. So wanted to know how you're thinking about your Phase III trial design for your oral PCSK9? And how will that design really highlight the competitive advantages of your product? Thank you very much. So first, I don't want to get ahead too much of our March 6 Investor Meeting where we're least showing the data that we have in relationship to the oral PCSK9 and sotatercept.  I will just sort of emphasize what we're trying to accomplish. And what we're trying to accomplish is we are trying to accomplish the most potent LDL lowering oral pill for lowering cholesterol. There should be no co-chain, there should be very little need to interact with the health care system, which makes it reach very easy and very accessible, not just in the U.S. but globally. And we need to do it at a price point of what I would call a branded oral medicine would be, not a -- in order to maximize the access.  In relationship with Phase III, there's a general set sort of view of how that is. One is you would drive it because LDL lowering is such a clean biomarker, so that's something. But one would also have to, at the same time, drive towards outcomes, which is also going to be important. So our Phase III trial design is informed by what the history of the field has been and what the FDA's regulatory sort of outline comes in for others. Great. Thank you, Louise. Next question, please, Kelly. Next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. If I could ask you a question on V940, the cancer vaccine. What tumor types outside of melanoma do you already have any positive human data and even if those are earlier stage? And if you don't have any human data in non-melanoma tumor types, can you talk about animal data? I'm trying to obviously think about what Phase III trials you may be starting in 2023 with that product. Thank you very much. So you're speaking about the wonderful partnership that we have with Moderna in the personalized cancer vaccine. I just want to preface everything. What we've released is top line data in melanoma. That data will be presented sometime in the near term where we present the data that we have for melanoma. And we have work to do to move that into Phase III.  So we have a lot of work to do just in melanoma. I'm not going to speak ahead of what human data we have outside of that. But I would say 2 things that are really important. One is one can watch which of the tumors have sensitivity to an immune approach. And one can watch about the clinical development with KEYTRUDA to sort of map out where you would think about doing that.  The second issue that I would emphasize is that when we're talking about an IO-IO strategy, which often people speak about, I view this personalized neoantigen therapy as an IO-IO strategy with KEYTRUDA. And the reason I want to emphasize that is there is a view that we are beginning to develop that IO-IO strategies may be especially useful in early cancer stages. And you see that in our interest in our combination projects related to checkpoint inhibitors, but also in relationship to personalized neoantigen therapy.  And so we think that, that's -- around that, we are going to advance. And the critical component for us to be able to advance that is to advance KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy in indications because it creates us to actually do these clinical trials. Great. Thank you, Tim. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Geoff from Bank of America. Dean, on subcu KEYTRUDA, can you talk about the cadence of data this year and what you're ultimately looking for from a risk/benefit perspective as you evaluate different technologies? And Rob, I wasn't sure where this program ranks on kind of your strategic priorities across IO. So thank you very much for that question. I think it's on -- we'll be -- when we talk about starting 10 to 15 Phase III clinical trials, just in oncology, this subcu program is a critical component to that. And we will be starting those Phase III this year. What are we seeking to achieve? I've talked about the early cancer space. The early cancer space, I think, is really important just from a medical standpoint of where we can impact really the outcomes of patients, we can markedly improve that.  If you're going to go in the early space, whether it's neoadjuvant or adjuvant, from my clinical training, working with lung cancer doctors and oncologists, our ability to limit the need for individuals to constantly come to infusion centers is very important. And we need to have the scientific innovation to do that.  In doing that, we have to think carefully about how do we give as much optionality Q 3 weeks, Q weeks in that subcu regimen, and that's what we're trying to drive through in our Phase III trials. Rob, did you want to answer anything else? No, I appreciate the question, Jeff. I think Dean covered it well. This is a very important part of our overall strategy as we think about moving into earlier lines of therapy and then to drive convenience and access for patients, which is -- it's very important. So it's meaningful and it's something we're going to pursue as fast as we can. Thanks, Geoff. Next question, please, Kelly. Next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. I think I have a big-picture question regarding IO-IO combinations and the development strategy there. Because the common criticism is that many of these big Phase III studies were started with -- after less-than-robust Phase II data, and that's why they failed to show benefit in Phase III.  I mean looking at your data in Phase II, they are single-arm data as well. So can you just help us understand what gives you confidence that this is the right strategy to move forward? And wouldn't it be better to do some kind of Phase II trial where you have pembro as a control? Yes. Thank you very much. I'll just emphasize that as a general rule, the way that I have begun to develop my view of IO-IO strategies is that IO-IO strategies are very important to pursue. I think that IO-IO strategies plus other therapies that kill cancers may be especially important in the metastatic. But IO-IO strategies in the early stage could be quite impactful.  And so as I've just said, we have advanced our IO-IO strategy. We've advanced it with TIGIT CTLA-4 and LAG-3, so another component part. But I would just say that I don't know that there's 1 single addition to KEYTRUDA that will have the breadth of KEYTRUDA, so we've been a little bit selective there.  And I think the movement of IO-IO, not just in the metastatic space but especially in the early space will become important. And the ability to do that requires your first IO of that IO-IO to be approved in the early space. And that is why we are so excited about moving into earlier spaces with KEYTRUDA, because that allows us to execute in an IO-IO strategy in early-stage cancers. Thanks, Mohit. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. I think you mentioned that you're looking to review share repo. And it does seem like maybe, Rob, some of your recent business development commentary has been skewed towards smaller deals or collaboration. So can you all just put into context what you view as an appropriate level of leverage for Merck? And should we be thinking about kind of the cash generation beyond that level as maybe going towards repo going forward?  And let me just slip a really quick second one. Just help me on FX. I think you were talking about a 2% headwind. Most of your peers aren't seeing much given the recent weakening of the dollar. Are there any currencies that stand out we should be keeping in mind there? So Chris, this is Caroline. First to talk to share repurchase. As we've stated previously, it's our goal as a company to deploy our cash, first and foremost, behind the business opportunities we have within the company as well as augment that with business development. We have turned on the share repurchase program, given the strength of our business and our balance sheet. But we'll be ensuring we have ample capacity to pursue business development, which is the highest priority and is a better generator of growth and value creation.  We have a portfolio of BDs that we are reviewing, and we will continue to do so and hope to have news that we'll be sharing in the future. So priority remains BD, invest in the business, but to the extent there is excess cash, we will return that to shareholders through the share buybacks. We will maintain an appropriate leverage for our company. We are very comfortable operating at the credit rating we are at, and would expect to sustain that kind of level as we go forward.  From a foreign exchange perspective, in 2022, we were extremely successful as a company in blunting the impact of foreign exchange with our revenue hedging program. The underlying impact of foreign exchange to our business in 2022 was approximately 6% on the top line, 10% on the bottom line. But with our effective hedging program, which brought revenue on the other revenue line of approximately $800 million, that blunted the impact to 4% on the top and 4% on the bottom.  As you rightly note, as we look at 2023, we expect the underlying impact of foreign exchange to be around 1 percentage point on the top and the bottom line. What is impacting the guidance that we've given is we obviously don't expect as significant hedge gains in 2023, which means that the overall impact from foreign exchange year-over-year is expected to be 2% on the top and 4% on the bottom. Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. I know you guys typically don't give product level guidance, Caroline, but I was wondering if you can speak at a high level about your vaccine franchise this year. Obviously, you have new capacity coming out for GARDASIL, but you also talked about the pediatric opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE. So just wondering how we should think about those this year.  And then 1 follow-up for Dean on sotatercept. I know you're talking to the FDA now. Are you still confident that, that single trial will be sufficient for approval? Or is there a possibility you could need data from the other ongoing studies? Thank you for the question. So the guidance that we've provided for 2023 is underpinned by very strong revenue growth of 7% to 10% when you exclude the impact of LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange. The drivers of that growth are our key pillars of oncology, where we expect continued impact to patients and growth, given the portfolio of indications we have in KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, Lenvima.  Vaccines, as you rightly note, driven by an acceleration expected in the growth of GARDASIL as we have new supply coming online as well as an acceleration in our VAXNEUVANCE performance, especially given the strong data we have for the pediatric setting.  And we expect continued growth, strong growth in our Animal Health business. There are some headwinds against that, that we've talked about with LAGEVRIO, with foreign exchange and with an increased level of pricing expected, especially in Europe with the changes to the BPA Scheme that U.K. and AMNOG in Germany. But overall, very confident in the underlying growth of our business anchored to oncology, vaccines and Animal Health. Yes. So again, March 6, clinical trial data for sotatercept will be more fully discussed. I think it will be very impactful data. And I have no indication at this point that we will need a readout from any other trial from a clinical standpoint to support our filing to the FDA for sotatercept. Thank you, Terence. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow of UBS. I guess I'll piggyback on a couple of the others. On TIGIT, we've obviously seen some competitive data recently, and then we have some Phase III competitor readout this year. Just what is your level of enthusiasm for this class currently? And just what underpins that in terms of the data we've seen? And then just second on GARDASIL, are you able to give any more granularity on the timing and levels of additional supply that will be coming online with respect to the new manufacturing facility? Yes. Well, thank you for that question. In relationship to TIGIT, I mean, we're very confident in our molecule. As I've said, we have 9 ongoing, 5 Phase III trials pushing the boundaries of what pembro can do or PD-1 can do with another IO agent has been something that's very important for the field. And the way that I can simply answer your question about the confidence in the molecule is we just opened an additional KEYVIBE study, a Phase III study in the earlier stages of cancer for this IO-IO combination. And for GARDASIL, we, as you know, have driven productivity in the existing manufacturing facilities we have. And we have 2 new facilities coming online over the course of '23, '24. So it will be a progressive ramp, but I'll reiterate we're expecting an acceleration in our growth during 2023. Great. Thank you, Colin. Next question, please, Kelly. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. There was a story in New York Times last week, which mentioned Merck has a patent estate of 180 patents on KEYTRUDA. And I'm curious, since your 10-K only points to the earliest patent expiry date of 2028, can you speak to the types of patents encompassed in this 180 patent estate? And is it reasonable to assume that your true patent estate on KEYTRUDA goes well past 2035? Yes. So I would just want to elevate the question a little bit. The focus of what we're trying to do is we're trying to drive the concept of inhibition of checkpoint inhibitors can really have a profound effect throughout cancers in all stages, in all tumor types. We talk about expand into different tissue types and stages, deepen in combination and extend with routes of delivery, roots of [ administration ] and frequency.  And these innovations are critically important to make sure that this life-saving sort of treatment is available. And we are confident in those innovations providing benefit to patients. And we have filed, where appropriate, intellectual property for it, for that. Thank you, Umer. Last question, please, Kelly. Our last question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Novartis said yesterday that it believes the treatment of cardiovascular disease is moving towards infrequently administered injectables as opposed to orals, citing very poor compliance with orals. They probably have a good point because the Merck PCSK9 could be associated with GI issues and other issues, which may make oral delivery a challenge. So I assume you disagree. Is that because indeed, your oral PCSK9 is very well tolerated and clean? Or do you disagree for other reasons? We'll be talking about the detailed data from the PCSK9. We believe that it's very clean. But I'll just step back, as a cardiologist who trained in the late '80s and 1990s, the ability to have an oral drug that lowered LDL cholesterol was impactful for the world.  Yes, every oral drug, regardless of what therapy it is, has a compliance, so it's very important to maintain compliance. What we're trying to do is to create the most potent LDL cholesterol lowering pill ever made that does not require, does not require constant interactions with a health care system. We think that, that axis is actually one that's very important, not just in the U.S., but also globally.  And this is personally speaking, as someone who practice this early, as recently as 5 years ago. If I had an oral PCSK9 LDL lowering pill back then, I would be prescribing it with the other 3 to 4 oral pills that I'm prescribing an individual. Thank you, Steve, and thank you, everybody, for your thoughtful questions. Please follow up with me and the IR team if you have anything additional, and we look forward to staying in touch. Take care. That concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."

         "Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Honeywell Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Sean Meakim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings and 2023 Outlook Conference Call. On the call with me today are Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Lewis; President and Chief Operating Officer, Vimal Kapur; and Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Anne Madden. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor. Honeywell also uses our website as a means of disclosing information which may be of interest or material to our investors and for complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor our Investor Relations website in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, webcasts and social media.

Those elements can change based on many factors, including changing economic and business conditions, and we ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning, we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 and discuss our 2023 outlook, including sharing our guidance for the first quarter of 2023 and full year 2023. As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Darius Adamczyk. Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 2. The fourth quarter was another challenging one with supply chain constraints and inflation headwinds still at play. But Honeywell's disciplined execution and differentiated solutions enable us to deliver on organic sales, segment margins, earnings and free cash flow commitments. Organic sales were up 10% year-over-year or up 11% excluding the impact of the wind-down of operations in Russia led by double-digit growth in commercial aviation, building products, advanced materials and UOP businesses, a testament to the underlying strength we're seeing across our end markets, particularly in long-cycle businesses. The fourth quarter was another strong one for our backlog, which grew to a new record of $29.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to strength in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies. Orders were also a positive story in Aero and PMT, leading to a 2% organic orders growth and 6% sequential growth in the fourth quarter. The tailwinds we'll continue to see in these 2 businesses gives us confidence in our 2023 outlook, which Greg and Vimal will share more detail about in a few minutes. Our segment margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year, led by over 900 basis points of expansion in safety and productivity solutions as volumes improve and we continue to stay ahead with the inflation curve through our strategic pricing actions. Excluding the year-over-year impact of our investment in Quantinuum, the margin expansion was 180 basis points. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter with 125% adjusted conversion, down 18% year-over-year but delivering in line with our original guidance for the year. Capital deployment in the fourth quarter was $2.3 billion, including $1.4 billion of share repurchases, bringing our full year total to $4.2 billion in shares repurchased and exceeding our goal of $4 billion from our March Investor Day. For the full year 2022, we delivered outstanding results above the high end of our initial guidance for segment margin and adjusted earnings per share despite approximately $2 billion in year-over-year top line headwinds and constantly shifting macroeconomic conditions.  We finished the year with 6% organic sales growth, 70 basis points of margin expansion and $8.76 of adjusted earnings per share, up 9% year-over-year and above the top end of our original $8.70 guide. Orders ended the year up 8% on an organic basis, and our backlog reached an all-time high of $29.6 billion. We generated $4.9 billion of cash in the year, 14% of our revenue. The appendix of this presentation contains a slide highlighting our guidance progression through 2022 as well as our performance against these guides. Capital deployment for 2022 was $7.9 billion in total, in addition to the $4.2 billion in share repurchases, which lowered our weighted average share count by 2.5%. We deployed $800 million to high-return capital expenditures and $200 million on closing the acquisition of US Digital Designs. Finally, we maintained our dividend growth policy, paying out $2.7 billion and raising our dividend for the 13th time in 12 years. As always, we continue to execute on our proven value-creation framework, which is underpinned by our Accelerator operating system. I am confident in the strength of our backlog and the tailwinds we're seeing across our end markets, and I'm proud of our ability to execute and drive shareowner value through the current challenging environment. Now let's turn to Slide 3 to discuss an important development from the fourth quarter, which further improved our company's strength for the future. In the fourth quarter, we announced the final court approval of our buyout agreement with the NARCO Trust, providing the elimination of our funding obligations in exchange for our $1.325 billion cash payment to the trust. This liability has been weighing on our balance sheet since 2002, one of the numbers of legacy liabilities the company has been carefully managing. We recognized the charge from the buyout in the fourth quarter, and the cash outflow took place in January. Partially offsetting the impact of the buyout is the sale of HarbisonWalker International, the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the NARCO bankruptcy, which announced that and will be acquired from the trust by private equity firm, Platinum Equity. We expect this transaction to be completed later in 2023, reducing the net free cash flow impact by approximately $300 million. This development represents a significant improvement in our financial strength. Specifically, it simplifies our balance sheet by eliminating our evergreen funding obligations, eliminates quarterly asbestos charges related to NARCO and extinguishes any further uncertainty on our company's financial health. Now let me turn over to Vimal to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail on Slide 4. Thank you, Darius, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4. As Darius mentioned, we continue to deliver on our financial commitments despite a very challenging operating environment. In the fourth quarter, sales grew 10% organically with double-digit growth in 3 of our 4 SBGs: HPT, PMT and Aero. We generated volume improvement from third quarter in Aero and HBT despite continued supply chain constraints. As expected, we are seeing some signs of demand weakness in pockets of our shorter-cycle businesses in SPS and HBT, but demand across our long-cycle portfolio remains robust with the exception of warehouse automation as evidenced by 2% organic growth in orders and 7% growth in backlog. Supply chain remains a constraint on our overall growth, but we are encouraged by another quarter of sequential volume improvement in Aero as output expanded by double digits in 4Q. Alongside solid organic growth came robust segment margin expansion of 150 basis point year-over-year to nearly 23% as our investment in Honeywell Digital enabled us to make a nimble and surgical approach to staying ahead of price/cost. While SPS was the lone segment to experience a decline in revenue year-over-year, the business also generated the most profitable quarter in its history, which we will discuss in more detail shortly. Let's spend a few minutes on the fourth quarter performance by business. Aerospace. Sales for the fourth quarter were up 11% organically year-over-year led by 23% growth in commercial aviation. This marks the second consecutive quarter of double-digit Aerospace organic sales growth and the seventh straight for commercial aviation, which gives us confidence despite the state of the Aero supply chain over the past 2 years. Supply chain remains a gating factor to volume growth, though we made a further progress this quarter with a factory output up 15% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Our past-due backlog grew an accelerated pace in the fourth quarter, but this was more driven by the strength of inbound orders. Growth was highest in Commercial OE, where increased ship-set deliveries led to 25% sales growth year-over-year. Commercial aero aftermarket sales were up 20% in the fourth quarter as increased flight hours resulted in higher spare shipments and repair and overhaul activity. While defense volumes continued to be in the lower on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter, our order rates remained strong, up high single digits for the quarter and mid-single digit for the year, giving us positive momentum for 2023. Aero segment margins contracted 120 basis point to 27.8% due to higher sales of lower-margin OE products, partially offset by our commercial excellence efforts. Building Technologies delivered another outstanding quarter with 15% organic sales growth year-over-year. Modest improvement in supply chain enabled us to reduce our past-due backlog sequentially and deliver more fire products and building management systems, resulting in 21% organic growth in building products. However, supply chains still have not fully unlocked. We exited 2022 with higher past D-U-E backlogs than we entered the year and considerably higher levels than our pre-COVID norms. Building solutions sales also increased organically with double-digit organic growth in project sales for the third consecutive quarter. We finished the year with higher project backlog levels than the start of the year, providing a solid runway for 2023. Our continued commercial excellence in this inflationary environment enabled us to expand HBT segment margins 370 basis point to 24.8%, substantial progress nearly reaching our long-term margin target of 25%. Performance Materials and Technologies sales grew 15% organically in fourth quarter despite a 4% headwind from Russia. Advanced materials grew 20% organically in the quarter as we continued to see robust value capture across the portfolio and demand in Fluorine products. The quarter was the fourth consecutive quarter where advanced materials led PMT growth. UOP grew 13% organically, overcoming 9% headwind year-over-year from lost Russia sales. Growth in UOP was led by refining catalyst shipments, and we also saw a double-digit sales increase in Sustainable Technology Solutions. Process technology returned to growth in the quarter as a result of strong gas processing demand. Process Solution also grew double digit in the quarter with a strength across the portfolio, led by thermal solutions, lifecycle solution and services and projects.  In late 2022, weather freeze caused some operational challenges at one of our plants, reducing output in the quarter. PMT orders once again grew organically in the fourth quarter, underpinned by strength in Fluorine products. Segment margins contracted 100 basis point in the quarter to 22% driven by cost inflation and higher sales of lower-margin products, partially offset by our commercial excellence efforts. Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased 5% organically in the quarter, in line with our expectation, as continued growth in sensing portion of sensing and safety technology business was offset by lower volume in warehouse automation and productivity solution and services. While Intelligrated volumes declined overall, our aftermarket services business saw another quarter of double-digit growth. PSS continues to see some demand moderation from macroeconomic conditions, but we remain confident in our differentiated solutions. Segment margin was a standout for SPS with expansion of 940 basis point to 20.2%, our highest ever in this business due to commercial excellence, improved sales mix, and productivity actions more than offsetting lower volume leverage and cost inflation headwinds. Growth across portfolio continues to be supported by accretive results in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. We had another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, including over 20% growth in our recurring and SaaS business year-over-year. Cyber, Sparta Systems and Connected Building all grew by more than 35% year-over-year in the quarter. For the full year, [ SC ] sales and profit both grew by double digit, which is an indicator of the power of a strong software franchise. Overall, this is a great operational result for Honeywell. Adjusted earning per share in the fourth quarter grew 21% to $2.52, $0.01 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Segment margin drove 29% of year-over-year improvement in earnings per share, the main driver of our year-over-year growth. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed 10% of improvement and reduced share count added an additional $0.07. A bridge for adjusted EPS from 4Q '21 to 4Q '22 can be found in appendix of this presentation. Moving to cash. We generated $2.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down 18% year-over-year but delivering the midpoint of our full year free cash flow guidance at $4.9 billion. Cash continued to be challenged by higher receivables and inventory as we continue to work through the supply-constrained environment as well as $200 million headwind from Garrett receipt in the fourth quarter of 2021. So overall, Honeywell's rigorous operating principles allowed us to manage successfully through another challenging quarter as we close our 2022. Now let's turn to Slide 5 to talk about where we expect to see across our end markets and the broader macro environment in 2023. Looking ahead to 2023, we see a continuation of many of the challenges we faced in 2022. But we also see ongoing progress in our key initiative to unlock more volume from our supply chain in order to meet very robust demand in several of our key end markets. Commercial Aerospace will continue to be a standout in terms of demand, both build rates amongst our OEM customers as well as aftermarket flight hours, particularly as widebody makes a more meaningful contribution on its way back to normalization. Alongside that strong demand profile, we expect steady progress of the Aero supply chain in 2022 to continue in 2023. As a result, we expect acceleration in Aero's top line growth compared to 2022, potentially achieving low double digits. We continue -- we see continued tailwinds for investment in Sustainable Building Solutions, particularly through institutional channels as well in the production of both current and future energy supply as evidenced by strength in orders across both sustainable building technologies and sustainable technology solutions, including green fuels. We expect a moderation in raw material inflation but for it to remain at elevated levels. Coupled with a gradual improvement in supply chain, we should see more of a balance between volume and price to drive our top line growth in 2023. Our order growth of 2% decelerated in the fourth quarter compared to 8% for the full year but remained in positive territory, including sequential growth from the third quarter for Aero, PMT and SPS. Our backlog of almost $30 billion remains at record levels, growing 7% year-over-year in fourth quarter. We reduced our positive backlog in all SBGs except Aero for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting supply chain loosening and the effects of effort to mitigate part shortages. The current macroeconomic uncertainty is giving some customers pause amongst our short-cycle businesses in SPS and HBT, and there's a lot of near-term uncertainty regarding how the reversal of China's Zero COVID policy will impact 1Q, particularly the potential impact of Chinese New Year, though this may be a tailwind in the second half. As discussed on the third quarter call, lower noncash pension income is a headwind to EPS growth in 2023, but our underlying segment profit growth continues to look robust. Underpinning our expectation is the confidence we have in our continued operational execution, underpinned by our operating system called Honeywell Accelerator. We'll manage through another challenging operational environment with the rigor you have come to expect from us. Now let me turn it over to Greg as we move to Slide 6 to discuss in more detail how these dynamics come together for our 2023 financial guidance. Thanks, Vimal, and good morning, everyone. Given the backdrop Vimal just shared, in total for 2023, we expect sales of $36 billion to $37 billion, which represents an overall organic growth sales range of 2% to 5% for the year. While we'll continue to drive pricing actions where needed to offset the impact of cost inflation, we expect more balance between the contributions of volume and price in 2022. Similar to last year, we believe the first half of the year will be slower as supply chains improve sequentially throughout the year and potential headwinds from the reversal of zero COVID policies in China are strongest in the first quarter. In Aerospace, the demand backdrop remains very encouraging in both commercial aviation and defense and space. In the commercial aftermarket, we expect continued flight-hour growth, particularly in widebody as international borders open and travel further normalizes to drive growth in air transport aftermarket sales. The policy change in China should provide added fuel to this dynamic. On the commercial OE side, build rate schedules among the OEMs are trending upwards year-over-year, leading to more shipset deliveries for Honeywell, driving revenue growth but also translating into a corresponding increase in selection credits, a headwind to margins. In Defense & Space, we plan to convert our strong order book into sales and expect Defense to return to growth in 2023 as the supply chain improves. Supply chain constraints, not demand, remain the gating factor to both commercial and Defense volume growth in 2023, but we're encouraged by the improvements our team has executed in recent months, resulting in 7% output growth in 2022. The sourcing environment for electronic components in Aero improved over the past quarter, but the supply chain for mechanical components remains constrained due to skilled labor shortages among Tier 3 and 4 suppliers. We entered 2023 with Aerospace backlog levels that are more than 20% higher year-over-year, giving us confidence in our growth projections. For overall Aero, we expect organic growth for the year to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. While Aerospace will likely be our strongest top line grower in 2023, we expect only modest margin expansion year-over-year as increased volume leverage is largely offset by unfavorable mix due to increased selection credits in the commercial OE business. In Building Technologies, we're cognizant of the broader economic environment and expect private investment in nonres construction to continue to be impacted by increased financing costs. However, throughout 2022, we built a strong slate of orders partially as a result of the supply chain environment that provides solid sales visibility and buffer for 2023. In addition, we believe that institutional investment will remain robust, buoyed by government stimulus funds that have not yet been deployed, supporting key verticals such as education, airports and health care. We see the most significant sales growth this year coming from building projects and building management systems as we capitalize on a robust 2022 book-to-bill in these businesses. We also expect increased spot orders for our building services throughout the year as the supply chain normalizes, layering incremental demand in. For overall HPT, we remain cautious in the current environment, expecting our strong backlog to support us early in the year and anticipate low single-digit organic sales growth for 2023 overall. However, we remain very confident in our long-term framework for Building Technologies as much of our portfolio is aligned with secular trends of sustainability and energy efficiency. On the segment margins, we expect to carry the momentum from 2022's strong exit rate, resulting in year-over-year expansion for the full year.  In PMT, we're set up to build upon an impressive 2022 and convert favorable macro conditions into another solid year with sales growth sequentially throughout the year. Backlog built through 2022 will enable another year of growth in Process Solutions led by lifecycle solutions and services and thermal solutions. In UOP, improved comps as we lap the lost Russian sales headwinds will provide support to a business that already has potential for upside. Our Process Technologies business returned to growth in the fourth quarter and is poised to continue to grow in '23, while catalyst shipments should remain robust throughout the year. Demand for new energy capacity to offset lost Russian supply will also be a tailwind, particularly for our LNG business. In advanced materials, growth will continue despite difficult comps, thanks to strong demand for our Solstice products and supply chain improvements. In addition to Solstice, our other sustainable offerings will benefit from legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and increased customer focus on environmental responsibility. Orders in our Sustainable Technology Solutions business have accelerated dramatically over the past 2 years, and we're expecting more of the same in '23 as we continue towards our $700 million sales target by the end of 2024. In total, we expect PMT sales to be up mid-single digits for '23. PMT margins should expand modestly as a result of improved volume leverage and continued pricing and productivity actions. Turning to Safety and Productivity Solutions. That will be the business most impacted by the macroeconomic environment in '23. An Intelligrated decreased investment in new warehouse capacity will continue to limit near-term opportunities in our long-cycle projects business with a trough in demand likely coming this year before returning to growth in '24. However, our aftermarket services business has been growing at double-digit rates, and we expect that to continue in 2023. In productivity solutions and services, short-cycle demand softness and the distributor destocking will impact sales in the first half of '23, but we expect this dynamic to taper off and should see sequential improvement later in the year. In sensing and safety technologies, sales growth will continue in '23 after a strong finish to 2022. In total, we expect SPS sales to be down mid- to high single digits for the year. From a margin standpoint, '23 should be another solid year for SPS as we continue to benefit from improved business mix and drive our operational improvements. While 4Q '22 was a high watermark for the business and will not necessarily be the new standard moving forward, we believe high-teen margin rates are achievable in 2023. So we expect our overall segment margin to expand 50 to 90 basis points next year, supported by higher sales volumes, our continued commercial excellence efforts and productivity actions. Similar to last year, we expect SPS margins to expand the most as we build on our operational improvements in '22 and continue to benefit from improved mix and cost structure in that business. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $8.80 to $9.20, flat to up 5% adjusted despite an approximately $0.55 headwind from lower pension income. Excluding this impact, our adjusted EPS range would have been $9.35 to $9.75, up 7% to 11% adjusted. On the free cash flow front, we expect a range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion in 2023 or $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, excluding the onetime $1.2 billion net impact of NARCO, HWI and UOP matters. I'll walk through the puts and takes for our '23 cash flow in greater detail in a couple of minutes. But first, let's turn to Slide 7 and walk through our EPS bridge for 2023. As you can see, segment profit will be the key driver of our earnings growth in '23, contributing $0.59 at the midpoint of our guidance range. Net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $475 million to $625 million, which includes capacity for $200 million to $325 million of repositioning, which is lower than the approximately $400 million we used in '22. For tax, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for the year. With these inputs below the line and other items, excluding pension, are expected to be up $0.05 per share year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance primarily driven by lower repositioning and asbestos charges, partially offset by higher net interest expense.  For share count, our base case for 2023 is that our minimum 1% share count reduction program will result in a benefit of approximately $0.15 per share, reducing our weighted average share count to approximately 672 million from the 683 million in 2022. As we previously communicated, we expect a large decline in pension and OPEB income this year as a result of the increased interest rate environment. For the full year, we expect approximately $550 million of pension and OPEB income, down about $500 million from 2022, driving about $0.55 headwind to EPS. However, this is a noncash accounting item as our overfunded pension status will ensure that no incremental contributions are needed. We ended '22 with a pension-funded status of over 125% as a result of diligent management and strong returns, a great position to be in for our employees and shareholders. In total, we expect '23 earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.20, flat to up 5% year-on-year on an adjusted basis. However, excluding the impact of noncash pension headwinds, our guidance would be a range of $9.35 to $9.75, up 9% at the midpoint. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about the drivers of our free cash guidance for 2023. As we've outlined in the bridge, our '23 free cash flow story can be characterized as strong operational performance offset by a few discrete nonoperational items. Income growth is the largest driver of free cash flow, and we expect to make further progress this year on working capital as the supply chain normalizes. We expect '23 free cash flow, excluding the settlement of the legacy legal matters we discussed earlier, to range between $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, up 8% year-over-year at the midpoint as we had previously spoken about. Accounting for the settlements, we're expecting free cash flow for 2023 in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion. Now let's turn to Slide 9, and we can discuss our guidance for Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we entered '23 with record backlog, providing a solid foundation for the first quarter. Supply chains remain constrained, however, we anticipate modest sequential improvement in volumes. We're closely monitoring the impacts of Zero COVID policy changes in China as the country reopens and eased its COVID restrictions and are wary of potential Q1 impacts. However, we anticipate that these policy changes will be a net positive for demand as we progress throughout the year and will result in a robust second half in China. Looking at the segments. We expect sales growth in Aerospace in the first quarter as the demand environment remains robust and we execute on our strong backlog. However, the rate of growth will be more subdued than our full year expectations as we anticipate 1Q will be the most supply-constrained for the quarter. In Building Technologies, we anticipate modest organic sales growth in the first quarter as we work through our backlog, and the supply chain continues to heal. We see the strongest sales growth in building projects, followed by increased sales of Fire. In PMT, we expect another quarter of year-over-year growth in 1Q. We expect that growth to be once again led by advanced materials with Process Solutions the laggard, though still with strong year-over-year growth. We're expecting -- sorry, we experienced a disruption in one of our PMT plants that will cause some unplanned downtime, though that is embedded in our guide. In Safety and Productivity Solutions, short-cycle and warehouse automation demand softness will offset growth in Intelligrated aftermarket services and the sensing part of our sensing and safety technologies business, leading to a decline in year-over-year sales. However, we expect another strong margin performance in the high teens. So for overall Honeywell, we anticipate sales in the range of $8.3 billion to $8.6 billion in the first quarter, up 1% to 5% organically. We expect margins in the range of 21.4% to 21.8%, up 30 to 70 basis points year-over-year as we remain diligent in our price/cost management and benefit from favorable business mix. The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between $165 million to $210 million of an expense with a range of repositioning between $80 million and $120 million as we continue to provide capacity to fund our transformational efforts. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22% for the quarter and average share count to be approximately 675 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter EPS between $1.86 and $1.96, down 3% to up 3% year-over-year or up 5% to 10%, excluding the year-over-year impact of lower noncash pension income. And lastly, while the first quarter is already historically our lowest from a free cash flow perspective, the settlement payments related to the aforementioned legal liabilities were paid out in January, and we expect cash from operations to be a net use in 1Q. Overall, while we maintain a prudent level of caution, we're confident in our operational abilities and our portfolio of differentiated technologies. Our portfolio is well positioned for this stage of the cycle, and we'll continue to innovate and invest in the businesses to support long-term growth. Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Darius on Slide 10. 2022 was another year of both challenges and progress for Honeywell. Despite another host of macroeconomic and geopolitical difficulties, we attacked the challenges we faced head on. We overdelivered on our financial commitments. While 2023 brings new [indiscernible], including potential recession scenarios, leading to uncertain demand in short cycle with a record $30 billion backlog, a robust balance sheet and one that has been further derisked due to the NARCO settlement and the ability to deploy capital organically and inorganically, I remain optimistic about the future of Honeywell and believe the company is well positioned to drive innovation to solve some of the world's most challenging problems. One last item before we move to Q&A. I'm pleased to announce that our 2023 Investor Day will be held on May 11 in New York City. At this Investor Day, I, along with our other members of the senior management team, will provide an update on Honeywell's business strategy, exciting new growth opportunities and our long-term growth algorithm. We look forward to sharing more about Honeywell's future at that time. With that, Sean, let's move to Q&A. Thank you, Darius. Darius, Greg, Vimal and Anne are now available to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Crystal, please open the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Just wanted to start -- my question would be around the first quarter outlook. So maybe 2 parts on that. Firstly, just on the segment margin assumption. Are we assuming within that, that you have a sort of 200 or 300 points increase at SPS year-on-year and then maybe are down in Aerospace and PMT on margins? Just wanted to check that. And then also in Q1, should we expect orders to be down after they were up kind of low single digit in the second half of last year? Thanks, Julian. First off, we don't guide orders, so we're not really going to comment on that specifically. As it relates to the margin outlook you highlighted, I think you're in the right neighborhood. Again, we don't guide our individual margin rates for each of the segments. But to expect that Aero might be down in 1Q is probably a reasonable expectation. And as I highlighted, SPS is going to be on the top end of our margin expansion all year long, frankly, given all the work that, that team has done, adjusting their cost structure for the realities of the sales environment that they've been in as well as, as we talked about before, the reductions in Intelligrated sales are actually not painful from a margin standpoint. They actually help given the margin profile of that business. So I think your instincts are right, but we're not going to be specific on that guide. Yes. And maybe just to add to that, I mean, I think SPS's results, particularly in Q4, really exemplify our -- the strength of our operating systems and how quickly we adjust to market conditions. As you saw, they posted record margins. And that's not by accident. That's by very pronounced actions. They knew they were facing some challenges on the revenue side. They adjusted their cost structure. They maximized our aftermarket services business, which result in a really nice margin profile. That's an example of how Honeywell operates, which is when we see challenges, we act upon them early and make sure that we still print very good results despite some market headwinds. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Can you just give a little more color on how much the OEM incentives are, what kind of headwind that is? And then are you guys on track for the longer-term target? What's -- any color on the trajectory and timing towards that? I think you said historically or last year, it was, I don't know, 29%. Are you guys still on track for that? Yes. I mean, we absolutely are. I think that we're very committed to that number. As we look at the outlook for this year, we're very much within our operating algorithm that we provided last Investor Day, sort of -- if you just take the midpoint, we're sort of at the lower end on revenue, but we're above our margin profile. But in terms of our commitments to our long-term gains, it's very much on track. The OEM credits are significant as a headwind. And Greg? Yes. So -- and think about that -- that is tied to Boeing's delivery specifically of airplanes and incentives that we have for -- with the airlines who are taking those airplanes. And that is going to be a multiyear realignment. Today, they've promised in excess of their production rate in terms of deliveries. And so that's going to -- that's what's going to move the needle. It's going to impact our sales. When we print our OE sales growth rates, you're going to see that as an offset, and it's obviously a margin headwind. So it's measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We're not going to be precise about what that is. And again, there's going to be variability around that, depending on the actual delivery performance of the OEs to the airlines themselves. Yes. And maybe just some closing 2 points. We do expect modest margin expansion in Aero. And we're very committed to the goal we gave you at the last Investor Day. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. I was wondering if you guys could walk through a little bit of what your cost inflation assumptions are and maybe a little color around kind of that -- the price/cost environment. Just in context, are we kind of done with the inflation part of the cycle? Are your suppliers still raising prices on you guys? And are you still raising prices on your side? And just a little bit of color per segment, I think, would be helpful. And I'll pass it on after that. Scott, as a headline, I would say that inflation is moderating. It's not going away. So we are not losing our eye on our model on driving positive price/cost. And -- but on a trend basis, there's some deflation in some commodities. But labor costs still high, energy costs are kind of more on a standstill basis. So that's our entry assumption that it's on a -- more on a reducing trend but not getting -- moving away. So our pricing targets have been adjusted. We still want positive price/cost model into our P&L. So we're not going to go away from that execution we did in 2022. But we're also sensitive that with the market being tighter compared to 2022, we want to also protect our volumes. And to that extent, we're watching how we want to adjust our price/cost algorithm. So that's kind of the overarching principles. They vary within the businesses little bit, but on -- directionally, that's our guiding principles. Maybe, Greg, if you want to add anything. Yes. I mean, all I would say is that means rather than double-digit price increases, we're planning on mid-single digits, maybe low single digits this year with inflation in that same neighborhood. Yes. And I think that's important is that we do -- we just don't do pricing blindly. I mean, we do mark -- watch demand versus pricing versus balancing our inflation. And we try to do that thoughtfully such that it's not just blind increases. We also have to be mindful of market share, demand, et cetera.  And we've got a set of analytics to do that. I mean, this is the power of Honeywell Digital, which we've been implementing in the last 3 to 4 years. Our level of visibility accuracy is actually really good, and it's a new set of muscles we've developed actually in the last 1.5 years as we face this inflationary environment. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Maybe if I could ask about supply chain improvement. You have a little bit of improvement in working capital year-over-year on supply chain. Can you frame the total impact in 2022 of supply chain? And how do you expect it panning out in '23? You called it out in Aerospace with the Tier 3, Tier 4 suppliers having labor issues. Where else are you seeing it? And how do you kind of expect it to improve across the segments? Yes. Let me kind of -- there's sort of not one way to describe it, but I'll give you a few metrics which indicate sort of the direction. I mean, I think the punchline -- the summary punchline, it is improving, and we saw that. I mean, we saw a reduction in our past due in 3 out of the 4 SBGs. The only one the past dues went up in Q4 was Aero. But we also saw very robust demand in Aero. So I think you have to offset that. Is that an issue instead of opportunity? And I would tell you that our Aero output on a year-over-year basis was up around 15%. So that's actually a pretty good outcome, which also tells you that we're migrating in the right direction and given that the past due is reduced in the other one. So let me kind of split the discussion on 2 segments. One, for semiconductors, it is definitely getting better. It is improving, and we see that sort of really moderating towards a normal state before the end of this year. That's sort of what we saw. We saw some clearing of the past dues. We still have some left, and that's how we see it. In Aero, it's also improving. The pace is likely going to be slower than what it was in semiconductors. Our level of decommits in Q4 was below 20%, which was a low for the year. Every quarter prior to Q4, the level of decommits from our supply base was over 20% -- actually, under 20%, which is also a good sign. So we see a slow and steady improvement as we move throughout the year. That's sort of our expectation for the supply chain. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Just wanted to dive into SPS a bit more. So if we think about -- maybe first of all, can we just dive in a bit deeper into what happened with the PPS. I know there's been some channel headwinds there, but that's a big change from what we saw last quarter.  And then when we think about the 2023 outlook, it looks like Intelligrated down 15%, 20%. Is that representative of the market? Or are you being more selective in terms of the projects that you've been accepting and therefore converting? And then on top of that, I know that's only one question, but it looks like margins this year is high teens, maybe 20% range. When we normalize for mix beyond this year, are we going to be above 20%? Any color there would be helpful. Can you repeat the last one because I didn't quite get the last question there, Nigel? Yes. So the last part of the one question is when we normalize for mix to Intelligrated PPS in '24/'25, are we at 20-and-above margins? Yes. I think that one was going to be -- it's probably too early to tell, but what I will tell you is that for -- we already basically demonstrated we can get to 20% margins in SPS in Q4. So the target hasn't changed in terms of what's happening overall with the business. Yes, Intelligrated is -- the markets are down. I mean, we see it, the warehouse and distribution segment is down. There's an overbuild that occurred in the year 2020 and 2021. The markets are absorbing that capacity. We do expect an uptick in orders and return to growth in 2024. We actually are encouraged by the pipeline that's starting to form. And at the same time, we're also being a little bit more selective in terms of margin profile and so on. And we have an algorithm in terms of the kinds of orders that we want. So it's a little bit of both. PSS has been a bit softer than in the prior. We got to remember that we're coming off of record orders, particularly in the first half. But overall, we expect to see a fairly strong robust level of business in the second half of this year, and we still have a backlog to draw from. So I don't think there's -- there was nothing in FPS in Q4 that was out of expectations. It was actually incredibly consistent. And frankly, I was very encouraged by the margin rate, and that team has done a nice job in really managing to the cards they're dealt from a revenue base, using our Accelerator operating system to really deliver a strong financial result even with some revenue headwinds. I don't know, Vimal, if you... So IGS, I just want to add a comment on IGS. I think top line challenge will be there in '23. But we are focused on margin in this business. Our aftermarket service business is growing double digits for last several years. That trend will continue in 2023. In fact, we want to do everything possible to continue to drive that at a higher rate and other margin improvement opportunity but better operating efficiency, executing projects better and faster is going to be another focus area. So while the volumes are down, we are constantly looking at margin expansion strategy in Intelligrated business. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Just a couple of questions on PMT. So first, on decarbonization, I mean, clearly a big revenue driver. But are you seeing any delays in process and fund disbursement at the federal level because we sort of heard about just shortage of staffing there? So that's question one.  And second, if you could just talk about visibility on advanced material strength because that seems to be just get better and better every quarter. So on the -- Andrew, on the decarbonization, I would say, at least I see much stronger trend in orders in our Sustainable Technology Solutions business as we had forecasted, IRS at least helping. We had a pretty strong performance in our sustainable aviation fuel part of the portfolio. We see that further strengthening in 2023. But in addition, now we see activity happening in carbon capture and hydrogen space. So we see more active projects where customers are making decisions. So we remain very optimistic on good performance by STS business in 2023. On advanced materials, I would say the momentum on Solstice continue. We see more application adoption in newer areas. As an example, heat pump is becoming another exciting area where we are developing new application. And that business is all about expanding new application and expanding new geographies. So we see that trend. There are pockets in advanced material where there is an economic headwind on residential side. So that's a smaller part of the business, but there are headwinds. There are pockets in electronic materials, where there's a server-related demand in PC. So we supply some products in that. But on an overall picture, advanced materials has a strong momentum. And you said it rightly, the momentum will continue in 2023 also. Yes. Maybe just to add a couple of things and a couple of specific numbers. I mean, our orders in Q4, particularly in our Fluorines business, were very, very strong, I think, double-digit strong. Our LST business is strong. UOP is well positioned for the year. Sparta business was extraordinarily strong on the acquisition we made in 2021. So all in all, I think it was a very strong orders quarter. As we pointed out on our track, if you remember, some of the very, very unusual cold weather that we faced around the Christmas time caused us some challenges in some of our process operations because, frankly, they're just not built to operate in 5-degree weather. That's not what you typically see in Louisiana in December. So all in all, I think that this is -- our AM and PMT business is well positioned. Good orders growth and strong performance should be expected. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Just a follow-up on Aero margins from me, if I could. Appreciate the color on the OEM incentives. Just trying to think about the next couple years also, if you can give us some directional help, right? It's not hard to imagine those incentives continue to escalate the next couple years as Boeing delivers more, but I think you might be getting some help going the other way in business jet or other parts of Aero. So can you just give us a sense of, is 2023 kind of peak headwind for incentives, how it might play out in '24 and '25? Yes. Great question, Jeff, and your -- again, your instincts are on. This is a bubble, right, because they -- Boeing, in particular, was not able to deliver jets when they were grounded. And so that acceleration is going to go up and then come back down again. As we see it right now, it looks like '23 is going to be the top, and then it starts coming back down. But again, that's going to depend entirely on the pace of those deliveries. But it ought to be, let's say, reoriented back with deliveries in our view by 2025, for sure, and maybe into 2024. So this is going to be a temporary headwind, and then things will realign back where deliveries and shipments come back into line. And so therefore, our P&L will become more aligned. Yes. I think that's exactly right. I think that this is probably an unusual '23 headwind. But even with that headwind, we expect to modestly expand margins. But I think the most important thing that's missing here is we're very excited about the future of Aerospace. I mean, the orders are up. Backlog is way up. I mean, we think the next 3 years will be very exciting for Aero. Supply chain is... Supply chain is getting better. Our ISC teams have really demonstrated unlock of a lot of the capacity. And I think there's nothing other than to be excited for the next 3 years in Aerospace. It's -- I'm very confident in the backlog position, and it's going to be a really nice period for that business. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. So you mentioned capital deployment in line with 3-year $25 billion plan for '23, I think, which would mean another year somewhat similar to '22. You deployed almost $8 billion of cash. Obviously, out there, you've got National Instruments conducting a strategic review, as I'm sure you know. If Honeywell were to consider to be quite a bit larger than you've done in the past there, so we know you have the financial capacity to do it, but you've been disciplined when you've done M&A and really stuck to more bolt-ons. Can you remind us of your return hurdles to do a larger acquisition and what, if any, strategic requirements you have to make a larger acquisition? Yes. I think good question. Yes. So I mean, obviously, we have a balance sheet that's strong. And over the last 2 years, we have, let's call it, roughly around $15 billion-plus to deploy it based on our 25 over the next 2 years, so we have the capacity. But I'd just point out a couple things. Number one is we are disciplined in our approach. That's point one. So point two is we're a controls and automation and sustainability and digital company. And point three is we typically don't do hospital acquisitions. So we are interested in doing more M&A -- smart M&A in '23. I think you should expect that at some point. But it's going to be thoughtful. It's going to be acquired at a price where we have a lot of confidence in generating shareholder value. And it's going to be something that we can -- is truly strategic and fit what we do as a company. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. I understand you guys have above-average backlog right now, obviously, some longer-cycle businesses as well as supply chain. Any way we should think about backlog conversion this year? Or where do you guys think maybe backlog should end or hopefully end if you're able to start getting more product out the door? I think teasing out the demand environment versus the supply chain environment has been a bit of a trick here for a while. Yes. Maybe I'll start and I'll turn it over to Vimal. So first of all, we feel very good about the backlog because, if you sort of look at the backlog where we are in totality, it's about $3 billion to $4 billion more than what I call a normal state. If you go back 2, 3 years, if -- we can debate whether it's in that $3 billion to $5 billion more than normal. So the backlog position is very strong. From a long-cycle perspective, Aero, especially PMT, very strong position. Even in the short-cycle businesses, which are predominantly HBT and SPS, we've got strong backlog through at least the first half of this year. We do expect an uptick as we go into the second half of this year in terms of some of those businesses because we have some unusual pull-forward order activity in the first half. So especially as we get into the second half of this year, we don't know this yet, but we're cautiously optimistic it can actually be one of those unique periods where the short cycle and long cycle are turning at a really good pace. We have much more confidence in the first half based on the strength of the long cycle, and we expect an uptick in the second half in the short cycles [indiscernible]. So maybe to impress on that in addition, as we talked earlier, we do expect supply chain performance to get better both on the Aero supply chain and semiconductor constraint, which will mean that we can burn our past dues/backlog better than our -- what we did in '22. And we also expect that our project businesses will also execute on our backlog on a more determined basis because they also faced a lot of headwinds on supply chain constraints in 2022. Where the backlog will land, it's just indirectly answering the question of orders forecast, and we don't guide that. But we remain optimistic. We're going to get our fair share of demand in the market that we can commit. And as long as market performs, we will perform the -- in line with the market. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. I want to ask that last question maybe slightly differently because guidance is a little bit wider than normal. And so perhaps maybe under what scenario would you guys see yourselves coming in below the midpoint of the guidance -- the EPS guidance for the year? Yes. I mean, I think -- first of all, let me -- there's a couple of questions. And the first one is, why is the guidance wider than normal? Because I think we would probably admit that in terms of the economic scenarios this year are probably a bit wider than most people guess. And you have anything ranging from a soft landing out there to a deep recession, and I've heard opinions anywhere in that range. So I just think from a Honeywell perspective -- and this is, I think, consistent of how we guide every year is -- and probably this year more than ever, we try to have a little bit of a wider range, which is indicative of the uncertainty around the economic conditions. And I would say if I were compare this year versus '22 or '21, it's probably more uncertainty rather than less. So that's sort of the reason for the wide range. In terms of the range, it's out, sure. At the lower end, it's probably -- it probably means that it's tougher economic conditions. The second half is the economic conditions turn worse. The short cycle is worse than we expect at the top end. It's a bit more of what we hope is the expectation, which is some of the order activity turns. Short cycle becomes more robust in the second half, and China returns to growth. I mean, we -- Q1 -- we actually think Q1 in China could be challenging because of the lifting of the COVID restrictions, Chinese New Year and so on. And we embedded that in our guide. But we actually think that second half in China could actually be quite strong. And if that comes to fruition, that sort of points to the upper end of our guide. So that's why we kind of have a bit of a wider range. And by the way, we did guide a wider range like this historically, of course, so it's not that much wider, and '22 was a little bit narrower. But I think it's just -- it's as simple as it's indicative of the economic uncertainty that I think many of us are facing. And there's a wide range of educated guess as to... Yes. I think we'll know a lot more come June, right? I mean, as we talked about, I think we feel pretty good about where we are from a backlog position. And no one really knows what the level of activity in the economy will be. I mean, we've had some good things. The European winter has been more mild than people thought, and Europe's held up relatively well in versus what some may have figured it could be. But I think, as you said, we feel really good about where we are right now. And we'll continue to take that temperature as we go through the first 4 to 5 months of the year. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Start with congrats on getting to the finish line on the NARCO Trust. That was a really long road. And I know you had to get all the approvals. So nice to see. Thank you, Deane. Yes. I know, Anne, it's been a long road. But Honeywell was one of the first to pursue that trust, and you've got all the approvals with the plaintiffs and so forth. But great to see it derisked. And just a follow-up on the last question on the geography. Did anything really surprise you in the quarter in terms of the geographies? It seems like Europe -- was it just the weather that's not as dire on the energy side? But what were the surprises on the geographies? And what's baked in for '23 major geographies? I know you have a little bit on China, but if you could round that out, that'd be helpful. Maybe I'll start, and Vimal will add any further commentary. I would say no major surprises, I mean, in terms of how we ended up. I mean, Europe was softer, particularly the U.K. was really soft in Q4. That probably stood out for us in Europe. But then as we looked at December, the exit rates weren't actually bad. So November and October were a bit weaker. December exit rates were better. In terms of the overall business performance, I mean, it was actually incredibly consistent with what we guided. I mean, we guided -- we came in roughly at the middle of our range, a little bit better on operating margin. I mean, we guide for a reason, and that's sort of where we ended. And by the way, thank you for acknowledging the NARCO. I mean, I think as you kind of read the articles and some of the other companies out there, I can't understate how important -- or overstate how important it is to eliminate liabilities from your balance sheet. And when you can do that permanently with confidence, it substantially derisks the future of the company. I think maybe this didn't get as much offense as I think it should have because it was a huge deal. It hit up a lot of bandwidth. But I am thrilled to have this liability reduced off the balance sheet. Vimal, if you... So I think the only thing I'll add is that I think everybody is aware of commentary on U.S. and Europe, so I won't repeat it. But high-growth regions represent a very large part of Honeywell revenue. We do expect China to have a strong growth in 2023. We are cautious in Q1 but very optimistic for the year. But other high-growth region markets, we are confident on good growth. Middle East, we have good backlog and a very strong pipeline for orders. India, we remain very optimistic. Turkey, Central Asia, we remain very optimistic, ASEAN. So overall, that part of the world should offset some of the headwinds we see in Europe, and that's what we are kind of dialing in into our planning process. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Darius Adamczyk for any closing remarks. I want to thank our shareholders for your ongoing support. We delivered strong fourth quarter results and continue to navigate effectively through multiple uncertainties with the typical level of operational rigor you've come to expect from Honeywell. Our future is bright, and we look forward to discussing this further at our upcoming Investor Day in May. Thank you all for listening, and please stay safe and healthy. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

         "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lilly Q4 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]   And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you, Lois. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo@Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke from the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.   And now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Okay. Thanks, Joe. 2022 is a year of strong pipeline and commercial performance for Lilly. We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022 despite the impact of the Alimta LOE in the U.S. and significant FX headwinds, and delivered another remarkable year of pipeline progress. We began 2023 with multiple updates to our late-stage pipeline.   In our Q2 2022 earnings call last August, we announced the filing of submissions for 2 assets with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway: pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma; and donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  Last month, we received response from the FDA on both these assets.   On January 19, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for accelerated approval of donanemab due to the limited number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. There were no other deficiencies cited. We will continue to work with the FDA to evaluate the best pathway to make this potential treatment option available to patients, and look forward to results next quarter for the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III confirmatory trial, which will form the basis of donanemab's application for traditional approval.   We have consistently stated that we would expect very limited uptake before CMS supports coverage. At the time we submitted for accelerated approval, we had hoped that there would be more movement from CMS to provide access to these medicines for people with Alzheimer's disease.   Unfortunately, this has not yet materialized. We maintain conviction that given the impact of this devastating disease and significant unmet need, positive confirmatory data and FDA traditional approval should be sufficient to support global reimbursement and patient access necessary for broad use of donanemab over time.   Also in the month of January, we received FDA approval for Jaypirca, the first and only non-covalent BTK inhibitor for adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. Jaypirca is a highly selective kinase inhibitor, whose novel, reversible binding mechanism and pharmacology may allow for extended targeting of the BTK pathway following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor.   We are pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca, and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for donanemab. We also look forward to the potential launch of 2 of our immunology assets later this year with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab and of tirzepatide for obesity. This current wave of new launches, along with the ongoing focus and progress in our next wave of R&D innovation, underpins our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth and expand our margins over time.   On Slide 4, you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue on a constant currency basis grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Volume in our core business, again, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, grew 13% in Q4 and 12% for the year. This volume-driven performance was attributed to our key growth products, which grew 21% last quarter.   For pipeline milestones, in addition to the recent FDA approval of Jaypirca, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call. Positive Phase III readout and FDA and EMA acceptance of the regulatory submission for Jardiance for adults with chronic kidney disease, the initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for tirzepatide in obesity, and FDA granting a Fast Track designation for tirzepatide in obstructive sleep apnea.   We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value. In late January, we announced plans to invest an additional $450 million for expansion of our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in North Carolina to further augment our manufacturing capacity for the years ahead.  On the business development front, we closed the acquisition of Akouos to expand our gene therapy capability, and we entered into a strategic research collaborations, with a focus on new modalities and technologies.   Finally, we continue to return capital to investors. In Q4, we distributed nearly $900 million to shareholders via the dividend, and we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fifth consecutive year.   Moving to Slide 5. You'll see a list of the key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and ESG updates we are discussing today or that were discussed during our guidance call on December 13.   One item I'd like to highlight is the collaboration we announced in December with EVA Pharma to deliver a sustainable supply of affordable, high-quality insulin to at least 1 million people living with diabetes in low- to middle-income countries, most of which are in Africa.  This is an important collaboration with a local company to produce low quality -- or low-cost, high-quality medicines, sorry. Strengthening capacity and building self-reliance for insulin manufacturing within the African region will provide a more sustainable supply in the long term.   With this agreement, Lilly will sell insulin API to EVA Pharma at a significantly reduced price and provide pro bono technology transfer to enable EVA to formulate, fill and finish insulin vials and cartridges.  We're proud to be a part of this novel arrangement, which aligns with our 30x30 goal of improving access to quality health care for 30 million people living in limited resource settings annually by 2030.   Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2022 results. Thanks, Dave. Slides 6 and 7 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.  As Dave mentioned, we're pleased to report 10% growth for our core business in Q4 on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume growth. A couple of notable items affected year-over-year comparisons. The first is COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q4 2022, which compared to the prior year, declined 96% from approximately $1.1 billion in Q4 2021 to $38 million in Q4 2022.  Bebtelovimab is currently not authorized for emergency use in any U.S. region, and we continue to expect no COVID-19 antibody revenue for 2023.  Second is the continued foreign exchange headwinds compared to 2021, which resulted in a 415 basis points dampening of revenue growth in Q4.   Key growth products grew by 21% and accounted for 70% of our revenue this quarter. For the full year 2022, revenue excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, grew 2% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 80.5% in Q4, an increase of approximately 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized price and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs.   Total operating expenses declined 1% in Q4. Lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were largely offset by higher marketing, selling and administrative expenses and higher R&D expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 3% in Q4, primarily driven by costs supporting the launch of new products and indications, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  R&D expense for the quarter increased 5%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.   Operating income declined 7% compared to Q4 2021 driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin for Q4 was 27.4%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 330 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Full year operating margin was 27.8%, an increase from 26.8% in 2021.   Our Q4 effective tax rate was 7.3%, bringing our full year 2022 effective tax rate to 10.3%. As we shared during our guidance call in December, we had assumed that the 2017 Tax Act provision requiring capitalization, amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes would be deferred or repealed by Congress in late 2022. However, no legislative action was taken related to this provision, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for 2022 versus the guidance range previously shared.  In addition, this provision did increase our tax payment in 2022 by approximately $1.2 billion.  At the bottom line, earnings per share declined 4% in Q4 and increased 7% for the full year.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 10%.  Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. The swap volume-driven growth was led by Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance.  Net price was flat in the U.S. this quarter. For the full year, the net price decrease of 3% in the U.S. was in line with our expectation.   Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 increased 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Jardiance, Trulicity and Verzenio. We remain encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe.   In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 6% in constant currency. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted, albeit less so than in prior quarters by decreased demand for several products that have lost patent exclusivity, including Alimta and Cymbalta. We expect to return to growth this year as we scale key products and launch Mounjaro.   In China, revenue grew 2% in constant currency as continued volume growth was mostly offset by lower realized prices for Humalog as a result of the volume-based procurement process and for products listed on the NRDL as well as by COVID-19 disruption.   Revenue in the rest of the world increased 11% in constant currency this quarter, driven by approximately $130 million of onetime revenue associated with the sale of the company's right to Alimta in Korea and Taiwan.   As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth, contributing 15 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. As mentioned previously, the decline in COVID-19 antibody volume was substantial in Q4 2022 and was largely offset -- and largely offset volume growth from key products.  While we will face similar prior period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue through the first 3 quarters of 2023,  our long-term growth prospects are underpinned by our innovative pipeline and key growth products, including Mounjaro.   Slide 10 further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 21% or 27% in constant currency, generated $5.1 billion in sales and made up 70% of our total revenue.   While Lilly's incretin portfolio understandably generates high interest, we continue to see tremendous growth, both in percentage and absolute terms for other key products, including Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio sales in the quarter grew 100%, driven mainly by the edge of an indication. Jardiance sales grew 42%, and the product retains the leadership position in a competitive market globally.  Demand for our incretin portfolio remains strong, both for Trulicity globally and Mounjaro in the U.S., and we remain focused on bringing additional capacity online to meet this robust demand in upcoming launches.   In terms of supply, as mentioned in our guidance call in December, given strong demand for incretin products, there have been intermittent delays at wholesalers and pharmacies in receiving certain doses levels of Mounjaro and Trulicity in the U.S. We continue to update the FDA on the situation, and the FDA has been posting to its website details regarding affected doses and expected timing.  To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have announced plans to add additional substantial capacity in the years ahead. The most proximal of these efforts is our RTP side, North Carolina, where progress continues as planned, and we look forward to the start of production later this year.   Moving to Slide 11. Mounjaro's strong launch uptake continues, underpinned by differentiated efficacy profile and positive customer experiences.  For Q4, approximately 75% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients new to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class, and further 10% of switches from Trulicity.   As we mentioned in our Q3 earnings call in early November, we took actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of the Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients. We indicated at that time that these actions could negatively impact new prescription volumes but were not expected to impact net revenue.  As anticipated, we believe the new prescription volumes beginning in late November were impacted by these actions, with some week-by-week volatility driven by end-of-year seasonality.  We continue to build payer access for Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of January 1, access stands just over 50% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D.   Regarding the percentage of paid scripts, for Q4, we estimate the percentage of paid script from Mounjaro to be approximately 40%, with paid script defined as dose prescription outside the 25 non-covered co-pay cards, but inclusive of the 25 covered co-pay cards. As we expand payer access, the proportion of paid scripts should continue to increase.   On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2022, we invested $9.6 billion to drive future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investment.  In addition, we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock.   Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and are oriented towards achieving our strategic deliverables of top-tier revenue growth and speeding life-changing medicines to patients. We do this through investments in our current portfolio to drive new launches, investment in our manufacturing capacity, in our future innovation through R&D and business development. And we returned capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.   Slide 13 provides an updated 2023 financial guidance. The only change we've made from the guidance we provided in December is to update our effective tax rate, which result in an updated EPS range.  During December guidance call, we shared that the effective tax rate for 2023 would be approximately 16% based on the assumed deferral or repeal of the tax provision requiring capitalization of R&D. Since this provision was not deferred or repealed in 2022, and given the uncertainty around if and when such action will take place in 2023, we have updated our tax rate from 16% to approximately 13%.  This update to our effective tax rate results in new EPS range of $7.90 to $8.10 on a GAAP basis and $8.35 to $8.55 on a non-GAAP basis.   Regarding FX rates, there has been a general weakening of the dollar since we set our initial 2023 financial guidance last year. However, we're not adjusting guidance for FX changes at this time as we're only 1 month into the year, and FX markets can be quite volatile.   As I shared in December, the most significant headwind in revenue growth in 2023 versus 2022 will be the impact of COVID-19 antibody sales. This year-over-year comparisons will be most pronounced in Q1 2023, given that we had $1.5 billion of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q1 2022.  To a lesser extent, the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in the U.S. in Q2 2022 will also impact year-over-year growth in the first half of 2023. Still the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance range represents roughly 7% of growth or 50% growth for our core business, excluding COVID-19 antibodies.   This year holds tremendous promise for us to help patients as we execute on the current wave of potential launches while maintaining our commitment to invest in and progress future innovation. We expect this ongoing focus on disciplined execution and investment will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030.   Now I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline. Thanks, Anat. 2022 was a really productive year for Lilly R&Ds. We advanced our late-stage assets of tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab to key regulatory submissions, and we obtained the approval for Mounjaro. We launched Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in mid-2022.  As Dave shared, we received an approval last week for pirtobrutinib, now known as Jaypirca.  By the end of this year, we also have the potential to launch 2 new immunology assets with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. And for donanemab, we're looking forward to our Phase III readout mid-year, which if positive, will form the basis of our submission for traditional approval.   In 2022, we also gained clarity on the next wave of assets that have entered or will soon enter Phase III registrational trials. Those are our SERD in breast cancer; our weekly insulin for diabetes; remternetug in Alzheimer's disease; and as shared in our December guidance call, we now have orforglipron and retatrutide in diabetes and obesity.   Given the updates we provided in mid-December, today, I'll just briefly highlight progress since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 30, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2022 key events and potential key events for 2023.   Starting with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease. In November, we shared results from the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III trial in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. As the largest and broadest SGLT2 inhibitor trial in CKD to date, the results showed a significant benefit of Jardiance in reducing the relative risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% compared with placebo in people with chronic kidney disease.   The overall safety data were consistent with previous findings, confirming the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. CKD is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 850 million people globally and 37 million in the U.S. We've submitted to the FDA an EMA for approval, and expect to make submissions to other regulatory agencies in the coming months.   In January, we started QWINT-1, a Phase III study comparing fixed-dose escalation of Lilly's weekly insulin to insulin glargine in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes patients.  With this initiation, all 5 studies in the QWINT Phase III program are now underway.   Moving to earlier-stage assets in our diabetes and CV pipeline. In Q4, we advanced 2 assets into Phase II that aim to lower Lp(a), a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The first is an oral inhibitor, a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between the apo(a) protein and the lipoprotein particle; and the second uses siRNA to disrupt the production of apo(a) in the liver. We shared proof-of-concept data on the siRNA asset during our December 2021 R&D investor meeting. This is our second siRNA asset to advance to Phase II, following our ANGPTL3 siRNA, which entered Phase II earlier in 2022.  We also recently moved an siRNA asset targeting apoC-III in cardiovascular disease into Phase I.   Our genetic medicines portfolio is advancing, and we remain optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes with these molecules.  Lastly, we discontinued our Phase I KHK inhibitor.   In oncology, we're, of course, pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca, and we look forward to continuing the substantial ongoing development program for the molecule in the years ahead. Jaypirca is the second product approved from our 2019 Loxo Oncology acquisition, which reshaped our oncology efforts at Lilly. Loxo@Lilly's growing NME portfolio now includes a number of emerging assets shown in our pipeline, including our FGFR3 program, which recently dosed its first patient.   Also, in Q4, we dosed the first patient in EMBER-4, our second Phase III trial for imlunestrant, our oral SERD. EMBER-4 will study imlunestrant in the adjuvant setting as a sequential monotherapy in patients who previously received 2 to 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer with increased risk of recurrence.   Lastly, turning to Verzenio. As noted in our guidance call, at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, we shared the latest interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. We've now submitted an sNDA to the U.S. FDA to potentially expand our adjuvant indication beyond the currently indicated cohort 1 Ki-67 greater than 20% population.   In immunology, we're looking forward to potential FDA approvals later this year for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis, which we expect in the first half of the year and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, which we expect in the second half of the year.  Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, as mentioned in our guidance call, we presented exciting proof-of-concept results for our PD-1 agonist antibody, peresolimab, in rheumatoid arthritis at the ACR conference in November, and we have now initiated a global dose-ranging Phase IIb study.   Moving to neuroscience. We've advanced into Phase II our P2X7 inhibitor for chronic pain. Lilly acquired rights to this asset from Asahi Kasei Pharma in early 2021.   With regards to donanemab. As Dave mentioned, the solid efficiency cited by the FDA to our submission for accelerated approval was the number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. The Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial, on which the accelerated approval application was based, allowed patients to complete their course of treatment with donanemab when they reached a predefined level of amyloid plaque clearance.   Due to the speed of plaque reduction that we saw, many patients were able to stop dosing as early as 6 months into treatment, resulting in fewer patients receiving 12 months or more of donanemab dosing. We remain confident in the potential of donanemab as a new treatment for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, and look forward to sharing results from the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study in Q2 of this year.   In summary, while 2022 was an outstanding year of pipeline progress, we're fully focused on the work we need to do in 2023 to make our next set of potential medicines a reality for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates throughout the year.   Now I turn the call back to Dave. Thanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2022. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We launched Mounjaro for patients with type 2 diabetes, while advancing and expanding our development program for tirzepatide, including the start of the SURMOUNT-MMO outcome study and the initiation of a rolling submission for chronic weight management.  In 2022, we submitted regulatory applications for important pipeline products like mirikizumab, pirtobrutinib and lebrikizumab. And in 2023, we've already received approval for Jaypirca and are poised to advance donanemab in the regulatory process, assuming positive data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III study. In addition, we continue to invest in our pipeline, our capacity, our capabilities and our people.  Finally, we returned $5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases; and for the fifth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase for 2023.  With continued growth of Mounjaro and our key products, including Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz, we expect our core business revenue to grow by mid-teens in 2023. We are energized by the launch opportunities before us this year, and know strong launch execution is key to our long-term success. Taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030, and to deliver on Lilly's mission to make life better for people around the world.  So now I'll turn it over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Thanks, Dave. [Operator Instructions] We'll end the call at 11:15. Lois, please go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question is from Colin Bristow from UBS. Just first on Mounjaro. So it looks like the net price dropped again from 3Q to 4Q. Can you just walk us through what specifically drove this? And just update us on how you expect this to trend over the course of the year. And then just maybe looking sort of out to the future of your obesity portfolio. Beyond GGG, do you have any interest in mechanisms that target the sort of the mitochondrial uncoupling side of the equation, that would be helpful. Thanks, Colin. We'll go to Mike for the first question on gross to net and price for Mounjaro and then hand over to Dan for kind of broader obesity mechanistic commentary. Mike? Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that is to kind of take a look at what we saw as kind of our Mounjaro paid scripts in Q4 and then how we think that will progress over '23.  In the fourth quarter, we classified about 40% of Mounjaro scripts as paid, which we defined as patients that aren't supported by our $25 non-covered savings program.  In our savings program, as we discussed at launch, was designed to bridge people living with type 2 diabetes to access. As we discussed in the Q3 earnings call, we have adjusted a program to better ensure it's being used for people living only with type 2 diabetes. These adjustments included removing our $25 non-covered benefit from our savings card for new patients.  We didn't make any adjustments for existing patients whose savings cards are set to expire on June of this year, June 30.  As expected, these changes have reduced new patient start volume while increasing the percent of new patients with a history of diabetes treatments and the percent with formulary coverage.  I think the way I would look at our savings program right now for new patients is that we have graduated from the bridging program and now are kind of the type of savings program really focused on covered patients that you would do in kind of a normalized cycle of a product.  So thus, we expect that Mounjaro's percent of paid scripts and the net revenue per script to increase through 2023 as we continue to increase access and grow new starts.  We remain disciplined in our access discussions so we can maximize long-term value. From the start, our value -- our approach was to make sure that we capture value in the long term versus the short term, and we've remained very disciplined on that. We have just over 50% access for lives in Part D and commercial segments for people living with type 2 diabetes. We're very pleased where we're at on the access front and where the way our contracting has turned out at this point. So hopefully, that helps provide some color to our gross to net in Q4. Thanks. Thanks, Colin. For your question on future mechanisms for treating obesity, I can assure you, we're not done innovating on behalf of people with obesity. There's a lot we can still do. I think keep your eyes open for more to come from Lilly labs on incretin and related types of mechanisms, but also broadly interested in a variety of new non-incretin-based mechanisms.  You specifically asked about, one, mitochondrial uncoupling, but there are several others, I think, that also have promise for patients.  I just sort of put a note of caution, though, treating obesity, we need to have a very high bar for the types of medicines we develop, remembering that this is a chronic, often lifetime disease and a highly prevalent population. We need medicines that, first and foremost, are extremely safe and really highly well tolerated for patients. So that's what we're looking for in future mechanisms. The next question is from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Just one follow-up on the last set of questions. Is it still reasonable to think about a net Mounjaro price that could be above that of Trulicity as we look out to 2024 or whenever you achieve kind of comparable payer access? And then my question was on donanemab. I know there wasn't a huge revenue opportunity tied to the accelerated approval. But I think you had talked about using that gap between accelerated approval and full approval to really ramp physician education and infrastructure, et cetera. How do you kind of manage through that now, I guess, where we're going to have maybe a full approval that could be occurring closer into a CMS decision? So just maybe elaborate a bit about what that means for donanemab over time. Thanks, Chris. All right. We'll go to Mike for the question about Mounjaro price kind of over time and how it might compare to Trulicity. And then to Anne on your donanemab question about activity that would occur to ramp up HCP education. Mike? Yes, thanks for the question. I can't get into [ real specifics ] about our net price for obvious reasons, but maybe I'll address the question this way.  I mean if you look at -- when we have - when we reach -- we think we'll reach broad access for Mounjaro and reach ultimately similar access levels that we have for Trulicity. There's nothing differently about how we'll promote or how we'll support patients on Mounjaro versus Trulicity. So at the end of the day, it will come down to our net price negotiations with payers. We believe that Mounjaro has a better profile. We invest a lot of innovation in there, and we do believe that it should have a better net price than Trulicity. Thanks, Mike. Anne? Yes. Thanks, Chris, for the question on physician education and readiness. So as you said, the accelerated approval is not going to provide access for the vast majority of patients, so it doesn't impact us in that way. And obviously, accelerated approval would have made it maybe a little bit easier to do some of the things that we wanted to do, but there's still a great deal that we can do -- actually have been doing to make sure that the health care system is ready for these medicines. So we begin working on that. Things such as developing the diagnostic ecosystem are incredibly important, making sure that there's better integrated Alzheimer's disease pathways to make sure that physicians can properly identify, refer, infuse these patients. So that's the area of focus right now.  Certainly, diagnostics are a key area of focus for Lilly. We've continued to expand our PET network to make sure that we're ready for patient diagnosis. And then as well, we continue to be committed to P-tau blood tests and intend to launch that this year.  So many things going on that I think can make us very ready for traditional approval and making sure that people can access these medicines. The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. So Dan, I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about where you see the oral GLP-1 space developing and how your product is likely to be positioned. A little bit of this, I think, is also what you think the unmet need is outside of where the sort of very robust weight loss that we see from Mounjaro is. And then just an add-on to that, how do you see the oral market developing in terms of other potential agonists? Is that something that Lilly is pursuing and hoping to further develop combinations there as well? Thanks, Seamus. And we'll go to Dan on this question. Yes. Thanks, Seamus. I'll get started. Maybe Mike wants to add on, on some of the marketplace questions. But clearly, obesity is a huge problem in the U.S. and around the world. I think 100 million Americans potentially with obesity and reaching 1 billion people around the world pretty soon. That's probably not a market that even all of the interested companies could address solely with injectables. So just given the scope of the problem around the world, we're going to need orals.  Ultimately, it's our goal to have orals that can match the safety, tolerability and efficacy of injectables. I think our oral GLP-1 is our first attempt in this space and has really good prospects for meeting that initial goal. But then noting, of course, that the injectables are going to get better over time and the orals will catch up as well.  The second part of your question was how do the orals catch up. And I think you're sort of alluding to an obvious issue, which is right now, our oral GLP-1 and other orals in the space are single mechanism, single incretin agonists. I think we've seen with great drugs like Trulicity and competitive products, what single agonist against GLP-1 can achieve. It's not as good, I think, as what can be achieved with dual agonism for tirzepatide or hopefully even triple agonism with GGG. And so you can bet we're working on oral solutions that can bring additional incretin activity to patients in a pill. Nothing ready to disclose today, but we're working hard. Next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. I have two related ones on tirzepatide. Dan, I know you have SURMOUNT-4 coming up, which is the maintenance study, but how has your thinking evolved, if at all, on the potential duration of tirzepatide use, either based on longer exposure from clinical studies or in the real world? And do you think that could inform payer discussions? And then, Mike, on Mounjaro, a moving target, but how does the prescriber base as of today compare with Trulicity? I'm trying to get a sense for maybe the endocrinology versus primary care mix and utilization in obesity. Great. Thank you, Geoff. So we'll go to Dan for the question on SURMOUNT-4 and duration of tirzepatide, and then to Mike on the question of how the prescriber base from Mounjaro compares to Trulicity. Yes. Sure. As I was just saying, I mean, obesity is clearly a chronic, often lifetime disease. And for such diseases, patients often need to take therapy for chronically -- potentially the life of the disease here. A lot of times in medicine, that doesn't happen. Of course, people come off of therapies because either the therapy is working, and they think they don't need it anymore or there's a benefit they can't see. I'm not sure either of those are the case for a drug like tirzepatide. People clearly can observe the benefits that the drug is having on their health and perhaps unfortunately, but not different really than any other drug that we have for any other disease. When you stop taking the drug, it's likely that it can no longer work and patients may see that as well.  So I think those factors will combine to have a pretty long duration of therapy. We have to wait and see in the marketplace. Maybe Mike has some early signals from patients, but still pretty early on. And Mike? Yes. No hard data yet, Dan, on that. But qualitatively, what we hear is what -- patients who've used Mounjaro, what they like and what they realize once they start using it is that it really does reduce the appetite and they enjoy the benefits of reducing appetite. It helps them lose their -- lose weight and stop being as consumed as much during the day, about 80. And we do know that when -- what we heard from our investigators in our studies is that when people stop taking Mounjaro, that their appetite goes back to the level it was before. So that's something very noticeable, something that a patient values from taking the therapy. And then when they stop the therapy, they then see this reversed.  And so we do believe that people are going to stop and see if they can lose weight. If they can, great. But I do think that they're going to see a very powerful signal very quickly to reinforce going back on the product. So I do think that will help reinforce the chronic use of tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes, and eventually for obesity if we get approved.  The question on Trulicity. Mounjaro -- if you look at Mounjaro's use right now and compare it to how many customers are using that versus Trulicity at this time, it's a lot broader population than we saw with Trulicity just because the market is a lot bigger, a lot more people are writing the treatment.  If you compare Mounjaro to the number of Trulicity writers today, there are more people writing Trulicity just because it's been on the market longer. They've gone through the adoption curve and Trulicity has better access, access and especially in Medicaid that drives additional prescribers to use that.  So overall, I'd say that Mounjaro is within the universe of the doctors who write Trulicity at this point. The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. I have a question on donanemab. I'm wondering if Lilly would agree that there is highly likely going to be higher ARIA-E and ARIA-H rates with your drug versus lecanemab when TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 reports out. The prior data would certainly suggest that.  If so, relative to lecanemab, doesn't that create a potential risk/benefit conundrum for FDA, assuming efficacy comes in around the same levels. I guess the bottom line here, is there a regulatory concern to contemplate maybe this is why the FDA issued the CRL? They want to see the full results from your second study. You don't just want to capture a few more patients to bring that total to 100. Or am I being too bearish here? Thanks, Tim, for the question. We'll go to Dan for this. Yes. Maybe I'll answer the second part of the question first, which is around why did the FDA issue the CRL. I think that the FDA regulations actually suggest that FDA should list all deficiencies in the CRL. We were pretty explicit copying some of the FDA's own words here to investors about what was in the CRL. It didn't discuss issues like ARIA, it was focused on the 12-month exposure. So nothing further to speculate there. I think your question on rates of ARIA-E and ARIA-H comparing across drugs is a complicated one. We did this head-to-head study against aducanumab. I think it's important to use studies like that to compare rates of ARIA, because we've learned that rates of ARIA are highly dependent on the type of patients who enroll, the stage of disease and underlying pathology, baseline characteristics of their brain scans, which are different across lecanemab trials and donanemab trials as well as exactly how you do the MRIs and read them.  So I'm personally not going to get worked up about rates of asymptomatic radiographic-only ARIA in any drug. I don't think anyone really understands what that means. What we should be focused on, though, is rates of symptomatic ARIA so patients who have ARIA that turns into something they experience, not just a radiographic binding, and particularly rates of serious adverse events resulting from ARIA. We know that in some patients, ARIA can be dangerous, even fatal as we've seen from lecanemab experiences.  So that's what we'll be looking out for. I think we still have all the caveats about cross-trial comparisons here, but it's a bit easier to compare those symptomatic or serious events.  I think in TRAILBLAZER-1, our numbers were very similar to other members of the class. In TRAILBLAZER-4, the numbers look very, very good for that. And we'll wait and see what we have in TRAILBLAZER-2, but my level of concern over that is not high. The next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Maybe a two-part one from me. I guess, first, on Mounjaro manufacturing. I was just wondering if you can tell us if the FDA has completed the inspection of your new North Carolina facility yet.  And then the other question relates to tirzepatide for obesity. I was wondering if you've had any initial payer conversations yet, and if you're planning to use a priority review voucher for that filing. Thanks, Terence. I think I'll hand over to Anat for commentary on your manufacturing question, and then to Mike on the question about whether there's been any payer conversations on obesity. Terence, to your question on the RTP side, North Carolina, it's progressing on schedule as we had planned. We can't comment on specifics on the FDA interactions, but we're expecting that site to start producing this year, and it's progressing towards that goal.  I will mention, important to think about, when we talk about RTP, I think because of the proximal nature of when this site is going to come online, obviously, this is the next large node that's going to come online in terms of capacity for incretin portfolio. But we are making substantial investments beyond RTP. So we've announced a second site in North Carolina, very large site in Concord. And we've announced the expansion of the RTP side, additional sites in Indianapolis -- or north of Indianapolis and a site in Ireland. And as we look at our capital investments in manufacturing sites this year alone, it's probably the largest we've ever had, doubling what we had in 2022. We're looking at about $3.3 billion of investment just this year.  So we're looking at substantial expansion of capacity really across the globe to support not just Mounjaro, obviously, but the rest of the portfolio. And we have visibility into what's coming as well as the fact that as we've talked about before, we have several products that are part of the same manufacturing network and the same auto-injector platform. So that helps us kind of build that capacity across the Lilly portfolio. Thanks, Anat. Mike, on the second question? Yes. I think a good thing to focus on is access and obesity. I mean you look at the massive size of the obesity market, 110 million people in the U.S., 650 million people globally. But you really see that historically, that the obesity market has really been slow to develop. And it's really because the treatments haven't been adequate.  So the kind of -- the question we had going into this market was if a safe and efficacious treatment was developed, would consumers and health care professionals and payers be interested in using it? Well, based on what we've seen in the marketplace over the past year and on a market research, it's clear that consumers and health care professionals will adopt an efficacious, safe anti-obesity medication if patients can have access to it.  So it does come down to payer access, and we're highly focused on doing that. Novo recently stated in their call that 40 million Americans have access to obesity, and the way they talked about it, what's payer access and employers opting into that.  So if that's where we're at today, that would be a great starting point for access. We're deep into conversations with payers to understand the market and all that. Access discussions haven't started yet, but will shortly. But our focus long term is to improve access for the obesity medications. We are investing significantly to demonstrate the potential health outcome benefits, where people using tirzepatide who live with obesity.  We're also investing in Phase III programs for people who live with obesity and sleep apnea or heart failure, and these should unlock large segments access for people who live with obesity in commercial, and we hope, Part D.  In addition, in my career, I've seen the power of consumer interest in helping to improve access for medication. And what we've seen over the last year is that people who live with obesity are highly engaged and willing to do much to access effective treatments. They will have an important role and voice with employers and the congressional representatives who advocate for access. So while I think it will take time to establish our ultimate access goal, I'm more encouraged than ever by our potential to unlock the obesity market and help a lot of people.  So I'm encouraged, but obviously, a lot of work still to be done. The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. A question for Anat. I'm not going to get the legislative particulars correct. But just to be clear, doesn't Lilly typically guide on tax rate, assuming an adverse U.S. situation and doesn't typically adjust that until late in the year? And this year, it is assuming no adverse situation, but much earlier in the year? If so, can you clarify why you were doing something different this year since it is a profound impact on earnings? And if I could just add on LPA. Dave, Lilly is way behind. How can you catch up? Thanks, Steve. I'll go to Anat for the question on the tax rate assumptions, and then I'll go to Dan for your Lp(a) question. Thanks, Steve. So here is how we look at this, and I wouldn't read too much into it. Last year, we had assumed based on very broad support for change in this 2017 tax provision that this will, in fact, be enacted by Congress. We assumed late in the year, but it hasn't happened. So at this point, the only thing we're doing is reflecting reality of the situation we're in. If it does get repealed or deferred, obviously, we'll update accordingly. I don't think the likelihood of that is zero. So it still could happen this year, but it does take Congress -- Congress will need to act to get this going. So we're simply reflecting the current situation. Okay. I'll start with the Lp(a) question. We have 2 Lp(a) programs. Maybe the easiest one to comment on first is the oral program. And this is a first-in-class, I think probably the only one in clinic here. An oral medication against this target is really a huge feat of molecular engineering. I'm super excited to see the data from this molecule develop and, obviously, the market opportunity for an oral drug for such a widespread condition is very important. In terms of the siRNA, you're right to note that a competitor is ahead of us and really just starting the CVOT study. It's a long road to get these drugs to market with outcome studies are needed here to show the benefit. I probably don't get into our differentiation strategy. But of course, we have some ideas here, and we'll move as quickly as possible. I don't see this as a winner-take-all space. Maybe just to add, Steve, add on the Lp(a) comment. I think we feel good about where we are with that. But just on the tax thing, there is a difference here where you described it as adverse or beneficial, right? So the -- from a GAAP and non-GAAP accounting, of course, it's a benefit on EPS growth. But actually, from a cash perspective, it goes the other way. So we just wanted to be clear upfront because it's not a one-way benefit we're taking early in the year. There's an adverse cash impact throughout the year and a positive effect on the P&L. It's a little bit different from maybe past assumptions we've made. The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. So I wanted to ask you, what do you think is the minimum amount of relative risk reduction you'd have to see in an outcome study for obesity for payers to be convinced that there's something here? Thanks, Louise. Mike, do you want to chime in on that around the minimum amount of relative risk reduction we'd expect in an outcome study for obesity? Yes. That's a good question. I mean first of all, I don't think it's a binary point where all payers are looking for that outcome in order to provide access. I think you're going to see a lot of payers, you already see a lot of payers who provide access for that. And we have an extensive Phase III program not only in CV outcomes, but also the sleep apnea and heart failure to begin to really talk about heart outcomes for many patients who live with obesity.  With the CV outcomes that we have today, I mean, we're quite confident in our program. And based on what we see with surrogate risk reduction in blood pressure and in lipids, we're fairly confident in our CV profile as well as what we saw with the SURPASS data and our meta-analysis in the SURPASS program.  So I won't give you the exact number, but I think we're pleased with where we're at. And I think we'll be able to demonstrate outcomes that payers will be excited about. And that comes from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Okay. Looks like we don't have Dave or he's on mute. The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. If I can ask a question on Mounjaro and the interplay with Trulicity. You've commented in the past that in terms of patients on Mounjaro, it has been about less than 10%. That seems to be a little bit higher now. Can you share any thoughts and observations about how you see this progressing on the forward through this year? Thanks, Chris, for the question. Mike, we'll go to you for that question on the, I guess, cannibalization from Trulicity figure and how that will progress. Okay. Yes. I mean on that, nothing has changed over what we had talked about earlier, that less than 10% of our scripts we get for Mounjaro come from Trulicity. That hasn't changed over time. It's still a little bit less than 10%. And that comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. There's been a heightened investor focus I feel along the Phase III primary endpoint for donanemab now. And I wonder if there's been any incremental interactions and/or agreement with FDA on the primary endpoint for Phase III. It's a question that I get a lot from investors.  And also, how are you thinking about this upcoming Phase III? If there were to be a scenario where the MMRM on CDR doesn't agree with iADRS on a patient analysis? Thanks, Umer. We'll go to Dan for the question on endpoints. Yes. Thanks. Clearly, I think there's a lot we can learn from competitor readouts here. And so looking at lecanemab data, in our eyes, I think it actually further validates an endpoint like iADRS. If you just look at the forest plot, for example, there's a lot more homogeneity in effect on an endpoint like iADRS versus CDR Sum of Boxes. So we feel more confident, I would say, than ever before that an endpoint like that is the right way to go.  On the other hand, I think the -- you could take the position that since lecanemab hit CDR Sum of Boxes, people might say, \"Well, then it's achievable, and you guys should do it, too.\" So there's some pushes and some takes there. But on the whole, still feeling good about iADRS as a primary outcome.  When you ask, though, what happens if you hit one outcome and not the other? That's surely a difficult situation to be in. We want to understand why that happened. If that were to happen, where the irregularities in CDR Sum of Boxes that could explain it, what did the rest of the secondaries look like? Always best to hit all of your outcomes in a clinical trial. Failing that, you want to hit your primary in as many secondaries as possible. So let's wait and see. That question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Maybe a question regarding your next-generation Alzheimer's drug. I cannot pronounce the name, but remternetug. I mean I'll learn it. But how does it differ, is similar versus donanemab? Asking -- because I mean, you're running a Phase III trial with subcu here. So what would be the read-through for this particular asset based on the outcome of donanemab Phase III trial? Dan, do you want to talk a little bit about remternetug? Yes. I think you've got it basically right. Remternetug is a new medicine, a new molecule, but it's an antibody against the same type of epitope that donanemab has, which is this N3pG form of A beta. So a very equivalent mechanism of action. Maybe a little better potency and certainly better drug properties, including no ADAs and formulation things. So the rationale here is to give improved dosing options to patients.  Could we get even faster plaque clearance, could it be with fewer doses, could it be subcutaneous? Those are the types of things that we're currently exploring. The Phase III is designed with a bit of a run-in. We're in that portion right now to finalize our dosing strategy and then expand it.  Obviously, if donanemab is disappointing, there would be read-through through remternetug. On the other hand, if donanemab exceeds expectations, I would expect that to read through as well. The next question is Evan Seigerman from BMO. While much of the discussion on Medicare coverage is in Alzheimer's, we know that Medicare really doesn't pay for obesity drugs. Can you just talk about your efforts to help Medicare patients get coverage for obesity drugs, including potentially Mounjaro, if unapproved. Maybe add some parameters around what that additional population could look like from a revenue opportunity perspective. Thanks, Evan, for the question. I'll hand over to Mike. Mike, do you want to talk about the potential for Medicare to cover obesity? Okay. Sure. Yes, good question. I mean it's going to take legislative action in order to allow the obesity medications to be covered on Medicare Part D. So there is the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act. The acronym for that is TROA. And there's a large growing bipartisan support for TROA, a little over 100 congressmen and senators, Congress people and senators are behind the program. And it's growing more and more support across Washington. We're eager to see an advanced [indiscernible]  Process. It would be great for the company, country. America needs to take action and drastically reduce the number of people living with obesity, and this [ sort of solution ] would be an important step for this goal. We'll also support the [ solution ] and continue to work to advocate for it. The next question is from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics released their guidelines to treat childhood obesity. In those guidelines, they recommended a lifestyle intervention, obviously, is the core component. But also, they said they would consider treatment with anti-obesity medications. So I thought what's your thoughts on anti-obesity medications in children? Is this a scenario that you are moving into or considering moving into? Do you have any trials with children or adolescents? Thanks, Trung, for the question. Mike, over to you again, comment on these recent guidelines that were put out. Yes. Thanks. I mean this is a significant unmet need. Back to the question that we asked earlier about the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act. We need to improve the health of America. We have too many people who live with obesity in the U.S., and that includes, unfortunately, adolescents and kids. So I think they took the right action in order to really identify this as an issue that health care professionals do need to pay close attention to. We obviously always advocate for diet and exercise is the first approach of this. But if that's not successful, then your really only option at that point is medication treatment. We do think it's important and responsible for us to test tirzepatide in kids and adolescents, and we have activity ongoing to do that. The next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Great. I guess one for Anat. Back in December, you highlighted austerity measures in Europe as a potential risk. At that time, that was a bit of a unique position. We hadn't heard that from many companies. Since that time, we've heard kind of similar messaging from some but not all. And apologies if I missed it, I don't think I heard anything today on this front. So I know it's only been sort of 45 days or so since you made those comments, but any advances in sort of how you're thinking about this? And any specific products or countries we should think about that impact? Thanks, Carter, for the question. I'm actually going to hand this over to Ilya Yuffa, who's our President of Lilly International, to comment on the European austerity measures. Yes, I appreciate the question. There have been a number of markets in Europe that have taken some austerity measures, partially due to Ukraine crisis and energy crisis and inflation in Europe. We have seen Germany, France, obviously, the U.K. voluntary system, we think, is broken, and so we exited that. And so we -- there are some austerity measures in there. We've contemplated that into our guidance for '23. And the overall impact is modest relative to historical declines in price in prior years. We expect that to continue to be in that mid-single-digit decline in price in Europe. The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. A question on U.S. commercial access for GLP-1 agonist. First, could you share with us how you're thinking about modeling, the impact of the IRA in terms of GLP-1 uptake increasing as a result of the co-pay cap? And is that additionally benefiting from the reduction in free drug program. How significant is it given the patients still got to find $2,000 per annum?  And then second, in relation to the oral DPP-4 market, which is still a very, very substantial $14 billion market. You have a category of drugs extensively, which may offer considerable advantages in efficacy for glycemia and weight. But I'm reminded of the stickiness of the [ scenario you're with ] in the prior period. To what extent do you think managed market is going to preclude your ability to penetrate that segment with all GLP-1s just on the basis of generic DPP-4s? Thanks, Andrew, for the wide-ranging question on diabetes. I'll hand over to Mike first to talk about your question regarding potential impact of the IRA on access for GLP-1. And then the second question around how oral GLP might fit in given the stickiness of some of the older diabetes medications. Mike? Yes. Good questions. On the IRA side of it, it will benefit patients who live with diabetes who use GLPs and are in Medicare Part D. Out-of-pocket cost will go down. We have, I would say, a small or moderate impact on GLP sales or just probably lower rates of abandonment than what we'd see at higher out-of-pocket costs.  As it comes to the oral DPP-4, the perceptions of oral DPP-4s have really declined over the last 5 years and really being replaced by SGLT-2s and GLP lose. So I don't see much of an impact of DPP-4s going off path in the U.S. or other markets. And that's from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Great. I was just thinking more about some of the launches that are coming up, but I know these maybe a [ little were out ]. But for mirikizumab, and I always get this wrong, sorry. But for UC, can you just talk a little bit about given how much promotion there's been for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ as you move into also Crohn's with data reading out soon. Like how do you see like competing in that market? Can you start launching? Do you have to be DTC heavy because it seems like they're very prominent? Like what about the launch dynamics? And then second, for lebrikizumab, the same question here. Atopic dermatitis is getting pretty crowded. What kind of pushes and pulls might you need to use to get quicker uptake in atopic derm? Thanks, Robyn, for the questions. I will go to Patrik Jonsson for both of these, first on mirikizumab and competition in the UC market and then on lebrikizumab. Patrik? Thank you very much. Well, overall, we feel very good with the data we have seen on mirikizumab. If we look at the 52 weeks, we have more than 50% clinical remission, and we see statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both clinical, symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic endpoints.  What I think is important that if you look at the patient populations with ulcerative colitis, we saw the same results across the bio-naïve and the bio-failure patients. So I think we're extremely well positioned for the launch here. We also demonstrated [ on a factor ], but it's extremely important for patients, bowel urgency. More than 40% of patients were either completely or almost bowel urgency treated at week 52.  So therefore, we believe we have a first-in-class asset here that probably initially will be used mainly second line for those that haven't responded appropriately to TNFs and similar. But we believe that long term, we are positioned for a first-line placement in treatment of ulcerative colitis.  And yes, so the outlook for mirikizumab, it's exciting from a competitive landscape perspective. We don't have to have data. But if we compare the data we have seen so far, we believe that miri compares very favorable both versus what's currently in the marketplace as well as what's in the pipeline with other companies across JAK inhibitors, S1Ps and other IL-23s as well. So exciting to launch miri the first half of this year.  When it comes to lebri, I think actually, we are uniquely positioned to really upgrade the expected outcomes of patients with atopic dermatitis. We have here an asset that is actually targeting the most relevant cytokine when it comes to treating atopic dermatitis, IL-13. And it does that with a high binding affinity, high potency and a slow off-rate. And I think that probably explains the data that we have seen so far. We're extremely pleased with the Phase III data, and we saw more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at week 16, maintaining that at week 52. But also very importantly, statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both each, which is probably the most disturbing factor for patients with atopic dermatitis, sleep and quality of life. And we saw similar results across both the Q2W and Q4W formulation.  We actually believe that lebrikizumab has the potential to become a first-line biologic. It's important to have in mind that we announced the submission at the Q3 earnings call, and we expect that traditional regulatory pathway. Yes, we will not launch until most likely Q4 of 2023.  But a lot of excitement from both health care providers, the top-tier community as well on the payers to get leverage to the market. Thank you, Patrik. Dave, to wrap up? Great. I think that's the last question. I appreciate the questions across the portfolio. And we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company.  2022 was another productive year for the company, and we generated strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients we serve. We aim to continue our momentum in 2023 and execute on the meaningful launch and pipeline opportunities that we have ahead of us.  So thanks for dialing in, and please follow up with IR if you have questions that we didn't get to today. Have a great day. Thank you.

         "Welcome to the Q4 2022 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is [indiscernible], and I will be your operator for today's call.  [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the call over to Phil Gresh, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Yes. Thank you, operator, and welcome to everyone joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On the call today are several members of the ConocoPhillips' leadership team, including Ryan Lance, Chairman and CEO; Bill Bullock, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dominic Macklon, Executive Vice President of Strategy, Sustainability and Technology; Nick Olds, Executive Vice President of Lower 48; Andy O'Brien, Senior Vice President of Global Operations; and Tim Leach, adviser to the CEO.  Ryan and Bill will kick off the call with opening remarks, after which the team will be available for your questions. A few quick reminders: First, along with today's release, we published supplemental financial materials and a presentation which you can find on our Investor Relations website.  Second, during this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results may differ due to factors noted in today's release and in our periodic SEC filings.  Finally, to make -- we will make reference to some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in today's release and on our website.  With that, I will turn the call over to Ryan. Thanks, Phil, and thank you to everyone for joining our fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call.  As we sit here today, there are a number of cross-currents in the global economy. While the energy sector is not immune to potential macro headwinds, our fundamental outlook remains constructive. On the demand side, we think that growth will continue in 2023, aided by a normalization in China mobility following the lifting of COVID restrictions. On the supply side, we believe the continued producer discipline and the expected impacts of Russian oil and product sanctions are likely to keep balances tight. So while commodity prices are currently not as high as they averaged in 2022, we see duration to this up cycle.  Now stepping back, we remain steadfast in our view that a successful energy transition must meet society's fundamental need for secure, reliable and affordable energy while also progressing towards a lower carbon future. While we all recognize the challenges that global energy policymakers face to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is clear that doing so requires an all-the-above approach. This can be done by enacting policies that encourage the development of lower emission energy sources and oil and gas resources.  These policies should include efforts aimed at fiscal stability, streamlining of the permitting process, increased transparency on timelines and supporting critical infrastructure. These are not just necessary for the oil and gas industry, but also for nuclear, hydrogen and renewables, all of which will be necessary to deliver on the energy transition.  At the end of the day, it's critical for our administration to remember that North American energy production is a stabilizing force for both global energy security and meeting energy transition demand. Meeting that demand will require investments in medium and long cycle projects in addition to short-cycle U.S. shale. This is why you see ConocoPhillips leaning a bit further across our deep and diversified portfolio in 2023, whether it's the Lower 48, where we achieved record production in 2022 or our diversified global portfolio, ConocoPhillips is well positioned to meet the world's long-term energy needs while also reducing our own emissions footprint.  Shifting to our 2022 performance. ConocoPhillips showed continuous strong execution across our triple mandate. We generated a trailing 12-month return on capital employed of 27%, the highest since the spin. We delivered on our plan to return $15 billion of capital to our shareholders, which represented 53% of our CFO, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual through-the-cycle commitment, and we further advanced our net zero operational emissions ambition with a new medium-term methane intensity target consistent with our recent commitment to joining OGMP 2.0.  Now looking ahead, ConocoPhillips is well positioned to further deliver on our triple mandate in 2023 with a well-balanced capital allocation strategy. This morning, we announced a plan to return $11 billion of capital to shareholders, which represents about 50% of our forecasted CFO at $80 WTI.  The other half of our cash flow will be dedicated to reinvesting in the business. From a portfolio perspective, our deep and well-diversified asset base is well positioned to generate solid cash flow growth for decades to come. This is further evidenced by our organic reserve replacement ratio of 177% in 2022. We're also enthusiastic about our new LNG opportunities we are participating in, in Qatar and the United States, which are highly complementary to our existing LNG business, and we look forward to providing you a comprehensive update about our long-term strategy and our financial outlook at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Meeting on April 12 at the New York Stock Exchange.  Now let me turn the call over to Bill to cover our fourth quarter performance and 2023 guidance in a bit more detail. Thanks, Ryan. Starting with fourth quarter results. We generated $2.71 in adjusted earnings per share. Fourth quarter production was 1,758,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which included a 27,000 barrel a day negative impact from weather in the Lower 48. Lower 48 production averaged 997,000, including 671,000 from the Permian, 214,000 from the Eagle Ford and 96,000 from the Bakken.  Moving to cash flow. Fourth quarter CFO was $6.5 billion excluding working capital at an average WTI price of $83 per barrel. APLNG distributions were $639 million and fourth quarter capital expenditures were $2.5 billion, including $2.1 billion of base capital and $300 million for acquisitions and North Field East payments.  On capital allocation, we returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through ordinary dividends, VROC payments and share buybacks while also reducing gross debt by $400 million. Full year CFO was $28.5 billion, excluding working capital at an average WTI price of $94 per barrel in 2022. Full year APLNG distributions were $2.2 billion and full year total CapEx was $10.2 billion with base CapEx achieving our guidance of $8.1 billion and $2.1 billion of acquisitions in North Field East payments. Full year return of capital was $15 billion, while $3.4 billion went to debt reduction with cash and short-term investments ending the year at $9.5 billion.  Turning to 2023 guidance. We forecast full year production will be in a range of 1.76 million to 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents 1% to 4% of organic growth. Our first quarter production guidance range is 1.72 million to 1.76 million, which includes $35,000 of planned maintenance, primarily in Qatar and the Lower 48. Our full year planned maintenance is expected to be similar to 2022.  On capital spending, we expect a range of $10.7 billion to $11.3 billion, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. We expect operating costs of $8.2 billion, DD&A of $8.1 billion and corporate segment net loss of $900 million.  For 2023 cash flow, we forecast $22 billion in CFO at $80 barrel WTI, 85 Brent and 325 Henry Hub at current strip prices for regional differentials. Included in our cash flow forecast is $1.9 billion in APLNG distributions with $600 million expected in the first quarter.  Now regarding CapEx, we provide a waterfall in our prepared materials bridging 2022 actual spending to 2023 guidance. Starting with base capital spending. We forecast an increase from $8.1 billion in 2022 to a range of $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion in 2023. The remaining $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion is allocated to longer-term projects. Of this amount, $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion is for LNG projects, which includes Port Arthur, North Field East and North Field South. For Port Arthur specifically, after factoring in expected project financing, we forecast that ConocoPhillips net investment will be just under $2 billion over the 5-year investment period.  However, more than half of this capital investment will be in 2023. For Willow, we're guiding to $100 million to $400 million of incremental spending with the high end of this range, assuming that the project is sanctioned this year.  In summary, we're happy with our strong 2022 results, which would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our talented workforce. And we are well positioned to balance investing in our deep and diversified portfolio this year while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders.  That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Phil. Great. Thanks, Bill. As a reminder, just before we go to the Q&A, we ask that you please keep it to one question and a follow-up. With that, [indiscernible], we're ready to turn it over to you for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]  Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Yes. Our first question is around Willow and recognize there's still some gating factors to getting it towards FID, but it seems to be moving in the right direction. So just talk about how you're thinking about that project, what remains outstanding to get it to FID and then any thoughts on costs as well. The latest number we have is $8 billion all in. Is that still good to go by? Or how should we think about that? Neil, this is Andy. Yes, there's been a lot of moving parts on Willow since the last earnings call. So let me just step through where we are in the overall approval process and then I can clear where we are with CapEx and scope. So with the approval process, I think most people saw that the final supplemental environmental impact statement was released by the Biden administration earlier this week. Now that should be published in the federal register in the next day or so and then that starts the required 30-day clock before the ROD can be issued. Now given the Biden administration's commitment to the Alaska congressional delegation, we then expect to receive that ROD in the first week of March. Once the ROD has been issued, our focus for 2023 will be to immediately initiate gravel road construction, ramp-up fabrication and supply chain activities. Now we're going to need to take a look at the ROD in some detail, but assuming it's consistent with the BLM's 3-pad preferred alternative, and there are no new unworked restrictions added, we would then proceed to final investment decision.  So switching to CapEx. 2023 is very dependent on the ROD timing. And as Bill mentioned, we've given a range. So with the ROD timing, any resolutions of outstanding issues, what we're guiding is about $100 million to $400 million of incremental spend in 2023. In terms of the total project costs, we have recently gone out to market to update our cost estimates, and we have seen some inflationary pressures.  We've also refined the scope, including an update to accommodate the BLM's 3-pad preferred alternative. So we're in the process of finalizing our cost estimates, but we'd anticipate the AFE to first production to be in the $7 billion to $7.5 billion range. Of the increase versus the update we provided in 2021, it has been about 50-50 between inflation and scope refinement. So that gives you a pretty good update on where we are with Willow. And then at our April Investor Day, we'll be happy go into some more details. And that 7.5%, Andy, compares to [indiscernible], it sounds like, it would be the apples-to-apples. And then... That's correct. That's an apples-to-apples. And then the follow-up is just around return of capital. Last year was an outstanding year, 53% back to shareholders of the cash flow. And the guidance this year, $11 billion also implies very strong return of capital number. I know we often anchored to the 30% or greater than 30%. But is the message we should be interpreting that there's a new normal here around return of capital and the bar has been reset higher? No, we're not trying to message that. What I remind people is the 30% commitment that we have is through the cycle commitment. We've also signaled to -- or we have also told the shareholders that when prices are above our mid-cycle price, you should expect higher distributions for the company, and that's consistent with what we've done over the last number of years. So as we look today, where the strip is trading where the regional differentials are at, we've kind of picked $11 billion at an $80 price deck. So that's how we're going into the year.  It represents about 50% of our cash flow. But again, that 80 is well above our mid-cycle price in our commitments tied to -- through the cycle kind of mid-cycle price call, and it just represents that we are constructive with the environment that we see today, and we expect the prices to be above our mid-cycle price call, which should inform that the distributions would be above that 30% as well. Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. So Bill, I think I didn't actually get to write down the numbers quickly enough. Could you just go through again the expected cadence of the 3 LNG projects. Full disclosure, I think we had expected a slower pace on Sempra or in Port Arthur, I guess. So can you just walk us through what you -- how you expect that cadence to look please? That would be really helpful. I've got a follow-up, please. Yes. Sure, Doug. I'm happy to. So let me just kind of start with a bit of a high-level view. We've put a bridge from 2022 to '23 in our documents for today. And I'll just -- I'll start with kind of our exit rate. So if you look at our fourth quarter base capital spend, that would annualize out to about $8.9 billion with a low single-digit inflation rate versus '22 exit rate. And we've got some phasing in Norway and the additional incremental emissions reduction that gets you to about 9.2, which is midpoint of our guidance. And then really, the incremental spend is on LNG projects in Willow and that gets us to $11 billion midpoint of the guidance range.  And I think that the primary issue here on cadence is likely the front-end nature of Port Arthur LNG spend, which really the market had no way of knowing. So as you'll recall, Sempra has communicated a Phase 1 gross cost of $10.5 billion for the EPC, on top of which there's going to be owners' costs and other miscellaneous costs to bring the project online.  And Doug, the project currently lining up debt financing for a portion of the spend, so you roll that all together, we would expect our 30% share of the net equity capital to be just under $2 billion over the 5-year investment period. But the front-end nature of equity component is going to result in over half of that $2 billion occurring in 2023. That's what we've included in our 2023 capital guidance.  Now the project is still waiting on FID, but we do expect that in the first quarter, and we will be talking to you more about this in April. But if you've been modeling a more ratable spend over 5 years for Port Arthur, that would be about $400 million in 2023 or about to $600 million to $700 million less than our guidance. So I think that, that might be some of what you're seeing in kind of the LNG spend, and I think it's obvious with over half of the Port Arthur spend in 2023, obviously, the spending in 2024 and beyond is going to be less than a ratable rate. But I think that's probably the main gap in LNG spending that you're seeing. That's really helpful, Bill. And you're exactly right. We were not expecting half. But of course, that means that the other half is probably more ratable, I'm guessing, over time, but that's really helpful. My follow-up is a favorite topic of mine, Bill. I hate to get in the weeds here, but again, another sizable deferred tax credit this quarter, although it does kind of look a little bit more like your -- almost like you're moving to a new normal based on your U.S. spending, thinking IDCs and things of that nature. Can you move just -- am I thinking about that right? Should we be expecting a ratable deferred tax credit going forward in your cash flow? And I'll leave it there. Well, yes. So deferred taxes were a source of $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter, Doug, and we had a source of about $700 million in the third quarter. Now the source of those deferred taxes is primarily due to the impact of intangible drilling costs and generating deferred tax liabilities now that we're in a U.S. cash tax paying position. Now as we look at 2023 at current investment levels, we'd expect deferred taxes are going to continue to generate a source of cash on a normalized basis. But I'd expect the deferred tax source full year to be lower in 2022.  Now we are in a U.S. cash tax paying position for the full year, but we also utilized all significant U.S. net operating losses, NOLs and EOR credit carryforwards in 2022. And that utilization generated a larger source of cash last year compared to what we're going to be seeing in 2023. Our next question comes from Steve Richardson with Evercore. Ryan, there's been a lot of focus on the Permian Basin of late, certainly from an industry perspective, and not all of it has been good, we'd say. And I'd love if you just took a moment and help us differentiate Conoco's assets in the basin, what you're seeing from your asset. And certainly, some of the performance speaks for itself, but I'd love if you could address that today. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Let me make a couple of comments, and then I'll turn it over to Nick for maybe a couple of his thoughts in a bit more detail. We're not worried about our long-term development plans in the Lower 48. We see durability to our plans. And I know there's been a bit of noise about productivity and length and durability. And we've been there for a long time. We know what we're doing after the acquisitions that we made over the last 1.5 years. And I don't have any concerns about the durability to length, the efficiency of our program. And maybe I'll let Nick provide a few more detail and color on that comment. Yes, so I'll give a little more color on that one. Let me start with just the well performance that we're seeing versus the tight curves. So if you look at our 2022 development wells, they've been performing slightly above the curve expectations across all 4 basins, including the Permian Basin. And that strong performance reinforces and validates the development plans that Ryan just mentioned, which is our focus on maximizing returns and recovery while minimizing the future interference. So if we step back in time, we've been incorporating a lot of the learning curve from our developments over the past 3 to 4 years.  In fact, when you look at our accelerated learning curve, we've drilled the most horizontal wells in the Delaware and Midland Basin, more than any other company. So when you combine that data along with our significant operated by others portfolio and then the learnings in our mature development in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, that's really helped us hone in on the best development approach of the stack.  So in summary, Steve, if you look at our production performance at or slightly exceeding type curve expectations, combined with the development strategy, we're very confident in our long-term outlook for these assets and we'll update you more at AM. That's great. I really appreciate it. I mean if I could -- just one quick follow-up, Nick. Could you just address the 25,000 acres of swaps and coring up that you mentioned this morning, I would, I mean one of the questions, I guess, is... No, we didn't catch your question. Thanks. Sorry, it must be the phone line. The question is on the -- you have the 25,000 acres on the core up. And I'm just wondering if you could address, Nick, how much more to go is there on that side? And where are you just looking at the checkerboard of the map down there? Yes, Steve. Maybe I'll just go back for the whole audience on what we've done in that space. We've been very focused on the acreage optimization, as you mentioned on trades and swaps. Last year, we completed 15 trades, and that gives us a total about 25,000 acres since the Concho transaction. Now a couple of points I just want to address. These core ups have doubled the average laterally of more than a year's worth of inventory, that's at our current level of drilling activity. Now the ability to drill extended laterals greater than 1 mile can reduce our cost of supply by 30% to 40%. So that's significant.  Now to put that in perspective, Steve, our quality position in the Permian has an inventory with roughly 60% of our wells that are greater than 2-mile laterals, 60%. And then if you look at 1.5 miles or greater, that's an additional 20%. So that's a robust inventory that we have out there.  Now if you will continue to, as you mentioned, the core up in 2023 through acreage and swaps there, but we've got a significant deep robust inventory with those longer laterals. Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. So my first question is just kind of a broad one on the upcoming Investor Day. You guys haven't done one for several years. Anything on what we can expect from the presentation in terms of the longer-term plan? Or maybe a breakdown of certain assets or projects. So just any color on that would be great. Yes, John, thanks. So we -- I think we'll show how we're pretty excited about where the company has gone. We've got a better plan. It's the strategic and the financial plan of the company and got better duration, better depth, and we'll show that to you what it means for the company for decades to come. I mean -- so we're pretty excited about where it's at. We'll do a deeper dive into where we're at in the Lower 48, our global portfolio as well as the LNG business that we've been developing here over the last 1.5 years. So look forward to sharing kind of our excitement around our plans, where it's headed and just the quality of what we're doing both strategically and financially. Great. And then just a question on the guidance for 1Q production, a little bit below the full year guide and you guys called out the maintenance number there. But maybe just some color on would be helpful on how you expect production to phase in throughout the year? Should we expect it to be more back-end loaded or maybe more towards the middle, given the later 1Q? John, it's Dominic here. So yes, I think as Bill remarked, we do have above-normal seasonal maintenance in the first quarter. That's at Qatar Train 6 and 7, but also Eagle Ford [indiscernible]  our stabilizer facility down there. We've actually been preparing that for a bit of expansion. So that explains the Q1 sort of rate. But thereafter, our expectation is that each quarter will be around 2% to 3% year-on-year growth. So that's really our base case. Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. First one, maybe following up on Neil's question on the cash return for the year, we realize that it's still early in the year, but you've already declared the ROC for the first part of the year. How are you ultimately thinking about the split of the $11 billion of total cash return between cash and buyback, and is the buyback more of a function of your mid-cycle price assumptions? Yes. I think the majority of our buyback is tied back to ratably buying our shares in our mid-cycle price assumptions. So we try to ratably buy some shares as we go through the year. And then we buy some variable shares depending on where we see the market. I would say, as we're going into 2023, right now, we're thinking roughly 50%, 50% between cash and shares in terms of the absolute return back to the shareholders. So the $11 billion would be split roughly 5.5 and 5.5. That's our thinking as we start the year, but we'll watch the commodity price and where things develop as we go through the course of the year. Okay. Very helpful. I'll pencil that in. Our second question, sticking with '23, but moving to CapEx here. We noticed that there's about $500 million to $600 million of incremental inflation included in the budget versus 2022. And there's some noise with the categorization of the Port Arthur spend. But it looks like Lower 48 will comprise about 60% of total CapEx for '23. And so our question is, how much of that $500 million to $600 million of incremental inflation is in the Permian and Lower 48 versus maybe other parts of your portfolio? And what's your estimate on how inflation ended up by region in '22? And maybe any assumptions that you have in your budget for '23 inflation? Yes. Let me take a quick high-level shot. I think if you're kind of looking at exit rates from 2022 going into 2023, it's kind of low-single digits. If you're kind of looking at what's the increase annually year-over-year, it's more like mid-single digits. I think the difference we're seeing this year maybe relative to last year is we see that mid-single-digit inflation applying across the whole global portfolio and it's slightly higher in the Permian to the question that you asked.  So yes, we're in -- we're seeing some categories of spend that are key to the company actually start to plateau and maybe even roll over a little bit, one that -- one we're watching pretty closely is OCTG, the tubulars, some of the raw materials that are going into making those are starting to come down and be slight a little bit. So we're starting to see that category spend sort of roll over. We're seeing the rate of increase kind of in the onshore rig market start to lessen a little bit, which is good. We need that -- and so when we kind of wrap all those categories to spend together for the company, it kind of manifests itself in an annual year-over-year inflation in the mid-single digits. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Maybe a follow-up on the Permian. I'm not sure if you mentioned this earlier, but can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in your current guidance, I guess, both capital and production for the year. It sounds like the guide assumes kind of flat activity levels in the Permian versus late 2022. Is that correct? And in terms of how should we think about activity levels? And how should we think about the trajectory of production in the Permian over the course of 2023? Yes, Ryan, this is Nick. Yes, let me talk -- walk you through that. So as you mentioned, we've assumed a level-loaded steady-state program for 2023 based on that second half of 2022 for rigs and frac crews. The focus for this year will really be around improving capital and operating efficiency. Now we do expect some modest growth in partner activity as the year progresses. And then we have some larger operated pads that will come online in kind of 2Q, 3Q.  So our Lower 48 plan will deliver production in that mid-single digits, with the majority of that growth weighted to the Permian. Now with respect to the profile shape, it will be kind of mid- to back-end weighted in 2023. And as we talked about, Dominic mentioned this, we do have that Eagle Ford, Sugarloaf stabilizer maintenance that's going on. And actually, I'm pleased to mention that the turnaround that Dominic referred to is 5 days, and we completed that successfully in January. Now we will have a little bit of brownfield modifications on that stabilizer through mid-February as well. And then I'll mention 2 kind of month-to-month, we'll have wells, a little bit of lumpiness. But in the back end, we'll be weighted in 2023 for a production profile. Great. That's very helpful. And then -- as we think about your emerging kind of global gas strategy, how should we think about your approach to the gas portfolio on these projects? Should we expect the majority sold under long-term contracts with a percentage held for spot cells when you look to correspondingly build out your global gas trading capability similar to our European peers? And maybe as you're out marketing these volumes, are you seeing anything to comment on in terms of the environment, whether global gas tightness is helping the sales pricing out there? So any high-level views on your global gas strategy there would be great. Yes, sure. This is Bill. So I'll just start with -- we've got a really strong understanding and presence in the LNG market and have had for several years. We're regularly selling spot volumes into Asia of our APLNG venture. And we do think that Europe is going to be a long-term market for U.S. Gulf Coast and you will have seen where we recently secured regas capacity in Germany, which we're really happy about and excited about.  And so we're looking at the best options in terms of long-term placements, but these are 20-year projects off the Gulf Coast. And so we think that the long-term strength of international pricing relative to U.S. gas is going to be pretty interesting. And that driver and that strength in LNG, we think, it's going to be driven by its role in energy transition and reducing carbon emissions. So as you see us build out our LNG portfolio over the next few years, we may take some longer-term contract decisions in there. But right now, we're not really disclosing where we're at for competitive reasons in terms of how we're developing that market. Our next question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. So I wanted to first follow up on some of the CapEx questions earlier. You laid out the $1.6 billion to $2 billion of spending this year on major projects, and you talked with some good detail about Port Arthur. It's not necessarily ratable across the projects. But when you put it all together, I was wondering if you could talk about how you see the magnitude of major projects been evolving or changing over the next few years outside of Port Arthur and some of the key moving pieces that we should be thinking about across the projects that could move that number higher or lower? Yes. I think we tried to explain kind of a bit about the front-end loading of the Port Arthur project. So you ought to expect that's going to come down as you look into the 2, 3, 4 years. Some of the other moving pieces, we -- if the commodity price environment supports it, we want to see some ramp in our Lower 48 activities up to our optimized plateau across the various assets. You'll see Willow ramping up if we get an adequate project approval from the federal government. So that will come in. And then obviously, there's some inflationary forces as well as we think about where it's going. So there's a lot of moving pieces, but that's kind of how you should think of the different pieces that we're looking at as we kind of think about the longer-term nature of the capital, and we'll be prepared to talk about that at our analyst meeting coming up in April. Got it. Makes sense. Just a quick follow-up on NFE and NFS, are those fairly ratable over the next few years? Any additional color on those projects specifically? Yes. So this is Bill. You saw us in the fourth quarter and make our initial catch-up payment on NFE. And then you should expect that those projects are funding through the next couple of years. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia General. Can I go back into Permian? You guys talking about earlier in your prepared remarks on the inventory for the 2-mile well. I think the industry also think that the 3-mile may actually was even better. Can you talk about that? I mean, based on where you are today, what's the inventory then on the 3 miles? And whether there's a lot of opportunity there. You also don't know whether there's an update you can provide on the [indiscernible] longer-term petrol rate that you expect for Permian and that when that you will be able to get there. So that's the first question.  The second question that I have to say, I was super impressed that your Bakken production is actually flat sequentially from the third quarter given that the winter storm hit and so severely, I mean, how the 27,000 barrels per day, I mean, how much is on the Bakken and how you'd be able to get it so that you can actually get it flat? All right. Yes. This is Nick. I'll just kind of walk you back through kind of the inventory related to our longer laterals as we've done the core up. Again, over 60% is greater than 2-mile laterals, and that does include the 3 miles as well. So that's a significant part of our inventory in the Permian Basin. We've actually, this last year, in 2022, brought on, I think, more than 30 wells that are in the 3-mile category and are seeing very encouraging results. So we'll continue to execute those as we go forward. As we continue to core up and do swaps, that will give us more inventory as well for that longer lateral execution. Again, you will see probably cost of supply of about 30% to 40% reduction as we drill those longer laterals. I'm sorry, Dominic, for the 60% you're talking about, how much of -- what percent of them is actually in the 3 miles category? Yes, Paul, I don't have that in front of me at this point in time, but let's wait until AM and I'll give you a further update on that overall 3-mile categorization.  On your second part of that first question related to plateau. Again, we'll update the group on overall Permian plateau, Eagle Ford and Bakken at the April 12 Investor Day. Obviously, there's a number of factors that go into that. The macro, maintaining execution, efficiency, continuing to capture the learning curve and capital efficiency. Right now, with our middle -- mid-single-digit growth, we feel that's right in line with what we've communicated earlier.  And then your second question was related to weather. Glad you brought that one up. Again, Bill, you had mentioned 27,000 barrels a day for fourth quarter 2022. Just a quick breakdown on that. That's 13,000 for Permian, 10,000 for Bakken and then last 4,000 in Eagle Ford. I think you asked kind of maybe quarter-to-quarter, Q3 to Q4, you're right, it was flat. We're at 96,000 barrels equivalent per day. And Paul, the main driver for that is what we had some really strong operated wells that carried into Q4. And then on the operated by others, we had some larger pad projects come online in Q4 that offset that weather. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. A bit of an old-school question on your reserve replacement. Historically, LNG FIDs were big blocky chunks of gas reserves going into the portfolio. That's not really going to be the case for a midstream asset like Port Arthur. But I'm curious, can you go into a little more detail on the oil gas mix shift on the reserve replacement? And how to think about the cadence of LNG coming in through that? Bob, it's Dominic here. Yes. So let me talk a bit about that. I mean, we're obviously very pleased with our organic reserve replacement ratio this year, 177%. The real drivers for that, I mean, obviously, the LNG, we did have some bookings there for NFE as we commenced payments on NFE. We also saw some bookings [indiscernible] LNG performance and for some project advancements in Norway. Our international portfolio is contributing. But the main area this year was actually in the Lower 48 development program. And that's particularly in the Permian and that included an increase to our PUD bookings by extending the approved area established by reliable technology, which is an SEC term. So it's consistent with SEC requirements. And so basically, we have a very extensive geoscience and reservoir engineering data set across the Permian now that allows us to support that. So -- and you'll be aware, Bob, just the rigor and the process and the controls governing the reserves booking process. So this further demonstrates the depth and quality of our Lower 48 inventory. So that's really the story this year. Going forward, we'll continue to see bookings in the Lower 48, we'll see bookings in Alaska, obviously, with pending FIDs. And then we'll continue to see some LNG bookings as well, particularly on the resource projects as we call them, NFE and NFS, you're absolutely right what you're saying about Port Arthur. So I think you'll see a mix going forward, right, as it stands now, our Lower 48 represents about 46% of our reserves and the remainder across international, but yes, we are certainly appreciating the performance of our sort of diversified portfolio around our reserve booking. So thanks for the question. Very clear. A quick follow-up on the portfolio. Great opportunities in 2020 to rebuild the portfolio, '21 again in the Permian, '22 was very much an LNG theme year. Is the star of the show for '23 Willow FID? Or how do you think about the portfolio where it stands today? We're pretty pleased where the portfolio is at. I mean, Dominic did a good job of kind of going across the globe. I think we spent a lot of time over the last 5 years really coring up the portfolio, really focused on getting it as low cost of supply as we can, getting the margins as expanded as we can, leading to kind of the returns and the productivity that we're seeing today. So we're just hyper focused on making sure the efficiencies are there and the returns are there and pretty happy with where we stand today. And then as you rightly note, Bob, we're leaning in a bit on some of these mid- and longer-cycle projects because we're just very constructive. The world is going to need this all. It's going to need low greenhouse gas and emissions intensity oil. It's going to need low-cost supply oil. That's what we're all about. That's what we're doing in our portfolio. And most recently, leaning in on the LNG side because we think the world is going to need this gas as part of the transition that we're going through. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. My question is around just production and maybe around the Permian. I'm just trying to get a sense of -- you've got, I think, the 4% -- 1% to 4% type overall growth. So I'm just trying to get a sense of expectations for the Permian, if you would back out obviously, what's going on up in Alaska. Have you all clarified or kind of said what the expectation is at and it sounds like a second part of that, it sounds like it's going to be pretty -- that growth you expect in the Permian, I assume that would be pretty linear for the entire year, if you could comment on those 2 things. Yes, Neal, this is Nick. Again, for the Lower 48, we'll deliver production growth in that mid-single digits. And again, the majority of that growth is going to be weighted to the Permian. With respect to the profile shape, it's going to be more of mid- to back-end weighted. So we've got some operated larger pads that are going to be coming on kind of the midyear to third quarter. And then we've got a modest operated by other growth going through the year with more on the kind of the back end for Lower 48. Does that help? That's very clear. And then just one last one. You all are obviously in a fantastic position financially. You've done some really positive M&A deals in the past. I think actually in the last couple of years among the best that I've seen out there. My question that comes in, how do you view the landscape today? I mean obviously, prices are up, maybe commodity prices are up, so maybe expectations are higher, but just wondering, overall, how do you view the M&A landscape? Yes. Thanks, Neal. I mean we're in the market every day. We're trading. We're thinking about the market, we see what's going on every day. We think generally, there's more consolidation that's needed in our business. It's pretty tough at these kinds of elevated prices, but we watch it every day. I think it -- we've been pretty clear and consistent about our financial framework and how we think about M&A. That has not changed. So as we think about cost of supply, we think about assets that we can make better or can make our company better or improve our long-term plan. We know the assets that we like. And so we watch those constantly. But it's a tougher market at these kinds of prices to transact. And some of the transactions that have occurred this year, we've looked at them, we've seen them. We've watched them. They just don't feel our framework. So they don't make us a better company. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Thanks, as always, for the great disclosure. In fact, you guys have been leaders in the industry in many ways, starting with really the first capital discipline, cash return framework. You're in position to make acquisitions at the bottom of the cycle. And now you're saying that you're leaning in is the [indiscernible] sort of mega project development using an $85 oil price assumption. Is this an indication that the industry is going to have to follow you? Or is it more that these major opportunities have come up in 2023? And further to the $85 price assumption, could you just remind me what gas price assumption you're using? And what would you cut if oil prices went to, say, $60 over the course of the year? Yes. Thanks, Paul. No, I think we're -- Yes, I think the -- our view is pretty constructive over the next number of years and through the decade. So the time you want to do some of these big projects sort of front end of the cycle, we probably are a bit unique given our global diversified portfolio. We have opportunities in Alaska and Norway, in the Far East, in the Middle East. So we look at those, make sure they fit our framework around cost of supply and what we want to go invest in. And as we look forward, we believe now is the time to be doing these projects, which is why you see us leaning in on the LNG side. We're constructive on the gas and why we're moving forward with our little project up in Alaska. And [indiscernible] this is what the administration has asked us for, U.S. production, this low GHG emission production. This is exactly what the administration has asked us to do as an industry, and that's what we're trying to do as a company.  Now looking forward, I think we'll talk at aim about where we think mid-cycle price is and frankly, we think it's probably come up from where we've been over the last 5, 6 years. We'll show that to you at AM. And then finally, to your last question, yes, we've set a cash return target at $80 WTI, $85 Brent. And I think it's 325 Henry Hub. Those are the assumptions we made that underpin the $11 billion. The price would have to go down considerably. I mean, you said into the 60s, full year average, I think before we would talk about changing that. And we're prepared to use our cash on the balance sheet to fund these projects. That's why we have that cash. That's why we have that financial strength and that resilience. So we're happy to use the cash if we need to. So I think it's resilient across a broad range of prices in terms of what we've established as our distribution target for the year. And then following on the leadership, you were instrumental in the export ban being lifted. Can you talk a little bit more about Willow? There's obviously some -- you mentioned low GHG. Can you talk a bit about how it fits alongside what you just said about the administration asking for this in terms of its environmental footprint? Yes, it will be some of the lowest GHG emission production in the world, less than 10 kilograms per barrel. So it's going to be something that we believe is what the world needs right now as we go through this energy transition. We need more oil and gas. We need more base load to supply the world reliable and affordable energy and coming from the United States and North America broadly, in general, is the right thing to be doing right now. And it comes from companies like ours that have over 40-year experience on the North Slope. We know how to do this. We know how to do it responsibly and all the stakeholders support it, including the native community on the North Slope, the congressional delegation, the union labor leaders who need this opportunity for employment in Alaska. So there's full alignment behind what we're trying to go do there. It's just the politics in D.C. Our last question comes from Bill Janela with Credit Suisse. I wanted to ask on the pace of CapEx as you move through this year. I'm wondering with all of the major project components that there are some quarters that might be chunkier than others? Or if there are any other timing or seasonal factors to consider? So any guidance you can give there in terms of how to think about the progression of quarterly spending for some of those bigger ticket items as well as the base business would be very helpful. Thanks, Bill. It's Dominic here. Yes, the way it's going to work out, we think, is pretty ratable through the year. we've got consistent activity in the Lower 48 level loaded. You're right that there is going to be a bit of lumpiness around some of the project spend. So for example, in the first quarter, we do have a modest upfront payment in Q1 on Port Arthur, assuming that's sanctioned. But if you are running a fairly ratable profile, that would be a good estimate. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator, I think just wrap up the call. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

         "Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Quarter 4 2022 Financial Results Teleconference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded.   And for opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2022 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.  Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2021.  Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 2, 2023 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.   During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.   Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions; and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and, therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.   And now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Thank you for joining today's call. As Dave mentioned earlier, I'm joined today by Andy Jassy, our CEO. Before we move on to take your questions, I will make some comments about our Q4 results. Let's start with revenue.   For the fourth quarter, worldwide net sales were $149.2 billion, representing an increase of 12% year-over-year, excluding approximately 360 basis points of unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and above the top end of our Q4 guidance range. We've seen that during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money.  Throughout Amazon's history, we have found that our focus on the customer helps to set us apart in times like these. This past holiday season, customers came to Amazon for great deals, fast delivery and our widest-ever selection, bolstered by nearly 2 million third-party seller partners who sell on Amazon. Enterprise customers continued their multi-decade shift to the cloud while working closely with our AWS teams to thoughtfully identify opportunities to reduce costs and optimize their work.   In our worldwide stores business, with the ongoing economic uncertainty, coupled with the continuation of inflationary pressures, customers remain cautious about their spending behavior. We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower-priced items and value brands in categories like electronics. We also saw them continue to spend on everyday essentials, such as consumables, beauty and softlines. Our teams worked hard to offer low prices and secure millions of deals for customers in Q4, including our first-ever Prime Early Access Sale in October and the more traditional Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday holiday weekend. These global sales events outperformed our expectations as customers responded to millions of deals across our growing selection. Third-party sellers remain a key contributor to that expanding selection.   In Q4, sellers comprised a record 59% of overall unit sales. Sellers, vendors and brands continue to look to Amazon's advertising capabilities to reach customers in the always competitive holiday season, even as the macro environment required them to scrutinize their own marketing budgets.   We saw good growth in advertising revenues in Q4, up 23% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Prime membership continues to be a great value for our customers, and improving our Prime benefits is a continuous part of our investment strategy. Along with competitive pricing, broad selection and faster delivery speed, we've seen Prime members respond to our expanding entertainment offerings.   During the quarter, we completed our first season of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the most watched Amazon original series in every region of the world, reaching over 100 million viewers and driving more Prime sign-ups worldwide during its launch window than any previous Prime Video content. We also finished our inaugural season as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football, reaching the youngest median age audience of any NFL broadcast package since 2013 and increasing viewership by 11% from last year among hard-to-reach 18- to 34-year-olds.  In aggregate, we invested approximately $7 billion in 2022 across Amazon Originals, live sports and licensed third-party video content included with Prime. That's up from about $5 billion in 2021. As a reminder, these digital video content costs are included in cost of sales on our income statement. We regularly evaluate the return on the spend and continue to be encouraged by what we see, as video has proven to be a strong driver of Prime member engagement and new Prime member acquisition.   Moving on to AWS. Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions. As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter.   Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term.   As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens. That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.   Now let's shift to worldwide operating income. For the quarter, we reported $2.7 billion in operating income. The operating income was negatively impacted by 3 large items, which added approximately $2.7 billion of costs in the quarter. This was related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment and operating leases and changes in estimates related to self-insurance liabilities. This cost primarily impacted our North America segment. If we had not incurred these charges in Q4, our operating income would have been approximately $5.4 billion. We are encouraged with the progress we continue to make in streamlining the costs in our Amazon stores business. We entered the quarter with labor more appropriately matched to demand across our operations network compared to Q4 of last year, allowing us to have the right labor in the right place at the right time and drive productivity gains.   We also saw continued efficiencies across our transportation network, where process and tech improvements resulted in higher Amazon Logistics productivity and improved line haul fill rates. While transportation overperformed expectations in the quarter, we also saw productivity improvements across our fulfillment centers, in line with our plan.   We also saw good leverage driven by strong holiday volumes. Overall, it was a strong effort by the operations team, and we look forward to making further headway as we head into 2023. We remain focused on driving cost efficiencies throughout the network and reducing our cost to serve our customers, while ensuring we maintain an outstanding customer experience.   Circling back to the 3 large charges during the quarter. Let me share some additional color, starting with the job eliminations we initiated during the fourth quarter. As we consider the ongoing uncertainties of the macroeconomic environment, this led us to the difficult decision to eliminate just over 18,000 roles, primarily impacting our stores and device businesses as well as our human resources teams. As a result, we recorded estimated severance cost of $640 million. These charges were recorded primarily in technology and content, fulfillment and general administration on our income statement.   Next, we recorded impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, primarily related to our Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go physical stores. We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers, will build our grocery brand and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time. As such, we periodically access our portfolio of stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential. We'll also take an impairment on capitalized costs and associated values of our leased buildings. The impairment charge in Q4 was $720 million and is included in other operating expense on our income statement.   We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity, and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels, whether that's online delivery, pickup or in-store shopping. Lastly, during the quarter, we increased our reserves for general product and automobile self-insurance liabilities, driven by changes in our estimates about the cost of asserted and unasserted claims, resulting in additional expense of $1.3 billion. This impact is primarily recorded in cost of sales on our income statement.   As our business has grown quickly over the last several years, particularly as we've built out our fulfillment and transportation network and claim amounts have seen industry-wide inflation, we've continued to evaluate and adjust this reserve for both asserted claims as well as our estimate for unasserted claims.   We reported overall net income of $278 million in the fourth quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net income includes a pretax valuation loss of $2.3 billion included in nonoperating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. As we've noted in recent quarters, this activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations but rather the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in Rivian's stock price.   As we head into the new year, we remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for our shareholders. Everybody, this is Andy. Just before we start with the questions, I just wanted to say it's good to be with you all on the call today. I thought I might jump on the calls from time to time moving forward. And given that this last quarter was the end of my first full year in this role, and given some of the unusual parts in the economy and our business, I thought this might be a good one to join. So thanks for having me. [Operator Instructions]  And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. I have two. Andy, I want to ask you, just the first one, you've been in the seat for a while. As you sit there, what are your key focal points, product categories or investment priorities that you're most focused on to drive durable multiyear growth in that North America retail segment as we recover?   And then the second one, just sort of staying on the North America retail side, how do you think about the potential margin potential of that business over the next few years as you sort of grow into the warehouse? And what are the warehouse network? And what are the efficiency factors to get you to those goals? Brian, this is Brian. First, let me just start with your second question. On the -- sorry, can you hear me? On the expectation for retail margins, especially in North America, what we've said is when we look back to our cost structure pre-pandemic, we were just in the end of 2019, early part of 2020. We're just starting to roll out one-day shipping in North America, and we had an expectation of what our cost structure would look like. That has changed quite a bit in the last 3 years now due to a doubling of our network expansion. I think you've heard me tell this story on different calls.   But essentially, we're now trying to, again, regain our cost structure that we've had in the past, balance the -- and get more efficient on the assets we've added in the last 2, 3 years now and also look at all the investment areas that we are working on to drive growth, continuing to look at them where we need to make course corrections, where we need to change things up. And we expect that, again, a lot of the improvement will be in North America operations costs. We made good headway in 2022. We always want to make more, and we're going to be working on this definitely through 2023 and beyond. But we have to make and expect to make big improvements in 2023. Yes. And I'll start just at a broad level, priority-wise. The connective tissue for everything we do across the company, including in stores in North America, is we realize that we exist to make customers' lives better and easier every day and relentlessly went to do so. And being maniacally focused on the customer experiences, always going to be a top priority for us. At the same time, and this is true in North America as well as across the entire business, we're working really hard to streamline our costs and trying to do so at the same time that we don't give up on the long-term strategic investments that we believe can meaningfully change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over the long term.   As I addressed directly the North American stores questions, I think our -- probably the #1 priority that I spent time with the team on is reducing our cost to serve in our operations network. And as Brian touched on, it's important to remember that over the last few years, we've -- we took a fulfillment center footprint that we've built over 25 years and doubled it in just a couple of years. And then we, at the same time, built out a transportation network for last mile roughly the size of UPS in a couple of years. And so when you do both of those things to meet the huge surge in demand, you're going to -- just to get those functional, it took everything we had. And so there's a lot to figure out how to optimize and how to make more efficient and more productive.   And then I think at the same time, if you think about doubling the number of fulfillment centers you have and then adding a very large transportation network and you realize that all of those facilities have to link together to get products to customers, that's a pretty big expansion in the number of nodes in the network. It becomes a little bit different network. And so to figure out how to be really efficient across all those links and have them be highly utilized and to get the flows in those facilities working the right way, it takes time. So we're working very hard on it. I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q4, and you can see that in some of the results. But that work will extend into '23. So that's first.   I think the second thing, priority-wise, I would talk about is just speed. We believe they're continuing to get products to customers faster, makes customers happier, and they also converted a higher rate when they can see promises of deliveries that are faster. I think selection will always be a very high area of focus for us. We work with hundreds of thousands in the U.S. and millions overall in the world of selling partners. In this past quarter, 59% of the units sold were from our third-party selling partners, and we work very hard to provide unmatched selection. And that matters a lot to customers.   I think pricing being sharp is always important. But particularly in this type of uncertain economy, where customers are very conscious about how much they're spending, having the millions of deals that we put together with our selling partners in the fourth quarter was an important part of the demand that you saw, and we'll continue to work really hard on being sharp on pricing.   And then just the customer experience improvements that we're working all the time, whether it's adding Buy with Prime that allows Prime users to use their Prime benefits on other websites than just Amazon; or adding RxPass in the health care space, where our Prime customers for $5 a month can get all the medicines they're using in unlimited fashion; or whether it's just even in our apparel business, where when you're looking clothing you might buy, being able to see virtually your shoes with that outfit to see how it looks and it changes your customer experience, your buying experience, we will continue to work very hard on those customer experiences, and we have a lot more planned. And the next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Also for Andy, I have two. Just first, how would you evaluate your efforts in grocery thus far? I know you're -- it's a big, huge market. You're attacking it different ways. What are the key steps here that you're focused on to drive greater market share?   And then secondly, how should we think about the strategic importance of some of these emerging bets type of areas like health care and Kuiper and autonomous vehicles, among others? On the first one on grocery, I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us. It's a very large market segment, and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery. And we also believe that over time, grocery is going to be omnichannel. There are going to be a lot of people that order their grocery items online and have it delivered to them, and there are going to be a lot of people who continue to buy in physical stores. But you're going to also see a hybrid of those, where people pick out what they want online and pick it up in stores, or people are in stores and there's something that's not in inventory in the stores, so they go to their app or to a kiosk and order it to be delivered from online. And so I think having omnichannel is going to really matter.   And I think that we have a pretty significant-sized grocery business. I think people sometimes don't realize that and that we've been building for a long time. It's continuing to accelerate, and I kind of see it broken into a few pieces. If you think about the online grocery offering, we have a very large business there. It looks different from the typical mega physical grocery store. But if you think about the aisles in a grocery store, from packaged food to paper products to canned goods to pet supplies to health and personal care items to consumables, we have a very large business there that continues to grow at a rapid clip and then we think will continue to grow.   But it doesn't have a big market segment share in perishables. And if you really want to have significant market segment share in perishables, you typically need physical stores. And we have kind of 2 different offerings there. For what I think is the very best organic physical store experience and selection, we have Whole Foods, which is a very significant-sized business that's continuing to grow. I really like the progress that, that business has made on profitability in the last year. And I like what I see in front of it, and I think that's a very -- it's a premium product, but it's a significant business. It's a good business for us in the grocery space.   I think if you want to have a mass physical store offering, you need a different offering. And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh, and we have a few dozen stores so far. We're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers. It's differentiated in some meaningful fashion and where we like the economics. And we've been -- we've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh doors until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like, but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023. We're working hard at it. We see some encouraging signs. And when we do find that equation, we will expand it more expansively. But I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment. I think we're building a pretty broad grocery network across online and physical, and you're going to see us continue to work on it. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Maybe I'll ask one big picture of Andy and then just a housekeeping matter to Brian, if I can. Andy, keeping on this theme of sort of big picture and strategy and your perspective, I'd love to get your view on the international e-commerce businesses. Obviously, you're in a range of geographies with a wide variance of maturity and different investment cycles. Can you give us your perspective on how you see Amazon's global e-commerce footprint today? And how investors should be thinking about the mix of growth and margin evolution in those international businesses in the years ahead?  And maybe, Brian, if I can just ask a quick follow-up. In the Q1 operating income guidance that you gave, I think there's some confusion among investors as to where you might be capturing some of the restructuring charges from the announcements that the company has made on employee count between Q4 and Q1. Can you just clarify what was captured in Q4 versus what might be included in the way you frame the Q1 operating income guidance? Sure, let me start. This is Brian. Let me start with that second part. So as I said earlier, we took a $640 million charge tied to the position elimination that we announced in Q4. A lot of that fell into Q1 into mid to late January. So the way to think about it is for the terminations in January, the salaries for the first 3 weeks are covered in operating results for Q1. But the period after that, where there's weeks or months of severance coverage, job placement, a lot of those costs are what the $640 million charge was in Q4. So I hope that helps. And on the question about international e-commerce, we're very enthusiastic about the business we're building there. I think just perspective, if you look at the compounded annual growth rate from 2019 to '21, in the U.K., it was over 30%; in Germany, it was 26%; in Japan, it was 21%. And the fact that we haven't given back that growth, and these are all net of FX, but if you look at even the last couple of quarters where we're continuing to grow and we haven't given back some of that growth, a meaningful amount of market segment share has shifted to our global established e-commerce territories, and we're excited about that.  Now we're -- at this stage, we're big enough in our developed international territories that when there's something significant happening in the macro, we're going to be impacted as well. And if you just look in Europe as an example, the inflation is higher than most places, and the impact on Europeans for the war in Ukraine is more significant, and also the energy prices and hikes there are more significant. So you can see that in some of our growth numbers.  And then you look at our emerging countries, and these are -- they're all a little bit different in all -- in a little bit different stage as you recognize in the question. But if you look at countries like India and Brazil and the Middle East and Africa and Turkey, Mexico and Australia and a number of those types of countries, we like what we're seeing. They take a certain amount of time. There's a certain amount of fixed investment you have to make when you enter a new geography, and then you have to drive a certain amount of revenue to be able to cover that fixed investment. But they're all on the right trajectory and following trajectories that roughly look like what we saw in North America and our established international geographies, and we think it's the right investment and believe we're going to have a large profitable international e-commerce business. And the next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Great. Maybe one for Andy and then one for Brian. AWS, if you look at the revenue growth of mid-teens, it implies it could be flattish and even down this quarter. So maybe talk about what's driving that. Is it workload changes? Are there some clients that are shifting? Anything on the market share you could comment on?  And then second, when do you think this could recover? Like what's the time frame? And would you expect margins to come back when revenues reaccelerate? I'll leave it at that. Thanks, Justin, for your question. This is Brian. Let me start with the -- what we're seeing at the customer level. So as I've mentioned, continuing -- it's across all industries. There are some points of weakness, things like financial services, like mortgage companies that do. As mortgage volumes down, some of their compute challenges or compute volumes are down. Crypto is -- lower trading in crypto. And things tied to advertising, as there's lower advertising spend, there's less analytics and compute on advertising spend as well.  But -- so there's [ select of things ]. But by and large, what we're seeing is just an interest and a priority by our customers to get their spend down as they enter an economic downturn. We're doing the same thing at Amazon, questioning our infrastructure expenses as well as everything else. And we -- there's things you can do. You can defer -- you can switch to lower-cost products. You can run calculations less frequently. There's just -- you can do different types of storage on your data. So there's ways to alter your cost and your bill in a short period of time. I think that's what we're seeing. And as I said, we're working with our customers to help them do that. And again, we're seeing ourselves at Amazon. So I'll let Andy add some color on kind of the general trends in AWS, but that's more what we're seeing at the customer level right now. So I would just add -- I mean, I think Brian covered a bunch of it. I think most enterprises right now are acting cautiously. You see it with virtually every enterprise, and we're being very thoughtful about streamlining our costs as well. And when you are being cautious, you look for ways that you can find -- you can spend less money. And where companies can cost optimize or, in some cases, they may be used to doing analysis over 90 days of information and they say, \"Well, can I get away with it for 2 weeks, doing 2 weeks' worth,\" it's not necessarily the best thing long term. But a lot of companies will do that when they're in uncertain economic situation.  And the reality is that the way that we've built all our businesses, but AWS in this particular instance, is that we're going to help our customers find a way to spend less money. We are not focused on trying to optimize in any one quarter or any one year, we're trying to build a set of relationships in business that outlast all of us. And so if it's good for our customers to find a way to be more cost effective in an uncertain economy, our team is going to spend a lot of cycles doing that.  And it's one of the advantages that we've talked about since we launched AWS in 2006 of the cloud, which is that when it turns out you have a lot more demand than you anticipated, you can seamlessly scale up. But if it turns out that you don't need as much demand as you had, you can give it back to us and stop paying for it. And that elasticity is very unusual. It's something you can't do on-premises, which is one of the many reasons why the cloud is and AWS are very effective for customers.  I think -- and I've spent a fair bit of time with the AWS team on this, and we look closely at what we see. We have a very robust, healthy customer pipeline, new customers, migrations that are set to happen. A lot of companies during times of discontinuity like this will step back and think about what they want to change strategically to be in a position to reinvent their businesses and change their customer experiences more quickly as uncertain economies emerge, and that often means moving to the cloud. We see a number of those pieces as well.  And we're the only ones that really break out our cloud numbers in a more specific way. So it's always a little bit hard to answer your question about what we see. But we, to our best estimations, when we look at the absolute dollar growth year-over-year, we still have significantly more absolute dollar growth than anybody else we see in this space. And I think some of that's a function of the fact that we just have a lot more capability by a large amount, with stronger security and operational performance and a larger partner ecosystem.  So I think it's also useful to remember that 90% to 95% of the global IT spend remains on-premises. And if you believe that, that equation is going to shift and flip, I don't think on-premises will ever go away, but I really do believe in the next 10 to 15 years that most of it will be in the cloud if we continue to have the best customer experience, which we have to work really hard at an event which we're working to do. It means we have a lot of growth in front of us in the AWS business. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Maybe a bigger high-level question here just around Prime member engagement and just seeing third-party seller services growth accelerating in the quarter. And I believe it was mentioned that customer is spending more on everyday essentials, which may be a relatively new use case. Talk just a little bit more, maybe Andy and Brian, just around how engagement is evolving here for Prime members and really how this has grown wallet share over time and where this is going. Yes. Thanks, Ron, for your question. I would say that the Prime membership is -- remains strong and so has the dollars purchased per Prime member. It varies a bit by geography. But in general, if you step back, we had some very large video properties that we had launched last year, Thursday Night Football and Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power. Both of them had record sign-ups for Prime membership. And we know that, again, investments like that will help with not only a new member or new Prime member acquisition, but also retention. And we see a direct link between that type of engagement and higher purchases of everyday products on our Amazon website.  So the health of Prime is very strong. As Andy mentioned earlier, we are continuing to work to get our speed of delivery up to get more one-day shipments. And we think that will also be well received by Prime members. But it's a combination of price selection and convenience. I think we've made inroads on all of them, especially with the third-party selection that's been added over the last few years. So I think testament to that is the sales that we had in the fourth quarter. In a very competitive and deal-driven environment, people came, Prime members and others came to Amazon to do their shopping. So we're encouraged by it. Just to add really one piece here, which is just, if you step back and think about a lot of subscription programs, there are a number of them that are $14, $15 a month really for entertainment content, which is more than what Prime is today. If you think about the value of Prime, which is less than what I just mentioned, where you get the entertainment content on the Prime Video side and you get the shipping benefit, the fast shipping benefit you can't find elsewhere and you get the music benefit, you get the Prime Gaming benefit and you get the photos benefit and you get the Buy with Prime capability, use your Prime subscription on websites beyond just Amazon and some of the grocery benefits that we provide, and RxPass like we just launched to get a number of medications people take regularly for $5 a month unlimited, that is remarkable value that you just don't find elsewhere. And we will continue to add things to Prime and continue to experiment with lots of different features and benefits. But it's still early days. And as we continue to make the service better and better and fully featured, we see people continuing to spend more at Amazon across our various businesses. So we're optimistic about it. And our final question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Two questions. Brian, just any color on why mid-teens is kind of a holdable growth rate for AWS over the next couple of quarters, given what looks like pretty clearly, continuing deterioration in enterprise demand?  And then, Andy, I wonder at a high level if you could just talk about how your priorities may have changed or the company's priorities may have changed over the last year or so as you've been the CEO. And it looks like there's a bit of a peel back on devices, a peel back on physical stores, except for groceries and then maybe a little bit more of a lean in on health. And I'm not quite sure what you're doing with entertainment content spend like that. Maybe it's the same, maybe it's a little bit more. But just at a high level, how would you say your priorities have changed or are different than the prior CEOs? So on the AWS growth rate, I'm not sure I can forecast for you with any level of certainty what is going to happen beyond this quarter. You kind of -- this is a bit uncharted territories economically. And as we mentioned, there's some unique things going on with the customer base that I think many in this industry are all seeing the same thing.  So I don't have a crystal ball on that one, but we are going to continue to work for to be there for our customers. And as I said in the earlier comments, we do have new deals. We have new workloads coming to the cloud. The value was there. And whether there's short term, perhaps short-term belt tightening in the infrastructure expense by a lot of companies, I think the long-term trends are still there. And I think the quickest way to save money is to get to the cloud, quite frankly.  So there's a lot of long-term positive in tough economic times. Saw that in 2020 when volumes for customers shifted very quickly. It led to a resurgence after that and probably acceleration of people's journeys to the cloud, and we'll just have to see if that happens again with what we're seeing today. Yes. I would say I think for any leadership team, each era is different, and it's often meaningfully impacted by what's happening around you. And I think that if you look at the last couple of years with things like the pandemic and the labor shortage in 2021 and the war in Ukraine and inflation and uncertain economy, good leadership teams look around and try to figure out what that means and how they should adjust their businesses.  And so if you look at -- in the early part of 2022, I think we realized that as we tried to make sure we met the surge in demand for consumers and sellers and having to make decisions in 2020 for what fulfillment network investments we're going to make in 2022, we just had more capacity than we needed. And you saw us in the early part of 2022 delay some of our builds and mothballed some of our facilities to try and be more economic.  And I think when we look at some of our physical business investments, physical store investments, I think there were just some areas where we didn't have conviction that they were going to be big needle movers for Amazon. And so that's why we closed down our 4-Star bookstores. And as we got into the early part of the summer, where we start our operating planning process, we -- and there was a lot of things happening in the macro economy, we started that process with the high-level tenet of we want to find a way to meaningfully streamline our costs in all of our businesses, not just their existing large businesses, but also in some of the investments we're making. We want to actually do a pretty good, thorough look about what we're investing and how much we think we need to, but doing so without having to give up our ability to invest in the key long-term strategic investments that we think could change broad customer experiences and change Amazon over time.  And you saw that process led to us choosing to pause on incremental headcount as we tried to assess what was happening in the economy, and we eliminated some programs in fabric.com and Amazon Care and Amazon Glo and Amazon Explore. We decided to go slower on some -- on the physical store expansion in the grocery space until we had a format that we really believed in rolling out and we went a little bit slower on some devices, and until we made the very hard decision that Brian talked about earlier, which was the hardest decision I think we've all been a part of, which was to reduce or eliminate 18,000 roles. And so those were all done with an eye towards trying to streamline our cost but still be able to invest in the things that we think really matter over the long term.  Now we have a way of looking at investments that is different maybe from some other companies. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. It's just the way we look at it, which is when we think about big areas to invest in, we ask ourselves a few questions. We ask, if we were successful, could it really be big and move the needle at Amazon, which is a high bar at a place like Amazon? Do we think it's being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have some competence in those areas? And if we don't, can we acquire them quickly? And if we like the answers to those questions, we will invest.  Sometimes, that leads to very logical extensions for people. When I got to Amazon 25 years ago, we were a books-only retailer. And when we expanded into music and video and electronics, that seemed pretty natural to people. Amazingly, people were very surprised we were expanding into tools. That seemed far field for people, but it turned out not to be.  When we launch something like Buy with Prime, I think people see that as more predictable. That process has also led us to less predictable investments. And I remember, I had a front-row seat in the AWS experience, having worked with the team and led the team from the very start. And I remember both externally and internally, there were a number of people who wondered why we were doing that. It was so different from retail only. But think about how different a company Amazon would be today if we hadn't invested in AWS.  And so that informs some of the other meaningful investments we're making beyond our stores, in retail and advertising and AWS businesses. I think that while we've gone slower in some devices and things, we still -- when we look at the answers to those 4 questions, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in streaming entertainment devices, our low Earth orbit satellite and Kuiper, health care and a few other things. And I think that do I think every one of our new investments will be successful? History would say that, that would be a long shot. However, it only takes one or two of them becoming the fourth pillar for Amazon for us to be a very different company over time.  So I think it's very worthwhile. We're going to continue to invest. We're going to be very thoughtful about how we streamline our costs, and I think you see a lot of that, but we're also going to continue to invest for the long term. Thank you for joining us today on the call and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least 3 months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter."

         "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.   And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Thank you. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.   Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the December quarter spanned 14 weeks, while the March quarter, as usual, has 13 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations.   These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.   I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.   Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year-over-year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day.   Let me discuss the 3 factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year-over-year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track.   The second factor, which we described in a November 6 update was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continued to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be.   The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances, from inflation to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create.   Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone. Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone.   During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac.   Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be.   During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors.   Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year-over-year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified.   We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S. and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get e-mails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them.   We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad and Mac.   Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just 7 years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem.   We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions.   Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited. And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring.   During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri and other apps.   Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season.  At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID and advanced data protection for iCloud.   At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial, equity and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity.   During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with (RED), Apple-supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need.   As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been.   With that, I'll turn it over to Luca. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets.   Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call.   Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products.   The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China. We also set records in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And Services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin.   Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion.   Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments.   In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family.   Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. There were 3 key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research.   iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by 2 key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product.      Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to our smartwatch that we've ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.  Moving to Services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total and for many Services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew Services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago.  We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record.  Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly 4x what we had just 5 years ago.  And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season.  Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.  Turning to the enterprise market. we are seeing continued adoption of our Services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process.  Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time.  As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.  In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of 5 percentage points.  For Services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds.  We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.  Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023.  With that, let's open the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please. Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS. So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward? This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.  In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from 3 countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.  I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last 3 years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. And I think it's -- I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate.  In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently. Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse. Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margins. The guidance, especially at 43.5% to 44.5%, is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things. And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up. Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board.  Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months.  For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins. And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China? What you're seeing -- obviously, you've had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying? And how are you thinking about your position there? Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant -- the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously, the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country also impacted the demand during the quarter.  When you look at the opening that started happening in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to November. And that followed through to demand as well. And I don't want to get into January. We've obviously -- January is included in the guidance, or the color rather, that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November. Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley. Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year-over-year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points. And so I guess my 2 questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up. Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change. Two -- I'll correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year-over-year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just 2 examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future. And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me. Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year ago quarter. Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that.  In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down. And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it.  In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. I have 2 as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line. Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as maybe benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point. Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included. And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points, versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance. And so obviously, components are a big part of that. Yes. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the Services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there. Yes. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG. I mean these things have literally saved people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around. But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down towards the lower end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no? It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say. All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about Services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in Services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in Services, what do you think drives the growth more so? Is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those 2 buckets as you go forward? Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. Installed base is the engine for Services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers. So that's incredibly important.  The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future. And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time.  The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants. And so obviously, payment services are -- continue to set new highs all the time for us.  And then as you've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our Services business. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler. Tim, I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India. Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence. And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year-over-year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.  We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those 2 markets. Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products? We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. I -- we don't know at this point exactly what that will be, but we're all in, in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona. I'm very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice towards higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up. The Pro has been a -- the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them -- couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations and the product speak for themselves. And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand. And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited? I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us, the iPhone has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and -- for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category. Okay. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base? Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last 7 years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets. We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last 7 years. So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time. Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Arete Research LLP. Operator, can we move on to the next? Next, we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID, we've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher speed transmissions. And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever? And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoot of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past 2 years? Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there. We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India. And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of Services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on Services? It was -- Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily the -- this level of engagement we saw, which then reflects into the, as you said, the paid subscriptions. We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Music was very strong. So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.  And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago. So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company. I have 2. The first one, Tim and Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften, and it has an impact. And as consumers tighten their belt, when you look across your hardware products and service businesses, where are you seeing the biggest impact and where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up. We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone. Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the Mac. The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also. How do you think about the Mac relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that? The industry is very challenged, as you say. It's -- the industry is contracting. I think from us, though, is -- and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year. But over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable-sized market, a big market. And we have low share, and we have a competitive advantage with Apple silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.

         "Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson,  Executive Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Jason, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.  Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck, along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content, at shareholder.ford.com.  Today's discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 24. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume-weighted.  I want to call out a few near-term key IR engagements. On February 15, Jim Farley and John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Rod Lash at the Wolfe Global Auto, Auto Tech and Mobility Conference. On March 23, at the New York Stock Exchange, we will hold a teach in about our new Ford+ segment reporting. This event, featuring John Lawler and Cathy O'Callaghan, our Controller, will be webcast. And I'm also pleased to share that our next Capital Markets Day will be Monday, May 22, at our headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Please save the date. We'll have more information about this over the coming weeks.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jim. Thanks, Lynn, and hi, everyone. We appreciate you all joining us. I'll start by addressing the obvious.  Our fourth quarter and full year financial performance last year fell short of our potential. And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts. And to say I'm frustrated is an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford.   Now I know the question you must be asking, why Ford with that incredible product lineup, and all the restructuring overseas, why aren't you delivering higher profits and more competitive margins? And it's the right question. So let me share my perspective.  With Ford+ plan, we are executing a double transformation. While we're making progress, it's hard work. As with any transformation of this magnitude, certain parts are moving faster than I expected and other parts are taking longer.  Now the first part of our transformation is to completely overhaul our industrial system, product development, manufacturing and supply chain management to deliver better cost and quality. This is critical because it provides the foundation for everything else we do. It funds our future, that second transformation, which we're aggressively building today. Building new and incredible new growth businesses like Model e and, of course, Ford Pro are huge bet on commercial vehicles, which will be high-growth, high-margin, not just products but software and services business.  Now the second transformation, the growth part, is going better than I imagined. At this point in our journey, I did not expect to be #2 in EV sales in the U.S. I didn't know that Lightning would be completely sold out. And I didn't predict that BlueCruise would be the best hands-free autonomy system in the market, or the Ford Pro software sales would be growing off the charts. And that doesn't even touch all the incredible next-generation EVs and software platforms that will soon be entering the market.  Bottom line, in a double transformation, we have to significantly improve our cost and our quality, but at the same time, grow to fulfill that huge promise in Ford+. And frankly, the first part of the transformation has not moved fast enough.  Now this is what we should be known for. It's our legacy, and we'll show we can do it again. We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out. Candidly, the strength of our products and revenue has masked this functionality for a long time. It's not an excuse, but it's our reality, and we're dealing with it urgently.  Over the past year, we have made sweeping leadership changes and brought in world-class talent to re-energize and rebuild a leading industrial organization. We've committed company-wide to implement a lean operating system that will scrub billions of dollars of waste out of our company.  And we are shining the light on every inch of our legacy business with knowledge that we must do better every day. This has been humbling for both me and our team. That said, I've never been more convinced about our plan. I cannot wait to get into work every day because I'm so optimistic about our plan and what we are creating here at Ford.   Now I respect our competition, but I would not trade our places with anyone. Why? Because we have a real strategy to grow. We have incredible products, both on the road and the ones you haven't seen in the pipeline. And I believe we now have a world-class leadership team, made up of new and existing talent ready to compete and win. These strengths will shine through.  Ultimately, the proof will be in our results. That's exactly how it should be. We appreciate those who place their faith in Ford, and we are committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders.  So with that, let me quickly cover some areas of focus. First, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation. And you saw this in the actions we took in Brazil and India and most recently in Argo. And now South America and IMG are healthy and generating sustainable profits. This work is never done and will continue to be the focus for us going forward.  Our balance sheet liquidity remains strong, and our ability to generate free cash flow has really improved significantly. And this is allowing us to accelerate our investment in growth, of course, electrification, but also Pro and software while, importantly, also returning capital to our shareholders. And we now have created 3 distinct customer-facing business segments: Blue, e and Pro, which have given us greater clarity and insights into each of these businesses and how we can improve each of them uniquely.  So let me cover a couple of highlights. I'm going to start with Pro, my favorite, the not-so-secret weapon at Ford. Ford Pro embodies all of our growth levers, and it capitalizes on our commercial vehicle sales leadership and scale to build a world-class ecosystem that delivers great value to our customers and profitable growth for us at Ford. In North America, our vehicle share is almost twice that of our closest competitor. And in Europe, Ford has been the #1 vehicle brand -- commercial vehicle brand for 8 years in a row.  Let me bring this point home. Here in North America home market, Super Duty, our most important Pro vehicle, owns half the mining business. It owns half the emergency response business and half the utility business. And the requirements for all these customers are complex. They're not going to commoditize, and they require a partner who deeply understands these unique businesses and is dedicated to providing a mix of vehicles, but also services that can improve uptime and total cost of ownership. And we know these customers will pay for software that will enhance their productivity.  Now we're going to future-proof this business by leading the commercial electrification solutions as well, both at E-Transit and F-150 Lightning today. E-Transit is already America's top-selling electric van, with 73% market share. 60% of all of our U.S. fleet managers plan to add an electric vehicle within the next 2 years to their fleet. And that's even before the $7,500 IRA tax credit that was announced and applies irregardless of the location of raw materials of batteries.   This year, Pro really gets going. We introduced our most important vehicle gets refreshed, the new Super Duty Pickup. And in Europe, the Super Duty equivalent, we have an all-new 1-Tonne Transit. And Ford Pro's high-margin software business will continue to grow, especially software for fleet management, telematics and charging. Last year, these subscriptions for software grew over 70%, reflecting new software offerings, better platform for our software and contracts and growth in fleet charging attach rates, which are close to 50% now.  We're also increasing our sales of parts and services via a network of 1,000 mobile service vehicles on the road in North America and Europe and over 1,400 specialized commercial vehicle dealerships, many of which open 24/7. In fact, last year, mobile service repair orders increased 85% for us in Pro. And this improves the customer experience while importantly increasing the attach rates of our high-margin parts business.   Now moving to Blue. The team is focused and has delivered the freshest and most appealing product lineup in our industry. We know that, typically, the fresher the ICE portfolio, the greater the pricing power. So our decision to move away from sedans and commoditized utilities to vehicles like Bronco Sport and the Big Bronco, the Maverick, the Puma in Europe and hybrid powertrains has really paid off. Ford gained nearly 1 point of market share here in the U.S. last year, and we expect 2023 to be another big, strong year of share growth.   Ford Blue is a growth business for the foreseeable future, with strong profits and robust free cash flow. And F-Series was America's best-selling truck for 46 consecutive year now, outselling its second-place competitor by more than 140,000 trucks. We're launching even new pickups like the new Ranger here in North America and in South America after we've already launched the new Ranger in Asia and Europe last year.   In addition, Blue is going after billions of cost improvements from engineering to manufacturing to our bill of material. And in quality, we have work to do. Ford has been the #1 in recalls in the U.S. for the last 2 years. Clearly, that's not acceptable. We've overhauled our entire enterprise quality operating system. And we are already seeing improvements in initial quality for vehicles coming out of our plants here in North America.   And Model e. It's operating with a start-up intensity to build profitable EVs with differentiated industry-leading portfolios that customers are going to love. In the U.S., our EV sales growth is twice the rate of the EV segment and more than 60% of our Model e customers are new to Ford. The F-150 Lightning has been America's best-selling electric pickup since it launched. And the Mustang Mach-E remains a huge hit for our customers.  We remain on track to reach our annualized EV production capacity of 50,000 units per month or 600,000 units globally by the end of this year. For reference, in the fourth quarter, our run rate of production was more like 12,000. So 50,000 is a big growth. And by the end of -- and we are on plan for that 2 million units of incremental capacity by the end of 2026.  Now to deliver this incredible growth, as we speak, throughout facilities in North America, we're adding shifts, expanding our facilities, building out new battery capacity and assembly capacity. Construction is in full swing in Tennessee and Kentucky on our BlueOval  City and our 3 BlueOval  SK battery plants. And in Europe, we're moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey.   Now critical to our plan is securing the necessary raw materials for these batteries to get to that 2 million unit rate, especially lithium and lithium hydroxide and nickel. We expect to have 100% of raw materials we need for the 2 million unit run rate secured by the end of this year. Now we are deep in the development of our second-generation EVs, including our next-generation electric full-size pickup, which, by the way, is awesome.   These EVs will be fully software-updatable. That means a brand-new electric architecture, and they're going to be radically simplified. Imagine 3 body styles, each with volume potential of up to 1 million units and just a handful of orderable combinations. That's what we're doing at Ford for the second generation of products. And that means higher customer sat, better quality, lower bill of material and lower manufacturing cost.   When we start reporting according to these new segments in the fourth quarter, you're going to have complete visibility in the Model e's margin trajectory and understand the key levers to achieve our Model e EBIT target of 8%. We're already making the customer-buying experience better with less friction. Now this is only going to accelerate when the new Model e dealer program takes effect in January next year. This program has been adopted by nearly 2/3 of our 3,000 U.S. dealers, and it's based on a radical redesign on our customer experience.  Next January, we'll be selling EVs in high volume with virtually no  inventory, a simple e-commerce platform for our customers, non-negotiated price set by the local dealer and remote pickup and delivery for all customer experiences. We're also expanding BlueOval  charging network at all of our dealers. And we'll have dealer staff trained not only on software but all the EVs.   Now I've said before, software and experiences will be the key differentiator for our industry. I mentioned earlier that BlueCruise, our driver-assist, hands-free technology, was just tested by Consumer Reports and judged the best hands-free autonomous system on the market. Let that sink in for a while. The best on the market. Now have you not experienced BlueCruise, I challenge you to go out and do your side-by-side comparison with our 2 major competitors.   And at the end of last year, our customers using BlueCruise have now traveled 42 million hands-free miles. So we're scaling incredibly rapidly. That's a fourfold increase in the millions of miles since the second quarter of last year. And we have incredible software talent, making this system better every day, including those 600 former Argo engineers who are now working full time at Ford on our autonomous systems.  Now before I hand it over to John, just a few things. Ford is a different company today. We're all about building a stronger customer-focused business that generate sustainable profitable growth and returns above the cost of capital. While our 2022 results fell short of my expectations, I've never been more excited about our future because we have the right plan, the right structure to succeed, the best team on the field and real strategic clarity.  This year is about execution. It's time for us to deliver, and we will with relentless attention to our founding principles, drift and growth, and we are hitting the ground running. John? Thanks, Jim. As Jim pointed out, our performance in 2022 was below our expectations, and our industrial platform is frankly not where we need it to be. The simple way I measure this is by looking at our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and then compare it to our competition. We've all done it, we're much higher.  And this speaks to the significant operating deficits we have in product development, manufacturing and procurement. And this is no different from the tough capital allocation choices we made upon our geographic footprint and product portfolio. Choice is designed to yield higher quality growth and improved returns. And we are now applying that same level of discipline to our industrial platform with urgency.  Now on the positive side, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Our new vehicles are a hit with our customers. Our iconic vehicles remain market leaders, and we continue to make strategic and capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position and produce returns above our cost of capital.   So turning to the year. We generated a record $9.1 billion in free cash flow, well above our cash conversion target of 50% to 60%. And importantly, most of the free cash flow came from the Automotive business. And this reflects more disciplined capital allocation, including the restructuring of our operations outside of North America, which, until recently, was a significant source of cash burn.   Now our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 million of liquidity. This, coupled with the improvement in free cash flow, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our growth and return capital to our shareholders. In fact, today, we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, reflecting our strong free cash flow and the monetization of our Rivian stake, which is now nearly complete. Going forward, we intend to target distributions of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, consistent with our focus on total shareholder return.  Now for the year, we delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.6%. And as Jim said, by better executing the things we control, we should have generated as much as $2 billion more in adjusted EBIT. For example, the instability of our supply chain and production plans caused us to not only deliver lower-than-planned volumes in the fourth quarter but also incur higher costs through premium freight and other supplier charges.   Now let me give you a quick overview of how our '22 segments performed, recognizing that beginning with our first quarter 2023 results will no longer have the Automotive segments with regional breakouts. Now North America delivered $9.2 billion of EBIT, an improvement of $1.8 billion, driven by higher net pricing and increased volume, which was partially offset by higher commodities and other inflation-related cost increases. EBIT margin was 8.4%. We continue to maintain a healthy order bank. And the team is busy preparing the launch of the all-new Super Duty and our seventh generation Mustang later this year, and both of those are incredible products.   In South America, we delivered a profit of over $400 million, and the region is now derisked and sustainably profitable. In Europe, we were slightly above breakeven for the year. But as our fourth quarter results showed clearly below our target. Given the changing macroeconomic environment and demand environment in Europe, we will make the changes necessary to deliver a sustainable business that consistently generates returns above our cost of capital.   Our core strength in the region continues to be our leading commercial vehicle business. In China, we posted a loss of about $600 million, driven by increased investment in EVs. Lincoln continues to be our profit pillar in the region, but clearly, we have more work to do to ensure our business is growing, sustainable and delivering appropriate returns. Our International Markets Group earned more than $600 million, driven by the launch of the all-new Ranger and our decision to exit India. And similar to South America, the region is now primed for sustainable profitability.   And finally, Ford Credit had another solid year, delivering EBT of $2.7 billion, which was down $2.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin and lower lease return rates. Now given the continued uncertainties in the macro environment, I want to provide some context to how we're thinking about 2023.    For the full year, we expect to earn $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that assumes a SAAR of 15 million units in the U.S. and 13 million units in Europe. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and for capital expenditures to be between $8 billion to $9 billion. Our adjusted EBIT guidance includes various headwinds and tailwinds and that we believe could impact our business in the coming year.  And for example, when you think about the headwinds, they include an expected mild recession in the U.S. and a moderate recession in Europe; higher industry incentives as supply and demand come back into balance; Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, and that's about $1.4 billion lower than in 2022, reflecting unfavorable lease residual and credit losses and the nonreoccurrence of derivative gains.  We expect a continued strong dollar. We also expect about $2 billion lower past service pension income. And we're also going to continue investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services and CapEx as we build out our growth plan. Now tailwinds include improvements in supply chain and industry volume, launch of our all-new Super Duty and then, of course, lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of our industrial platform.  Now before taking questions, let me briefly touch on our new financial reporting as well as plans for our next Capital Markets Day. On March 23, we'll hold a teach in at the New York Stock Exchange. And I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will be our chance to take you through how the new Ford+ segment will alter our financial reporting. The changes will include how revenue, cost products and assets are assigned to each segment.  At the teach in, we'll also share our recast financials for both 2021 and 2022, and we hope many of you join us at the New York Stock Exchange in person. But we will also broadcast a webcast live and we'll be -- and we'll post a toolkit and other materials to orient you around all the materials and help you migrate your models. Now the teach in will  not be a strategic update. That will come at our Capital Markets Day in Dearborn in May, when we'll update you on our Ford+ strategy. We'll do a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our new segments as well as for software and services.  Now with this new level of transparency, which will be tracked and validated in our earnings materials and SEC filings, we think investors will be better equipped to value how each of our customer-focused segments is contributing to Ford's overall growth and return profile.  And as Jim mentioned earlier, 2023 is a pivotal year for Ford. We have the plan, the talent and the product portfolio in place to take the company to an exciting new level, one that is both differentiated from our past performance and our competitors. And going forward, our new segmentation will provide unprecedented levels of transparency and insight into all aspects of our business, making it easier to hold Ford leadership accountable for delivering superior growth and value for all of our stakeholders.  Now that wraps up the prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. So thank you. And operator, please open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. I appreciate the humility and the self-criticism and the spirit of that on the cost and the execution shortfall. It's kind of refreshing to see that. But when you began the description about it and how frustrated you are, Jim, and how it's not good enough, I was getting all excited to hear some details and there's just not a lot here, okay? I'm just going to say, it's not a lot of details at all about what exactly the problem is and what you're doing about it and how much can it get better this year?   You can disagree if you want, that is my impression. I want to know what it is and because $2 billion on the table, frankly, that's 130 bps of margin. I mean that's going to go to the consumer anyway. So tell us that's just the beginning, and there's way more to go. Do we have to wait until May for that? Or is there anything else you can tell us to help model the company in the year ahead and what you're doing about it? Appreciate it. Thanks, Adam. No, there's a lot more to go. And the industrial system at Ford is a huge opportunity for us. And we have spent the last several months really getting deep on where we need to go. So John, maybe you could share or feeling comfortable on sharing, but you're going to hear a drumbeat from Ford on this all during the year. Yes. So Adam, I think if you just step back and look at the 3 elements of the industrial platform, there's opportunities across each. If you look at our product development system and in our engineering, the level of productivity that we have, so think about $1 of input and what you get out for that $1 of input is probably about 25% to 30% inefficient. So we should be either getting more product through the pipeline or our cost should be significantly lower.  Now we have to be very smart about how we go about doing that because we've got incredible products in the pipeline, and there's a huge opportunity on that front, but we also have to balance the quality as well. And so when it comes to our engineering, I think you should think about it that way, and that's what we're going after.  Our supply chain, there are issues across the supply chain. It cost us, as we talked about last year, at least $1 billion in premiums that we had to pay, increased freight, premiums on chips, premiums on disruption that we called our suppliers because our schedule stability was probably worst in class. And fixing that and the root cause it gets to that will drive incredible opportunities for us. And let's say that for 2023, it should be at least an incremental $1 billion, at least.  And then when you look at our manufacturing system and you go through our plants, you look at the level of working capital we have in, you look at our production schedules, you look at the complexity and what it does for time that takes us to build a vehicle. And you understand just how inefficient that is. And then you bring that back through that -- complexity back through the supply chain. And you talked about the number of changeovers that our suppliers have to make to produce the complexity that we have and the time that it adds to production and the time that it adds the cost and the issues that it drives through.  So those are just some of the tip of the iceberg or the things we're going after. And then if you go back and you look at it, as I said in my remarks, just you look at the math and you look at our cost of goods sold relative to our revenue and then compare that to traditional OEMs, let alone the new OEMs, and you see the size of the prize that we're going after.  And what's changed, Adam, I think the answer is, is we just have to show you guys. I mean that's where we're at. We have to deliver it. But as Jim said, as we're taking this lean approach and getting into it, there's a very systematic way we're going at it now, and we are very focused. And we know that this is the number one thing that needs to get fixed in the first part of our transformation. And Adam, I'd just like to add, as the CEO, there's a lot of choices. They're all very consequential when it comes to the approach to do this. The most important thing for me is sustainable. When you look at Ford, we have cut in the past, and it grows back. Or we have cut everywhere and not really focused on the industrial system.  So for me, the approach that we're taking that's very different and very difficult is that it has to be daily work, gaps to competition, countermeasures, action plans for those countermeasures, constant evaluation of the effectiveness of those countermeasures, celebration of those KPIs and our status and daily management. It has to be a more fundamental approach than holding our breath or dealing with the output like people and getting into the real industrial system's efficiency. And that is a cultural change as a leader. It's a behavioral change. It is not just a program. Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Just kind of wanted to follow up sort of on a similar vein, short term and long term. Just for short term, when we think about the '23 outlook and you look at the $1.4 billion decline in Ford Credit and take that as a reasonably given number, something in that direction, and then $2 billion of lower past service pension income, that's a $3.4 billion headwind. But sort of at the midpoint of the range, you're talking about EBIT being roughly flat. So that sort of indicates a very significant $3 billion-plus improvement in the core business, which is a lot to kind of believe when you're looking at sort of the headwinds and the issues that you just faced.  I'm just curious if you can comment on that and maybe kind of walk us to how we get comfortable like that we'll see a $3 billion-plus improvement in the core business this year. I mean -- and how do you get these supply chain issues fixed when some of that are a bit outside of your control and what we hear from suppliers is volatility and schedules. And it's not just specific to Ford, still pretty volatile. Yes. Thanks, John. It's a great question. That's exactly it. The headwinds are $4.5 billion to $5 billion, as we pointed out. And we said we expect on the tailwinds, our pricing to be about neutral. The market forces, I think, are going to drive average transaction prices down, we think probably around 5%. And that will come some from the dealer margins, but also from higher incentives.  And then you step back from it, and we do have the new Super Duty. And we expect that to be a positive, and we also have a very strong order bank on our commercial vehicles. So we're looking at pricing being about flattish. We said volumes, there's a slight opportunity as industry comes along. So the rest of it falls into cost reductions, and that's exactly right.  When you look at those cost reductions, you have to see what's happening relative to the material. And in material, there's 2 phases there. There's one, it's -- we do expect commodity prices to come off a bit, to improve a bit. But we also have significant opportunities in our material cost, and we have several initiatives going on to identify those efficiencies.  We also have quite a bit of cost when you talk about schedule stability. I don't have the exact data from the competition, but when I look at our schedule stability, there are significant opportunities through changes that we can take to improve that schedule stability, which will flow straight through to lower surcharges from the supply base because they have to deal with that instability and there's cost that, that drives as well as the significant premiums we paid in freight for expedite, air freight, et cetera, to just try to keep plants going and keep our suppliers' plants going.  So those are 2 immediate actions that we can take based on the inefficiencies we saw in '22 that cost us the $2 billion. And then on top of that, we have to build through the core industrial platform just productivity and efficiencies to drive even more improvements. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's how we're going about it. Okay. That's actually incredibly helpful. And just on the long term, I mean, you mentioned, Jim, about scrubbing things foundationally and really getting to some costs that are excess. And I appreciate the 3 areas you've highlighted. But as we look around the world, I mean, Europe is -- had fits and starts of making us all kind of excited that it's going to work and then it doesn't from time to time. And China, you kind of been chasing competition there, and it hasn't really paid out for you.  But there are 2 very important parts of Europe and China that are very strong for you. Commercial vehicle in Europe is incredibly strong. So could we just strip Europe back to pure commercial vehicle? And could China just strip back to pure Lincoln? Two places we know you're making money and cut out the other stuff so that you can actually fund the transition that you're talking about. I mean, just -- we kind of all dance around this stuff, and you've headed in this direction with the global redesign, but there's real opportunities here to be really profitable. No, you hit on it. And I'm glad we're getting into some of the strategies. I mean, I would think of China business similar to what we've done in South America and IMG. Small but profitable, focused. We've been, in the past, in China kind of small but focused on everything. And Lincoln and our commercial with JMC is very profitable and an important business, but they have to make the EV transition.  And I don't think you can be globally successful in the EV business if you don't compete with the Chinese. I mean, they're going to come to Europe. They're already there. They're going to come to the U.S. BYD is a powerhouse, Geely, there's so many others. And so we believe China is very strategically important for us. But to win there, we have to make those businesses transition profitably to EV, but I would think of it as kind of small and focused, maybe even more than the past.  And Europe is definitely -- we have a great CV business, commercial vehicle business, that now is getting electrified. So we're like making that transition now. We have a new Ranger, the electric version of Transit, 1-Tonne Transit. And all of them, we have a new manufacturing site in Romania that's really scaling up now in commercial. So we have a really strong business.  And the decision really is how much do we need, how much -- how many engineers, how many people do we need in Europe and how big of a profile do we need in passenger cars? That's the decision. We've already electrified Cologne, and that's really the decision. It's not the right time to talk about where we're going to go, but we know exactly our strength in Europe, and we know what we need to do. So -- and you won't have to wait long to hear from us on these things. The next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. I think, John, you said that, in response to Adam's question, that variable costs would come down by at least $1 billion. But at the same time, you're acknowledging that pricing could easily be more than $1 billion negative for $100 billion North American business with 5 points of average transaction price decline. Can you maybe give us a little bit more insight into that? And can you provide a few specific KPIs that would demonstrate progress on structural costs? They were up another $2 billion in 2022. Yes. So on the pricing, we do see the broad market coming in at about -- transaction prices falling about 5%. Some of that's going to come out of the dealer margins, of course. It's not all going to come from us. But we also have upside, Rod, with some of the launch of the new vehicles. We won't see as much of a price compression there. So we see pricing net-net for us next year being about flattish. And so don't think about it as we're working through '23 as being a negative $1 billion.  And then I would say that when it comes to the cost reductions, I think what we've got to start showing is, one, that we're getting leverage out of the business. If we're growing the business, that our cost of goods sold is growing at a much slower pace. And that as we're coming out with new vehicles, our cost per units are coming down, so our margins are improving.  When you look at the design of our vehicles and you compare it to competition, I think if you go through those benchmarks and you go through those teardowns, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to design out complexity. And you should see that coming through complexity-reduction KPIs on our vehicles. I think that will be key. And it not only will be in the order combinations but also in the parts complexity, in the number of parts.  And what we'll be doing is, as we move forward through this year, especially at Capital Markets Day, we'll be providing more details on those KPIs. But it's the key areas. You should be seeing how much productivity we're getting out of $1 of engineering. And we should do something around that from a KPI standpoint because these are the areas that we need to improve. Rod, some of the things I think about -- some of the things I think about is a number of complex sequencing centers we have. Our line side complexity, number of parts sitting on the side of the line, our inventory turns inside the plant. And on the supplier side, it's going to be transparency. We had full transparency down to Tier 3 in our supply chain. It's very important to operationalize better quality and cost.  On the engineering side, it's also indirect. What's the ratio of indirect to direct engineering that we're spending, i.e., the productive engineering that's resulting in customer-facing products. And increasingly, I know it's going to sound a little bit weird, but it's the software output.  We are spending, as a management team, more and more time on our software platform and the cost of creating software and the complexity of software. And that's something that -- we have a lot of KPIs. They're increasing quickly and are increasingly important for us. It may not be significant for structural cost, but we have to be careful to add a lot of complexity in software. So just to put a landmark out there, do you think a year from now we'll be looking at structural costs that are up or down? Obviously, ex pension, because you have this $3 billion cost reduction plan. And then I have a second question just on Model e. Rod, I think it's beyond just structural cost. Our biggest cost element is our material cost. We will continue to invest in our growth-related investments. So connected services, the software, as Jim talked about. We're also continuing to invest, as you know, in our build-out of our batteries. So our spending-related costs are going to go up.  Volume will drive manufacturing cost, which is in our structural cost. So there will be puts and takes on the structural costs. Our biggest opportunity is in our level of material cost that we have. It's the largest cost element on our income statement, and it's where we are most uncompetitive. Yes. Okay... So we're going after everything, but I... Yes. I think I got the answer on that. Maybe just to switch gears on Model e, if I can ask Jim a question. You've got this target of 8%. And that 8% margin target presumably has some assumptions for where costs will go, but also where pricing is going to go. And just considering everyone's aspirations for growth in EVs, do you think you can stand by those pricing assumptions? And maybe a different way of asking this is, do you think you can sell a $40,000 electric crossover with a 20% gross margin? That is a very important question. The reality is we will -- we are structuring our portfolio to compete in very specific segments. The 2-row crossover is turning out to be the [ core ] civic of the EV business. And the last thing we want to do is commoditize our products by dropping the price. Just look what happened to Henry Ford in the 20s, in the early teens. And that's exactly what we're seeing play out here.  We didn't have to touch the pricing and offer Lightning and E-Transit because we pick the right segments. But the real driver of our future profitability on Model e is the second-cycle products. We didn't know when we designed these first 3 products. We didn't know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be. We didn't know it's 70 pounds heavier, and that that's worth $300 of battery. We didn't know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size. We didn't know that we needed the world's best aerodynamics to get the size of the battery smaller.  And so now we have learned a lot and that second cycle of the product is in the factory right now being developed with a lot of new talent. So I'm very optimistic about our 8% because we are not going to be playing in the 2-row commodity SUV market because that's -- because Ford's tried that in the ICE business It didn't really work out for us.  We want to play our hand, our strength, commercial, truck, larger vehicles on the category side. We do not want to have too many [ top hats ] because that costs a lot to engineer. We want to have minimum choice for customers, but we want to design the smallest possible battery for competitive size. And we want to invest differently in our ICE business for radical simplification. 30%, 40%, 50% less fasteners, no brackets in the vehicle. I can go on and on.  We'll get into it at Capital Markets Day. I think we should expect all brands to protect growth when it comes to EV. And that, or we have to expect negative pricing. And that means software and other items like that becoming even more critical. And I can't wait to show you our new electric architecture because, to me, that's the most critical strategic investment the company is making, not our batteries, not the EV platforms, but our new fully updatable electric architecture. Because what we've learned on Pro is we can make real money on software. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Maybe to follow up on that. I heard you say in the prepared remarks that revenue for software services and charging rose 70% year-over-year in 2022. I remember you discussing like a potential $20 billion market opportunity by 2030 with a lot of excitement on Pro at the last Investor Day, target for 33 million connected vehicles in 2028.  But have you dimensioned how large or profitable this business may be currently? Or are you able to share any more interim goals, such as what your expectations are for services revenue or services revenue growth in  2023? Or what the next catalyst might be here for this business, such as, I don't know, the number of vehicles launching with BlueOval  intelligence or anything else we should be monitoring? Right. Yes, great question. We're going to see that on Pro first, and this year is a breakout year for Pro because we have brand-new products, both core in Europe and U.S. are most -- the highest-volume, the highest-profit vehicles are all new. So a very important year for us.  I would say we absolutely have a fantastic business plan that's very specific about software and physical services. The biggest opportunity for us in the short term is the aftersales business. Only 10% of our Pro customers do business with us, and we hardly do any financing with them. And so between financing and parts and service, we have enormous upside in the short term. And those are very profitable parts of our business.  So I would think of it this way, Ryan. It's like software is starting to drive a closed loop where the customer wants to do more physical service with us. We have all those mobile units, more and more dedicated dealers and more of our commercial customers because of the use of the software is coming back and buying parts for us.  And then the next level of performance is really going to be prognostics. When we could put predictive failure in all the vehicles, like you see on John Deere and Caterpillar, and then drive that into our physical repair facilities, we're going to see a much larger retention in parts and service.  So I think the basics of the business are, these are profitable vehicles. We've got new ones coming out. We're going to grow that. We're -- I mean, we blew through our parts and service profits and revenue for Pro last year. It's almost like we can't even predict as this -- that software starts to really drive a different behavior for our customers, the growth in parts and service.  But that's the monetization in the short term for these services in the integrated ecosystem. And then long term, the real game changer kind of like autonomy in the retail space is going to be that prognostics. Our next question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas. So the third quarter negative pre-announcement had a narrative around it, right? It was very high mix on wheels inventory that you couldn't ship and the additional $1 billion of supplier costs. I know Adam hit on this in his question, but this quarter is missing that storyline.  I know it was mentioned that you have line of sight to $2 billion in profit that you left on the table. But what could really turn around almost immediately in this first quarter in '23 here in terms of like what operational mishaps you know will reverse in the coming months and quarter, whatever the time frame might be? Yes. I think it comes down to the key driver for the miss in the fourth quarter was the volumes. And the volumes was on availability of key commodities, primarily chips, and the fact that many of our suppliers had equipment issues as they were ramping. We think we've worked through a lot of those issues on the ramp in our supply chain.  And as far as the rate inflow on the commodities, the chips, it continues to be hand-to-hand combat. But  we're putting corrective actions in place. We've got better pipelines from brokers and spot buys. And we're working very closely with our supply chain down to the Tier 2 chip suppliers.  So that's execution. It's changes that we're putting in place on the rate and flow, and it's being more efficient in our scheduling and the stability of our production to reduce expedited freight, expedited costs at our supply chain, et cetera. So part of it's operational. Part of it's what we're doing working with our supply chain partners. And part of it is getting through the hump on ramping up run rates, et cetera, throughout the system. Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then in terms of the earnings bridge for this year, with respect to materials and freight, that $9 billion headwind in '22. I know you mentioned you're breaking in commodity prices to come down. But all in, relative to that $9 billion this past year, what's assumed in the '23 guide here on this line item? Right. So if you look at that, it's at least $2.5 billion, depending on where we fall within the range of the guidance. So I think that would be a start point, and then we would go from there. And of course, we're going to be working to do better than that. But that's what we see so far. So at least $2.5 billion positive? Yes. Our last question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Just two questions for me. First, I was hoping you could maybe talk about the regional outlook in your 2023 guidance. I don't know that the segments are about to change, but hoping you could touch on the regions.  And then second, maybe for Jim. When we're thinking about the software opportunity on your new electrical architecture on the consumer side of the business,  where do you see the biggest opportunity there from a revenue perspective? Is it automated driving? Is it connected services? Just curious what is most interesting there. Yes. So... On the regions? Yes. I think what we would have to say is that, given that we're moving to our segments for 2023, we're not going to be reporting the regions. And so we will give more color on 2023 by each of the business unit segments. And so I'm not going to comment on regions anymore going forward, unless there's a specific reason to do that within one of the segments. I think on the demand side, we see the U.S. around the 15 million range, Europe around 13 million. We're going to see more incentives in the U.S. So we can go through the demand side if that's what you're interested in. Yes, sure. That would be helpful. Yes. Maybe pricing in Europe would be helpful as well. Yes. I think in Europe, we're going to see continued pressure on the top line. We've got a 13 million unit in the industry. We think we still have such a strong order bank. We -- not think, we know we have a strong order bank on our commercial vehicles that we don't see as much pressure there. More of the pressure will come on the passenger side.  But pricing in Europe, incentives continue to be strong throughout this year. So I don't think you'll see as much price compression in Europe, as you've seen in -- you'll see in North America and the U.S. But I think, definitely for Europe, it's the call on the industry and where do we think that will be, offset by the strength of the order bank we have on our commercial vehicles.  Coming back to the U.S., as we said, a 15 million unit industry. We think prices are going to come and the industry are going to fall -- transaction prices will fall about 5%. If you think about that, it's about the combination of incentives and lower dealer margins. We're starting to see dealer margins come down now as our demand from the industry is easing a bit. And we're starting to see the inflationary costs come through with the pricing. And so we're starting to see those margins come off.  And I think, as we go through the year, particularly in the second half, you'll start to see prices come down through higher incentives by the OEMs. When you look at our International Markets Group, I think it's a little bit different there. Our key product is Ranger, and that's all new, and that's launching, and so there's incredible demand for it. And so we think we have some pricing power there as well.  So I think there's puts and takes around the region, if you look at it on a macro basis. And I think it will be more insightful as we talk about what's happening in each of the segments and then specifically what's happening in Pro, Blue and e in those segments around the world. On the software side, we were guessing before, but now we kind of know what the first 3 shippable large TAM software revenue sources are for our industry. The first is partial autonomy, the second is safety and security and the third is productivity. And the star people in there, the early leaders, definitely ADAS, on pricing revenue growth.  I mean the growth we're seeing, the demand we're seeing for BlueCruise and all ADAS features is really driving a lot of software shipment. We're about to ship our second cycle of BlueCruise already, and we are really starting to see -- that is clearly what customers want revenue-wise. And I do believe in this first 3, 4 years of software to the car that ADAS, that Level 2, Level 3 system is really the most remarkable TAM.  However, in the background, for Ford, the productivity software in Pro is really important. It's maybe unique to us, but it is a very important part of our software revenue, which we will lay out in May. You'll see more specifics on it, but it's very profitable. The customers love the data, and they have a higher demand for the data and the software than the retail customer.  I think the slow burn, the one in the background that I'm super excited about is the third leg of the stool, the safety and security. Not like someone stole your car, but it's video content, a lot of it tied to insurance. So this is going to be a really interesting area. Kind of think of your cars and extension of your ring and all the safety and security you have in your house now, all that technology, the cars give me another note on that. It will go for everything from teenage drivers to all sorts of things.  And that video capture is going to be the essence. Another reason why we think our next electrical architecture is so strategically important for the company because we want to embed that hardware and software and adaptability in the electric architecture so we can ship the software, better software than our competition on safety and security, even if it's a little fuzzy on what the features are today. This concludes the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
